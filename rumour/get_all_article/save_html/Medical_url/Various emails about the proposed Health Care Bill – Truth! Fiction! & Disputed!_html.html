<p><b>Summary of eRumor:</b></p>
<p align="justify">Several emails circulating about the Obama administration&#8217;s proposed Universal Health Care bill.   One concern is that the passage of this bill will levy an additional capital gains tax on the sales of homes of 3.8%.</p>
<p><b>The Truth:</b></p>
<p>Many eRumors and opinions are still circulating about the Health Care Reform Bill or HR-3200 which was abandoned for a new bill 1990 page bill  <a href="http://docs.house.gov/rules/health/111_ahcaa.pdf">HR-3962</a> titled the  &#8220;Affordable Health Care for America Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>On December 24, 2009 the Senate passed the &#8220;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#8221; by a yea-nay vote of 60-39.  The House version of the 2409 page bill is HR-3590.  On the afternoon of March 18, 2010 Congress announced that the House posted an additional package, HR-4872 &#8211; Reconciliation Act of 2010, that contains 153 pages of fixes to the Healthcare bill.   On March 21, 2010, Congress passed the two bills.</p>

</div></div></div>In November 2010 the Republican Party won majority control of Congress on the campaign promise that they would repeal Obamacare.  The new GOP led Congress met on January 19, 2011 to debate the repeal of the Health Care Reform Law.  They voted 245 to 189 in favor to repeal the bill.    The next step for the bill is to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has vowed to block it.  The text of HR-2 &#8211; Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act  can be found at this link: <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2">Click for HR-2</a></p>

<p align="justify">On October 1, 2013 the Affordable Care Act roll out began with the opening of the long awaited sign up website at <a href="HealthCare.gov" target="_blank"> HealthCare.gov</a>. The roll out was shaky after a series of website crashes as people tried to investigate their health care options.</p>
<p>A short time later letters from insurance companies began to be sent to nearly 5 million people living in the U.S. notifying them of policy terminations because of new regulations set down by the Affordable care act. When people called the insurance companies they were directed to purchase new policies.</p>

<p align="center"><b>HR-3590 eRumors:</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Medical devices sold will now have a  2.3% Excise Tax- <span style="color: #008000;">Truth!<br />
</span> </b>According to the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Medical-Device-Excise-Tax:-Frequently-Asked-Questions"> Internal Revenue Service</a>, &#8220;section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer or importer of the device.&#8221;  This is a 2.3 % of the sale price of taxable medical devices and went into effect January 1, 2013.   Some items are exempt from the tax, such as eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids.   According to the Internal Revenue Service, it is the manufacturer or importer of the taxable medical device who is responsible for paying the excise tax, not the consumer.  Customers should not see any added taxes on their sales slips but the cost of the actual item to customers could increase as a result of this excise tax.</p>
<p>Some versions of this rumor include a photo of a sales slip from a sporting goods chain and allege that the tax is included on sporting equipment.   The tax is not applicable on anything other than the medical devices.  <span style="color: #008000;"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Real estate sales will be taxed 3.8%- <span style="color: #008000;">Mostly Truth! </span> </b><br />
Congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois released a statement on March 21, 2010  on HR-3590 saying that the health care bill will increase taxes &#8220;by imposing a new 3.8% tax on capital gains.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first, it was believed that taxes and surcharges could be imposed on income over $250,000 for single tax filers and $500,000 for married couples filing together.  That imposed tax is to help fund the $210 Billion needed to fund the new Health Care Bill.</p>
<p>According to the National Board of Realtors, the new law will take effect January 1, 2013 and  &#8220;may impose a 3.8% tax on some (but not all) income from interest, dividends, rents (less expenses) and capital gains (less capital losses).&#8221;   It said that this &#8220;tax will fall only on individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) above $200,000 and couples filing a joint return with more than $250,000 AGI.&#8221;</p>
<p align="justify">To help realtors and investors the National Association of Realtors released a brochure that explains the new tax called, <i>The 3.8% Tax Real Estate Scenarios &amp; Examples Effective January 1, 2013. </i> <a href="http://www.realtor.org/small_business_health_coverage.nsf/docfiles/government_affairs_invest_inc_tax_broch.pdf/$FILE/government_affairs_invest_inc_tax_broch.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for a copy of the brochure</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">The actual tax increases may be generated by the HR-4872 Reconciliation Act according a <a href="http://www.lifeandhealthinsurancenews.com/News/2010/2/Pages/House-OKs-HR-3590.aspx"> March 21, 2010 article</a> by Life and Health News Insurance News.</p>
<p align="justify">This is also confirmed in a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/22/news/economy/medicare_tax_increase/index.htm"> March 25, 2010 article</a> by CNNMoney.com that said, &#8220;couples making $500,000 in wages will pay an additional $2,250. If they made $1 million, they would pay an additional $6,750.  In addition, high-income households would also be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013.&#8221;</p>

</i><b>Aspirin Tax become effective June 1, 2013-</b><b><span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span> &amp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Fiction! </span></b><b><br />
</b>Effective June 1, 2013, aspirin will be heavily taxed under Obamacare. The only explanation given was that they are white and they work. No other reason was given, but I thought you&#8217;d want to know about it.</p>

</span></strong></span> <span id="role_document" style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial;"> A new eRumor began circulating in early April 2010 that claims that the new healthcare reform bill includes requirements for every American to have microchips implanted in their bodies that would contain medical and other encoded personal information.  The email message says it may be a form of the &#8220;Mark of the Beast&#8221; indicated in the Bible as one of the signs of the end of the world.  It is not true.</span></p>
<p>It refers to what is called in the health care legislation the &#8220;National Medical Device Registry.&#8221;  The registry does exist in the bill but has nothing to do with requiring implanted microchips in American citizens.  It proposes a national database of medical devices that have already been put into people&#8217;s bodies such as artificial knees, artificial hips, heart stents, pacemakers, etc.  The purpose of the registry is to track the effectiveness and performance of the devices.</p>
<p>Whoever originated this eRumor took the wording from the bill about the medical device registry and added their own interpretation that it involved microchips and would apply to every person.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Individuals and families can opt out of the health care system if they belong to a religious organization that has a health care sharing ministry-<span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span></b><br />
Members of some religious organizations may claim a Religious Conscience Exemption if their sects meet the conditions by having a health care sharing ministry that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a).</p>
<p align="justify">Members of the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientists),  might not object to medical care purchasing health insurance.  The church&#8217;s official websites says that it teaches members that they &#8220;are always free to choose medical treatment, which many individuals feel is the most obvious solution to health difficulties.&#8221;  Members might be free to enroll in the health care plan or opt out of it.</p>

<p align="justify">Such individuals and families will not be subject to the 2.5% tax.  This is outlined on pages 326-328 discuss religious conscience exemptions:</p>

<p align="center"><b>HR-3200 eRumors:</b></p>
<p align="justify">There are many questions being raised about President Obama&#8217;s new proposed health care bill and we will try to answer them.    The bill was introduced to Congress as the &#8220;America&#8217;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009&#8221; or  H.R. 3200 on July 14, 2009.  The Bill was sponsored by Representative  John D. Dingell of the15th district of Michigan.  According to the Thomas Library of Congress the bill was &#8220;referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, Education and Labor, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p align="justify">As  of July 28, 2009, The Thomas Library reports, &#8220;Latest Major Action: 7/21/2009 House committee/subcommittee actions. Status: Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.&#8221;     The status of this bill and text can be found at the Thomas Library by searching the bill number H.R. 3200.  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/">Click</a> for Thomas Library.</p>

<p><b>Mandatory end of life counseling every five years to instruct patients how to determine ways to end suffering- <span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span> &amp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction! To be excluded by the Senate!</span></b></p>
<p align="justify">On August 13, 2009 the Associated Press reported that, &#8220;Key senators are excluding a provision on end-of-life care from health overhaul legislation after language in a House bill caused a furor.&#8221;   <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090813/ap_on_go_co/us_health_care_end_of_life_2"> Click</a> for article</p>
<p align="justify">Betsy McCaughey, a former New York Lt. Governor and conservative health activist, was interviewed on July 16, 2009 on the of former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson.</p>
<p>In the interview she stated that page 425 of the health care bill said that everyone on Social Security &amp; Medicare would have to undergo mandatory counseling every five years to determine ways to end their suffering. The counseling would be more frequent in the case of a terminal illness.</p>
<p>McCaughhey’s comments dovetailed with several statements from critics of the health care legislation who claimed that the same portion of the bill could be used to promote euthanasia.  House minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter said that such concerns were valid.  They are quoted by LifeNews.com as saying, that the measure “could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia, mercy-killing, and physican-assisted suicide because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself.”</p>
<p>The Vice President of AARP, John Rother, disagrees. He said the bill does not, in his view, create a problem of euthanasia. He said that under the bill, Medicare would be required to cover the consultations for the first time but does not mandate that people get end-of-life consultation. He said that any consultation would be with the patient, the doctor or nurse practitioner&#8212;not a government bureaucrat.</p>
<p align="justify"> Pages 424 to 434 in the proposed healthcare bill discusses Advance Care Planning and the mandatory consultation is to discuss end of life services such as hospice care and living wills.  <a href="http://fredthompsonshow.com/premiumstream?dispid=320&amp;headerDest=L3BnL2pzcC9tZWRpYS9mbGFzaHdlbGNvbWUuanNwP3BpZD03NDIzJnBsYXlsaXN0PXRydWUmY2hhcnR0eXBlPTMyMCZwbGF5bGlzdFNpemU9MQ=="> Click</a> for Fred Thompson interview.</p>

<p align="justify">Page 425 of Health Care Bill &#8211; Listen to this interview Fred Thompson&#8217;s Radio Show interviewing Betsy McCaughey (pronounced Mc Coy). Or look it up on www.fredthompsonshow.com, under interviews.</p>
<p>On page 425 it says in black and white that EVERYONE on Social Security, (will include all Senior Citizens and SSI people) will go to MANDATORY counseling every 5 years to learn and to choose from ways to end your suffering (and your life). Health care will be denied based on age. 500 Billion will be cut from Seniors healthcare. The only way for that to happen is to drastically cut health care, the oldest and the sickest will be cut first.</p>
<p>Now, CALL YOUR PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tell them to read page 425 if they don&#8217;t read anything else. Surely they have parents.</p>

<p>Subject: FW: NBC this morning-HEALTHCARE BILL DEADLY CONTENTS!!!</p>
<p>The Devil is truly in the details.</p>
<p>Since most of our elected officials HAVE NOT read the bill, they don&#8217;t<br />
know that all this stuff is in there!</p>
<p>El Jefe</p>
<p>Subject: NBC this morning-HEALTHCARE BILL DEADLY CONTENTS!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not write to your US Senator and Representative, then you will<br />
have no right to complain in the future when these onerous stipulations<br />
impact you and your families.<br />
Subject: Shock to NBC this morning<br />
An Indianapolis doctor&#8217;s letter to Sen. Bayh about the Bill. Dr.<br />
Stephen E. Fraser, practices as an anesthesiologist in<br />
Indianapolis, IN ) Here is a letter he sent to Senator Bayh..<br />
Feel free to copy it and send it around to all other representatives.</p>
<p>Senator Bayh,</p>
<p>As a practicing physician I have major concerns with the health<br />
care bill before Congress. I actually have read the bill and am shocked<br />
by the brazenness of the government&#8217;s proposed involvement in the<br />
patient-physician relationship. The very idea that the government will<br />
dictate and ration patient care is dangerous and certainly not helpful<br />
in<br />
designing a health care system that works for all. Every<br />
physician I work with agrees that we need to fix our health care system,<br />
but the proposed bills currently making their way through congress will<br />
be a disaster if passed.</p>
<p>I ask you respectfully and as a patriotic American to look at<br />
the following troubling lines that I have read in the bill. You cannot<br />
possibly believe that these proposals are in the best interests of the<br />
country and our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Page 22 of the HC Bill: *Mandates that the Govt will audit books<br />
of all employers that self-insure!!</p>
<p>*Page 30 Sec 123 of HC bill: *THERE WILL BE A GOVT COMMITTEE that<br />
decides what treatments/benefits you get.</p>
<p>*Page 29 lines 4-16 in the HC bill: *YOUR HEALTH CARE IS<br />
RATIONED!!!</p>
<p>*Page 42 of HC Bill: *The Health Choices Commissioner will<br />

their families in unions &amp; community organizations: (ACORN).</p>

into public option plan. (NO choice!)</p>
<p>*<br />
Page 126 Lines 22-25: *Employers MUST pay for HC for part-time<br />
employees AND their families. (Employees shouldn&#8217;t get excited about<br />
this as employers will be forced to reduce its work force, benefits, and<br />
wages/salaries to cover such a huge expense.)</p>
<p>*Page 149 Lines 16-24: *ANY Employer with payroll 401k &amp; above<br />

guess so they can &#8216;deduct&#8217; their fees)**</p>
<p>*Page 203 Line 14-15 HC: *&#8221;The tax imposed under this section<br />
shall not be treated as tax.&#8221; (Yes, it really says that!) **( a &#8216;fee&#8217;<br />
instead)** *</p>
<p>*Page 239 Line 14-24 HC Bill: *Govt will reduce physician<br />
services for Medicaid Seniors. (Low-income and the poor are affected.)**</p>
<p>*Page 241 Line 6-8 HC Bill: Doctors: *It doesn&#8217;t matter what<br />
specialty you have trained yourself in &#8212; you will all be paid the same!<br />

even.)**<br />

*Page 494-498: Govt will cover Mental Health Services including<br />
defining, creating, and rationing those services.</p>

<p><b>RUMOR #5:</b></p>
<p>Our Health Care, newly enacted, Highlighted by Page Number<br />
THE CARE BILL HB3200<br />
THIS IS THE 2ND OFFICIAL WHO HAS OUTLINED THESE PARTS OF THE CARE BILL<br />
Judge Kithil of Marble Falls , TX &#8211; HB3200 highlighted pages most egregious<br />
Please read this&#8230;.. especially the reference to pages 58 &amp; 59<br />
JUDGE KITHIL wrote:<br />
** Page 50/section 152: The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally.</p>
<p>** Page 58 and 59: The government will have real-time access to an individual&#8217;s bank account and will have the authority to make electronic fund transfers from those accounts.</p>
<p>** Page 65/section 164: The plan will be subsidized (by the government) for all union members, union retirees and for community organizations (such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now &#8211; ACORN).</p>
<p>** Page 203/line 14-15: The tax imposed under this section will not be treated as a tax. (How could anybody in their right mind come up with that?)</p>
<p>** Page 241 and 253: Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors&#8217; fees.</p>
<p>** Page 272. section 1145: Cancer hospitals will ration care according to the patient&#8217;s age.</p>
<p>** Page 317 and 321: The government will impose a prohibition on hospital expansion; however, communities may petition for an exception.</p>
<p>** Page 425, line 4-12: The government mandates advance-care planning consultations. Those on Social Security will be required to attend an &#8220;end-of-life planning&#8221; seminar every five years. (Death counseling..)</p>
<p>** Page 429, line 13-25: The government will specify which doctors can write an end-of-life order.</p>
<p>HAD ENOUGH???? Judge Kithil then goes on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, it is specifically stated that this bill will not apply to members of Congress. Members of Congress are already exempt from the Social Security system, and have a well-funded private plan that covers their retirement needs. If they were on our Social Security plan, I believe they would find a very quick &#8216;fix&#8217; to make the plan financially sound for their future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Honorable David Kithil<br />
Marble Falls, Texas</p>
<p>All of the above should give you the point blank ammo you need to support your opposition to Obamacare. Please send this information on to all of your email contacts.</p>
