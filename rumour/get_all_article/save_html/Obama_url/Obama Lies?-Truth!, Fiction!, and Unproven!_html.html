<p><b>Summary of eRumor:</b></p>
<p>A lengthy email represented as lies told by Senator Barack Obama.<br />
<b>The Truth:</b></p>
<p>This is a list of alleged &#8220;lies&#8221; by presidential candidate Barack Obama that circulated during the 2008 presidential primary season.</p>
<p>There were several different versions, the first having only about 25 criticisms of Obama and instead of calling him a &#8220;liar&#8221; it ended each claim with the phrase &#8220;Not quite.&#8221;  Then it was 46 questions and a version circulated that added four more to make it 50 lies.</p>

</div></div></div>It was a very difficult and tedious process to research this.   Whoever put it together did not document where Obama made these statements and many of them could not be found.<br />
<b><br />
</b>In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors.  <b> <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/fightthesmearshome/">CLICK HERE </a></b>for the &#8220;Fight the Smears&#8221; page.<b></p>
<p>(<a href="obamalinks.htm">CLICK HERE </a> </b>for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama<b>)</p>
<p></b>Let&#8217;s deal with them one at a time.</p>
<p><b>LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born &#8211; LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 &#8211; Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google &#8216;Obama Selma&#8217; for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)-<span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br />
</span></b>This refers to a speech Obama gave and when he did get the dates of his birth and the events at Selma backwards.</p>
<p>It was in 2007 at a celebration of the famous Selma-to- Montgomery Voting Rights March in Alabama that took place in March, 1965.</p>
<p>At one point in the speech, Obama described how that was the environment in which his father came to the United States and met his mother.  Then he said, &#8220;There was something stirring across the country because of what happened in Selma, Alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge. So they got together and Barack Obama Jr. was born. So don&#8217;t tell me I don&#8217;t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m not coming home to Selma, Alabama.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Selma Voting Rights March was in March, 1965.  Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 so he was not born in the shadow of what happened in Selma.</p>
<p><b>2.) Father Was A Goat Herder &#8211; LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government-<span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span> &amp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction!</span></b><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br />
</span>It is true that Obama&#8217;s father became well-educated and had the advantage in his early life of having learned to read and write.</p>
<p>It is also true, however, that he herded goats.  In his autobiography, <i>Dreams From My Father, </i>Obama describes that his father herded goats for his own father, who was a farmer.  As a youth, Obama&#8217;s father was sent to a missionary school to be educated.  When he returned, according to family members, he could find little work except goat herding in his village of Nyangoma Kogela in Western Kenya.</p>
<p><b>3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter &#8211; LIAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had-</b><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unproven!</span></strong><br />
We could not find this claim that Obama represented his father as a &#8220;proud freedom fighter.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom &#8211; LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya .. It is the first widespread violence in decades-</b><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unproven! </span>&amp; <span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span></strong><br />
Again, we could not find where Obama said that his family has strong ties to African Freedom.</p>
<p>Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya who ran for president in 2007 and challenged the election results when he lost.  The resulting violence killed hundreds and left thousands homeless.  Odinga has claimed to be Obama&#8217;s cousin but Obama has never acknowledged that and no proof of the connection has been offered.</p>
<p><b>5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian &#8211; LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. Not to mention, Christianity wouldn&#8217;t allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction!<br />
</span></b>We could not find a time when Obama claimed that his grandmother had always been a Christian. If he did, the writer of this email described a Moslem woman, which would be Obama&#8217;s grandmother on his father&#8217;s side.  In a speech in 2007, Obama described his maternal grandparents as &#8220;nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>6.) My Name is African Swahili &#8211; LIAR, your name is Arabic and &#8216;Baraka&#8217; (from which Barack came) means &#8216;blessed&#8217; in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama-</b><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction! </span>&amp; <span style="color: #008000;">Truth!</span></strong><br />
There has been a lot of discussion about this one with some people connecting the name to Arabic words, others to Hebrew, and others to Swahili.  Regardless, the name &#8220;Barack&#8221; or &#8220;Barak&#8221; is found among Africans and &#8220;Barak&#8221; is a Swahili word meaning blessing or prosperity.  There are also related Arabic words such as &#8220;baaraka,&#8221; which relates to blessing and most agree that the name is derived from Arabic.  Obama has cited both origins of the name.  In his book <i>Dreams From My Father</i>, Obama describes the name in this way:  &#8220;“It means ‘Blessed.’ In Arabic. My grandfather was a Muslim.”  He has also described his first name as Swahili.</p>
<p><b>Barack Hussein Obama is not half black. If elected, he would be the first Arab-American President, not the first black President. Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother&#8217;s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father&#8217;s side. While Barack Hussein Obama&#8217;s father was from Kenya , his father&#8217;s family was mainly Arabs. Barack Hussein Obama&#8217;s father was only 12.5% African Negro and 87.5% Arab (his father&#8217;s birth certificate even states he&#8217;s Arab, not African Negro).

<p>Obama&#8217;s father&#8217;s family is overwhelmingly African.  According to an overview of published genealogies of Barack Obama:  His father was Barack Obama.  His grandfather was Onyango Obama, a Kenyen who converted to Islam.  His great grandfather was simply known as Obama of Kendu Bay, Kenya.  His second great grandfather was named Obiyo.  His third great grandfather was named Okoth.  His fourth great grandfather was named Obongo.  His fifth great grandfather was named Otondi.  His sixth great grandfather was named Ogelo.  His seventh great grandfather was named Ogelo. <b></p>

</span></b>As a child, Obama attended both Islamic and Christian schools.  In the Islamic school there was education about Islam faith and practice as there was in the Christian school.  There is no evidence that as an adult Obama has ever practiced Islam.</p>
<p>We have dealt with this in detail in a story about Obama&#8217;s faith. <b> <a href="obama.htm">CLICK HERE</a> </b>for that story.</p>

In his book <i>Dreams From My Father, </i>Obama tells of attending both the Islamic and the Christian schools in Indonesia during his childhood. He does describe that one of the teachers from the Islamic school &#8220;wrote to tell my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported on 1/24/08 that when his family moved to Indonesia when he was a child, &#8220;At first, Obama attended the Catholic school, Fransiskus Assisis, where documents showed he enrolled as a Muslim, the religion of his stepfather. The document required that each student choose one of five state-sanctioned religions when registering – Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic or Protestant.&#8221;</p>

</b>As a presidential candidate, Obama certainly argues that he is qualified to deal with foreign policy, but whether that is true or not depends on the observer and is a matter of opinion.  His travels have included more than Africa and the Middle East, however.  He was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and served on several subcommittees.   He was described by his critics as the most traveled freshman Senator.  His travels have included Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan in Asia, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, the Palestinian Territories, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa.<br />

</span></b>Obama&#8217;s autobiography deals extensively with his experience growing up as an African-American and the issues that presented him.  His drug use, he says, was &#8220;&#8230;something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind, something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory.&#8221;  In October, 2006, he told a New York Times reporter that his drug use was &#8220;&#8230;reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teenage boy.  Teenage boys are frequently confused.&#8221;</p>

</span></b>This is with reference to criticism of Obama for having voted &#8220;present&#8221; 130 times during his service in the Illinois legislature instead of &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221;   The &#8220;present&#8221; vote is, in fact, common in the Illinois state legislature and is sometimes at the request of the legislative leaders.  When legislators vote, they use buttons on their desks that register their choices electronically.  A red button is for &#8220;no,&#8221; a green button is for &#8220;yes,&#8221; and a yellow button is for &#8220;present.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>18.) I Was A Professor Of Law &#8211; LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction!<br />
</span></b>The University of Chicago Law School has issued a statement on this:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School&#8217;s Senior Lecturers has high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><b>19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer &#8211; LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Unclear!</span><br />

</span></b>It depends on what the writer of this email was referring to.  We haven&#8217;t found a quote that said &#8220;Without me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill.&#8221;  As an Illinois State Senator, Obama did help pass a major ethics reform bill.  The 110th U.S. Congress passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability act, which drew from provisions in a bill that Senators Obama and Feingold had originally introduced.</p>

</b>Obama has talked of nuclear legislation he pushed in the Illinois legislature.  At a presidential campaign appearance in Iowa in December, 2007, the New York Times quoted him as having said it was &#8220;the only nuclear legislation that I’ve passed.&#8221;  In reality, the bill never did pass.  It died in the Illinois Senate.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, at issue was the concern of citizens about unreported low-level radioactive leaks at nuclear plants.  On the other side was Exelon, the largest nuclear plant operator in the nation and one of the largest campaign contributors to Obama.<br />

</span></b>We haven&#8217;t found the quote &#8220;I have released my state records.&#8221;  On November 14, 2007, an Associated Press article quoted Obama as saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have &#8212; I don&#8217;t maintain &#8212; a file of eight years of work in the state Senate because I didn&#8217;t have the resources available to maintain those kinds of records.&#8221;  Records of state bills and the votes of senators, however, are available from the Illinois state legislature.</p>

</b>In his book, Obama goes into detail about his work as a community organizer and the role that he played in the troubled Altgeld Gardens housing project in Chicago.  It was home for 5,300 African Americans who lived with concerns that they felt the city had not been responsive to.  Among them were a nearby landfill and a sewage treatment plant.  One of the goals was to get the city to remove asbestos from the apartments.  Obama does focus on his role as the organizer.</p>
<p><b>25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America &#8211; LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill.<br />

We haven&#8217;t found the quote &#8220;I passed 26 of my own bills in one year.&#8221;  It is true that he passed 26 bills in his final year as a state senator.<b>  </b> It is also true that he was handed those bills by senate majority leader Emil Jones, Jr., a veteran Democrat who was black, who represented Chicago&#8217;s south side, and is credited with having thrust Obama into prominence.</p>
<p><b>28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA &#8211; LIAR, the Canadian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them-<span style="color: #008000;">Disputed!</span><br />
</b>This arises from an issue in the primary campaign that became known as &#8220;NAFTA-Gate&#8221; and included a volley of charges between the campaigns of Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Obama.</p>
<p>During a debate in Cleveland, Ohio in February, 2008, Obama said that he would renegotiate the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico or else opt out of it.  The next day after the debate, the Canadian Television Network (CTV) ran a story that said that an Obama staff member called Canada&#8217;s ambassador to the U.S. to alert him about what Obama was going to say and to not take it seriously.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign and the Canadian embassy both issued statements denying that any such phone call had taken place.</p>
<p>Then CTV reported that the conversation about NAFTA may have taken place in a Chicago meeting with Canadian officials that included Austan Goolsbee, the senior economic adviser to the Obama campaign and an economics professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>On 3/3/08 The Associated Press reported on a memo that it said had been &#8220;widely distributed&#8221; in the Canadian government that described the meeting as having taken place in February.  The memo said that Goolsbee &#8220;was frank in saying that the primary campaign has been necessarily domestically focused, particularly in the Midwest, and that much of the rhetoric that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy. On NAFTA, Goolsbee suggested, according to the report, that Obama is less about fundamentally changing the agreement and more in favor of strengthening/clarifying language on labor mobility and environment and trying to establish these as more `core&#8217; principles of the agreement.&#8221;  In the same Associated Press article Goolsbee said the memo &#8220;misquoted&#8221; him.  In a later AP article Goolsbee said,  &#8220;In no possible way was I inferring that he [Obama] was going to introduce any policies that you should ignore and he had no intention of enacting.&#8221;</p>
<p>On March 3  <span style="font-family: Arial;">the Canadian embassy in Washington said it &#8220;deeply regrets&#8221; the affair, and that &#8220;there was no intention to convey, in any way&#8221; that Obama was being inconsistent about NAFTA:<br />

In September, 2007, there was a vote in the U.S. Senate on an amendment that designated Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.  It was sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl (Republican, Arizona) and Joe Lieberman (independent, Connecticut).  Obama was on the campaign trail and was not present for the vote.  Hillary Clinton was and voted in favor of it.  In November, 2007, Obama introduced a Senate resolution that said that President Bush did not have authority to use military force against Iran.</p>
<p><b>30.)

</span></b>We have not found the &#8220;I Am Not Acting As President Yet&#8221; quote.</p>
<p>This is referring to the 3/1/08 death of FARC warlord Raul Reyes after a strike by the Colombian army.  His laptop computer was seized and among the documents from the computer that were released by the Colombian government was a 2/28/08 letter from Reyes to his inner circle.  The letter said, &#8220;two gringos&#8221; assured him that &#8220;the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots. Obama will not support &#8216;Plan Colombia&#8217; nor will he sign the TLC (Free Trade Agreement).&#8221;</p>
<p>It has not been revealed who Reyes had spoken with or whether they had the authority to speak for Obama.</p>

</span></b>In 2006 the Democratic National Committee (DNC) decided that only four states would be allowed to hold primaries or caucuses before February 5, 2008: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.  The Florida legislature, however, moved both the Republican and Democratic primaries to a week earlier, January 29.  The DNC voted that Florida was in violation of its rules.  The four states that were allowed the early primaries asked presidential candidates to pledge not to campaign in Florida and both Clinton and Obama agreed not to even though both of their names were still on the Florida ballot.</p>
<p>In January, 2008, the Clinton campaign accused Obama of violating the promise to avoid campaigning in Florida because of television ads that were running on both CNN and MSNBC.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign replied that they were not violating the pledge because they were not targeting Florida.  They were airing national advertisements that they had asked be blacked out in Florida but that the networks had said could not be done.  Obama&#8217;s campaign also said that at that time the only one of the four approved states that had not yet held it primary was South Carolina.  The Obama campaign said that it had consulted with Carol Fowler the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party who said that she did not regard the national ads to be a violation of the pledge to the early states.</p>
<p><b>32.) I Won Michigan &#8211; LIAR, no you didn&#8217;t-<span style="color: #008000;">Truth! </span> &amp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Accident!<br />
</span></b>Obama never seriously claimed to have won in Michigan, where his name wasn&#8217;t even on the ballot.  During a March 8, 2008 interview on the <i>Today </i>show, he did accidentally include Michigan in a short list of states in which he had won.  Supporters said it was a gaffe from a tired candidate.</p>
<p><b>33.) I won Nevada &#8211; LIAR, no you did not-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiction!<br />
</span></b>The delegate count from Nevada was a matter of calculation and was a bit complicated.  As a result, both Clinton and Obama made early claims to have won the majority of the delegates.  In the end, Obama did end up with 13 delegates to Clinton&#8217;s 12.</p>
<p><b>34.) I Want All Votes To Count &#8211; LIAR, you said let the delegates decide</b><strong>&#8211;</strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Unproven!</span></strong><br />
We have not found that Obama advocated letting all delegates decide a candidate for president.  The uncommitted Democratic delegates can make their own decision whom to support.  In Florida, though, if the Democrats were to allow the primary vote to count, each candidate would receive delegates based on what percentage of the votes were cast for him or her.</p>
<p><b>35.) I Want Americans To Decide &#8211; LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Opinion!</span><br />

</b>Alice Palmer held the Illinois senate seat that Obama won in his first election in 1995.  During her final year in office she decided to run for the U.S. Congress, but lost.  She then hastily worked on qualifying for the ballot to retain her spot in the senate and some of her supporters even asked Obama to step aside in her favor.  Obama pressed forward, however, and one if his tactics was to challenge hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions for Alice Palmer and three other candidates.  The result was that none of them had enough qualifying signatures and Obama was alone on the ballot.  Obama said he was operating by the rules and that if the candidates couldn&#8217;t get enough valid signatures, they might not be effective legislators.  Critics, including some Democrats, criticized Obama for playing hardball in an election in which he had said he wanted to &#8220;empower disenfranchised citizens.&#8221;<br />

According to FactCheck.org Obama has not received any money from Political Actions Committees (PAC) in the 2007-2008 presidential campaign.  There were some Clinton ads that accused him of taking PAC money but according to FactCheck.org they referred to funds he received during previous campaigns for the Illinois state senate and the U.S. Senate and before he had made the pledge not to take PAC money.<b></p>

</b>According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama had raised more than $115,000 from &#8220;lobbyists&#8221; as of March 20, 2008.  FactCheck.org quotes Obama&#8217;s campaign as saying this money is all from former lobbyists, not ones that are currently active.  &#8220;Obama does not accept funds from registered federal lobbyists but does accept money from spouses of lobbyists, non-lobbying partners who work for lobbying firms or for law firms that do lobbying, ex-lobbyists, and state lobbyists,&#8221; according to FactCheck.org.</p>

A campaign controversy erupted in March, 2007 when a video appeared on YouTube that attacked Hillary Clinton.  Hundreds of thousands of viewers saw it on YouTube and as a flap developed about where it came from, the Obama campaign denied that it had anything to do with it.  The creator of the video, Phil de Vellis, finally revealed his identity in an article he wrote for <i>The Huffington Post. </i> It turned out that he was an employee of Blue Stage Digital, an Internet strategy firm being used by the Obama campaign.  In his article, de Vellis said that nobody in his company or in the Obama campaign knew that he had made it.  He did it alone on his Mac computer and uploaded it to YouTube.  He resigned from Blue Stage Digital.</p>
<p><b>42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace &#8211; LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Complicated!<br />
</span></b>In 2004 a paralegal from California named Joe Anthony set up a MySpace page in tribute to Barack Obama.  It was unofficial and he volunteered his time to build the page.  After Obama started campaigning for president, Anthony&#8217;s page became a vehicle for the Obama campaign, largely because of the large following it had built.  The campaign started working with Anthony on the page and eventually even had the password so it could make direct improvements.  When MySpace set up a channel to focus on the presidential candidates, the Obama campaign elected to use Anthony&#8217;s page instead of setting up one of its own.  The site became so successful and attracted so many MySpace friends that the Obama campaign felt it should have more control.  That&#8217;s when a dispute arose over what the next step should be.  Anthony said he&#8217;d hand the page over to the campaign if he could get compensated for it.  He proposed a payment of $39,000.  The campaign wasn&#8217;t responsive to that proposal.  MySpace eventually gave control of the page over to the campaign but Anthony was allowed to retain the online network of friends he had assembled for a new unofficial Obama page.<b></p>
<p>43.) I Inspire People With My Words &#8211; LIAR, you inspire people with other people&#8217;s words<br />
</b>We have not found this quote from Obama, but it is probably referring to a flap that developed during the primary campaign when Obama was accused of having borrowed words from Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick during a speech without attributing them.  In an address in Wisconsin on February 16, 2008, Obama said, ”Don’t tell me words don’t matter. &#8216;I have a dream’— just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ — just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ — just words? Just speeches?”  Patrick, during his 2006 campaign for governor, said of his opponent, &#8220;but her dismissive point and I hear it a lot from her staff is that all I have to offer is words, just words. ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident,’ just words? Just words? ‘We have nothing to fear itself.’ Just words? ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’ Just words? ‘I have a dream’&#8211; just words?&#8221;  Patrick, who supported Obama&#8217;s candidacy, issued a statement that said &#8220;Senator Obama and I are longtime friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language.&#8221;</p>

</span></b>Again, this is not a direct quote that we can find, but Obama has introduced or cosponsored several bills that have passed in the senate.  The first federal bill passed with Obama as the primary sponsor was the Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act.  He cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, added three amendments to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which passed in the senate but not the house, cosponsored the Obama, McCaskill bill to provide a safety net for families of wounded military personnel, and several other pieces of legislation.</p>

</b>Obama has consistently opposed the war in Iraq and as a presidential candidate has issued proposals on how he would end the war.  In 2007 he did vote in favor of funding for the war saying that he felt that the troops who are there needed it.</p>
<p><b>46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care &#8211; LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay for the 15,000,000 who don&#8217;t have to buy it.</b><br />
This is a confusing statement.  Obama is in favor of universal health care.  He&#8217;s not a liar for saying so.  The eRumor criticizes how such care will be paid for, but does not deny that Obama supports it.</p>

                </div><p>OBAMA &#8211; A HABITUAL LIAR – WHO NEEDS TO BE MADE TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE&#8230; 46 well-documented lies&#8230;</p>
<p>LIES TOLD by (God help us) the front-runner to be the next President of the United States… Wake up America! This guy says and even writes whatever he needs to say – to become the most powerful man on earth!!</p>
<p>Check out #7 – Obama was a practicing Muslim for 31 years!!!</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born &#8211; LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 &#8211; Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google &#8216;Obama Selma&#8217; for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)</p>
<p>2.) Father Was A Goat Herder &#8211; LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government.</p>
<p>3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter &#8211; LIAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had.</p>
<p>4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom &#8211; LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya .. It is the first widespread violence in decades. .</p>
<p>5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian &#8211; LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. Not to mention, Christianity wouldn&#8217;t allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man.</p>
<p>6.) My Name is African Swahili &#8211; LIAR, your name is Arabic and &#8216;Baraka&#8217; (from which Barack came) means &#8216;blessed&#8217; in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama.</p>
<p>Barack Hussein Obama is not half black. If elected, he would be the first Arab-American President, not the first black President. Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother&#8217;s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father&#8217;s side. While Barack Hussein Obama&#8217;s father was from Kenya , his father&#8217;s family was mainly Arabs. Barack Hussein Obama&#8217;s father was only 12.5% African Negro and 87.5% Arab (his father&#8217;s birth certificate even states he&#8217;s Arab, not African Negro). From&#8230;.and for more&#8230;.go to&#8230;..</p>
<p>http://www.arcadeathome..com/newsboy.phtml?Barack_Hussein_Obama_-_Arab-American,_only_6.25%25_African</p>
<p>7.) I Never Practiced Islam &#8211; LIAR, you practiced it daily at school, where you were registered as a Muslim and kept that faith for 31 years,until your wife made you change, so you could run for office.</p>
<p>8.) My School In Indonesia Was Christian &#8211; LIAR, you were registered as Muslim there and got in trouble in Koranic Studies for making faces (check your own book).</p>
<p>9.) I Was Fluent In Indonesian &#8211; LIAR, not one teacher says you could speak the language.</p>
<p>10.) Because I Lived In Indonesia , I Have More Foreign Experience &#8211; LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn&#8217;t even speak the language. What did you learn, how to study the Koran and watch cartoons.</p>
<p>11.) I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs &#8211; LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies.</p>
<p>12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion &#8211; LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify &#8211; your classmates said you were just fine.</p>
<p>13.)An Ebony Article Moved Me To Run For Office &#8211; LIAR, Ebony has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn&#8217;t, and never did, exist.</p>
<p>14.) A Life Magazine Article Changed My Outlook On Life &#8211; LIAR, Life has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn&#8217;t, and never did, exist.</p>
<p>15.) I Won&#8217;t Run On A National Ticket In &#8217;08 &#8211; LIAR, here you are, despite saying, live on TV, that you would not have enough experience by then, and you are all about having experience first.</p>
<p>16.) Present Votes Are Common In Illinois &#8211; LIAR, they are common for YOU, but not many others have 130 NO VOTES.</p>
<p>17.) Oops, I Misvoted &#8211; LIAR, only when caught by church groups and democrats, did you beg to change your misvote.</p>
<p>18.) I Was A Professor Of Law &#8211; LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE.</p>
<p>19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer &#8211; LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE.</p>
<p>20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill &#8211; LIAR, you didn&#8217;t write it,introduce it, change it, or create it.</p>
<p>21.) The Ethics Bill Was Hard To Pass &#8211; LIAR, it took just 14 days from start to finish.</p>
<p>22.) I Wrote A Tough Nuclear Bill &#8211; LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation &#8211; mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came.</p>
<p>23.) I Have Released My State Records &#8211; LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within.</p>
<p>24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess &#8211; LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens . You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books.</p>
<p>25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America &#8211; LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill.</p>
<p>26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois &#8211; LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part.</p>
<p>27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year &#8211; LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office.</p>
<p>28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA &#8211; LIAR, the Canadian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them.</p>
<p>29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism &#8211; LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel .</p>
<p>30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet &#8211; LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially.</p>
<p>31.) I Didn&#8217;t Run Ads In Florida &#8211; LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks &#8211; and you still lost.</p>
<p>32.) I Won Michigan &#8211; LIAR, no you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>33.) I won Nevada &#8211; LIAR, no you did not.</p>
<p>34.) I Want All Votes To Count &#8211; LIAR, you said let the delegates decide.</p>
<p>35.) I Want Americans To Decide &#8211; LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time.</p>
<p>36.) I passed 900 Bills in the State Senate &#8211; LIAR, you passed 26, most of which you didn&#8217;t write yourself.</p>
<p>37.) My Campaign Was Extorted By A Friend &#8211; LIAR, that friend is threatening to sue if you do not stop saying this. Obama has stopped saying this.</p>
<p>38.) I Believe In Fairness, Not Tactics &#8211; LIAR, you used tactics to eliminate Alice Palmer from running against you.</p>
<p>39.) I Don&#8217;t Take PAC Money &#8211; LIAR, you take loads of it.</p>
<p>40.) I don&#8217;t Have Lobbysists &#8211; LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting.</p>
<p>41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad &#8211; LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoon.</p>
<p>42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace &#8211; LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients.</p>
<p>43.) I Inspire People With My Words &#8211; LIAR, you inspire people with other people&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate &#8211; LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate &#8211; for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities.</p>
<p>45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq &#8211; LIAR, you weren&#8217;t in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date &#8211; AGAIN.</p>
<p>46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care &#8211; LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay for the 15,000,000 who don&#8217;t have to buy it.</p>
