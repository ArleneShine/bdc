</div></div></div></font><font>Many of the theories surrounding the Sandy Hook Elementary School  		shooting are based on personal opinions that cannot be definitively  		proven true or false — so this eRumor remains unproven. </font>
<p align="justify"><font>An official review of state and local law enforcement agencies’  		response to the shooting, however, contradicts the claim that there were  		irregularities in the police response to the situation. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font><font>A 		</font> 		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpcanet.org/site/assets/files/1144/cpca_newtown_report_final.pdf"> 		<font>Connecticut Police Chiefs Association report</font></a><font> found that officers  		made entry to the building less than nine minutes after the first  		emergency call was received at 9:35 a.m. The shooter committed suicide  		within two minutes of officers arriving. </font></font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font>The report continued:  		</font> </p>
<p align="justify"/>
<p align="justify"><font><i><font>State and local police continued to search the building and  		quickly triaged any victims they discovered. A Newtown Officer found a  		critically injured child, since EMS had not been cleared to approach the  		building; the officer scooped up the child and sprinted toward the EMS  		staging area. This is recorded by in-car video at 09:56:16 hours. Soon  		after, officers and troopers found other children and adults in the  		immediate vicinity of the suspect and led them out of the building.  		In-car video shows the wounded and trapped being shuttled out of the  		building from 09:58:39 hours on. This continued until the building was  		emptied.</font></i><font> </font></font> </p>
<p align="justify"/>
<p align="justify"><font>That report states that New Town, Conn., police officers correctly  		prioritized neutralizing the shooter before providing clearance for  		emergency response efforts to proceed. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font>No information is available regarding what time the first media  		broadcast went live from the scene, so it’s impossible to determine what  		phase of the response television viewers first witnessed. Media outlets  		traditionally do not broadcast live footage from active crime scenes  		that involve shooters because it could allow the perpetrator to gain a  		tactical advantage over officers who are responding, or expose viewers  		to gruesome images of victims. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font><font>The claim that New Hampshire Gov. Dan Malloy said he had been spoken  		to about how “something like this may happen” on Dec. 12, 2012, is true,  		according to a 		</font> 		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7m5qIYYNnQ"> 		<font>video</font></a><font> of the press conference.  		</font></font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font>“Earlier today, a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in  		this community,” Malloy said. “The lieutenant governor and I have been  		spoken to in attempt that we might be prepared for something like this  		playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind  		of incident.” </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font>The claim that Robbie Parker, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook  		Elementary School victim Emily Parker, is an actor appears to be based  		on speculation, not credible evidence. </font> </p>

<p align="justify"><font>By Jim Fetzer (with Sofia Smallstorm and Paul Preston)</p>
<p> 		“I have a lot of sources in regards to as to what’s going on with the  		president and the administration and so on, and every one of my sources  		said it was a false flag”&#8211;Paul Preston<br /> 		Sofia Smallstorm, who produced and directed the documentary, “Unraveling  		Sandy Hook”, which many regard as the best video study of the Sandy Hook  		event, recently interviewed a Los Angeles school expert, Paul Preston,  		about Sandy Hook and his knowledge of what had transpired.<br /> 		Governor Malloy had held a press conference that day, explaining that he  		and the Lt. Governor had been “spoken to” that something like this might  		happen, which raised the question, what “something like this”? Did he  		mean he had been told a school shooting massacre would take place? or a  		drill that would be presented as a real event?<br /> 		Remarkably, we now have confirmation from an unexpected source. Paul  		Preston had obtained information from officials in the U.S. Department  		of Education of the Barack Obama administration, who confirmed to him on  		the basis of their own personal knowledge that:<br /> 		(1) it had been a drill;<br /> 		(2) no children had been killed; and,<br /> 		(3) it had been done to promote an anti-gun agenda.<br /> 		Given his background of 41 years in the California public school system  		(from custodian to district superintendent) and having served as a  		teacher, coach, vice-principal and principal before retiring in 2012 as  		the superintendent of two charter schools, I thought what he had to say  		about Sandy Hook deserved widespread dissemination.<br /> 		So when did a two-hour show on Revolution Radio, “False Flags (9/11,  		Sandy Hook and the Boston bombing)” on 30 May 2014, as the third  		segment, I included the second 30-minutes of Sofia’s interview with Paul  		Preston, which is archived on “The Real Deal” and can be heard here.<br /> 		Because Preston is also highly trained in school safety issues and had  		himself organized drills of many kinds, including active-shooter drills,  		what he has to say is especially telling. He has a website of his own at  		www.Agenda21Radio.com, which he created to alert listeners to the perils  		of Agenda 21.</p>
<p> 		Transcription by Jeannon<br /> 		S = Sofia Smallstrom<br /> 		P = Paul Preston<br /> 		S – Welcome back everyone to the Speed of Light on the Pure Momentum  		Network. This is Sofia Smallstorm and we’re listening to a very  		interesting discussion – Paul Preston, school principal, school safety  		consultant, teacher, coach, and superintendent. He has been in the  		California system for 41 years. He is now retired.<br /> 		So Paul, let’s continue. Can we get a little bit into Sandy Hook now and  		what set off your antenna about it?<br /> 		P – Well, you know I’ve been involved in many many situations at schools  		that have been, you know, emergency type situations and was involved  		even to some degree with the Columbine situation in that we had an  		individual who as trying to blow up the school, our school, at the time.  		In a similar fashion to what was a predicted bomb threat that occurred  		at Columbine thee days before the Columbine shooting, and that’s how we  		kind of got in touch with the Columbine people. They got in touch with  		us because it turned out to be a similar neo-Nazi group that was related  		to the Trench Coat Mafia, of all people.<br /> 		And so learning and watching ad seeing all these incidences play out,  		all these school shootings, I took an enormous interest in because we  		were doing a study trying to determine because the neo-Nazis we had been  		working with in our school along the same time of the Columbine incident  		were telling us that there was going to be some big event take place.  		And so our staff, myself, we all wanted to sit down and figure where  		this was all going to and we studied a lot of the Nazi websites and so  		on, and we figured out that yes, something big was going to happen.<br /> 		Well then Columbine happened. So we watched with a lot of intensity and  		under with my own circumstances and also with watching the videos and  		replays of the other active shooter situations, I became sort of a  		specialist in that and applied it to my own active-shooter training that  		I was doing and conducting with my own people.<br /> 		S – Right. And now can we get in to Sandy Hook?<br /> 		P – Well yes. Of all the hundreds of hours that I spent watching these  		scenarios and investigating and reporting on them on my radio show, the  		first thing I noticed when I heard about Sandy Hook when I turned on the  		TV like everybody else …now I have always told everybody when you’re  		seeing these things play out in real time, the best news reporting is  		what’s happening in real time – that day of, you know, the moments that  		are around the incident. But document for yourself what’s going on  		because you’ll never see it again.<br /> 		And the first thing that caught my eye as I was watching everything play  		out was the lack of intensity with which people were moving and that  		really disturbed me. It hit me within the first few minutes, watching  		the video, the helicopters flying around and so on. Things just didn’t  		seem to be right, like I would always understand in an incident command  		system. People weren’t rushing around. People weren’t panicking. They  		ran that one guy off into the woods and then they arrested him. They  		took him away and there was no connectedness to that.<br /> 		I was also wondering why all the emergency equipment wasn’t around the  		school. And I didn’t see any students either and that really bothered  		me.<br /> 		S – So, it was almost like too slow motion for a real event. Not enough  		panic. Not enough chaos. You had mentioned chaos earlier being a part of  		these real situations. And a lot of support people rushing around like  		press and police but not running fast enough, not running with intensity  		and alarm and panic and concern, I think.<br /> 		P – None of that was there.<br /> 		S – Yes. So all right, and then what did you start thinking?<br /> 		P – Well, just within the first 10 or 15 minutes, it just all looked too  		staged to me, and I know about staging these things since I’ve staged a  		number of them. And, like I said, then you stage something there’s a  		complete lack of intensity as you would have in a real scenario when  		there’s panic really taking hold of people and they’re really afraid and  		they’re screaming and yelling and so on.</p>
<p> 		But the one thing that really bothered me was where were the kids.  		You know they had how many hundreds of kids there at the school. I  		didn’t see them.<br /> 		S – Right.<br /> 		P – And there was lack of accounting for them.<br /> 		And right away – and I’ll juxtaposition this with the situation that  		happened in Pennsylvania. You saw the kids right away. I know it’s a  		high school, but you know, you saw the kids right away and you saw their  		plan of evacuation of the school unfolding.<br /> 		Now this is where it really falls apart with Sandy Hook for me. saw…I  		saw no evidence of a real plan of student evacuation taking place. And  		that stuck to my head like crazy when I was in the moments watching this  		whole thing play out in real time.<br /> 		S – That’s very interesting. No evidence of a real plan. Because only  		someone…I mean everybody had their own response to it. Some of us were  		already clued in from previous kinds of situations. All this has got to  		be not what they’re telling us it is. But you come from the industry,  		the business, and you felt that there is… I would say you knew … It  		probably was not even a feeling. It was like, you know, set in stone in  		your head. Where’s the plan? I don’t see the plan playing itself out.  		Right?<br /> 		P – I saw same of your evacuation centers and I saw some of your colored  		tarps on the ground, the colored taps and so on, but even that pretty  		odd because normally if you have the tarps out there…in every active  		shooter situation you have ever see, there’s somebody on the tarp or  		there’s been some help that’s been given to somebody when somebody has  		been wounded, but none of that was even evident. And I don’t see anybody  		trying to rush to anybody’s help at all in a mass casualty situation.<br /> 		See, when you don’t see that…I mean…I’ll go back to the example that I  		have before about the 13 who overdosed. We had people everywhere, and we  		had people everywhere until everybody was safe, which was 35, 40  		minutes, almost an hour. And that was never happening there at Sandy  		Hook. You didn’t see the mass of people doing that.<br /> 		S – Yes, it’s more like the press filled in for that missing element.  		The press sounded more concerned and panicked on TV as they reported but  		the actual participants were not so …And got, you know, long after the  		fact we got the supposed 911 calls, we got various people giving their  		versions of it on television as they got interviewed. But we didn’t see  		it on the ground. And so how long did you watch it for? Over a period of  		days, weeks? And what were </p>
<p> 		P – You know, I make it a study. I study these things intensely, and  		what really, what really put me over the top was the next morning with  		Robbie Parker going out there, and I saw that clip as it happened. And I  		said there’s something really wrong here.<br /> 		And that’s when I started thinking about the …the actors. You can  		actually rent these actors out. In fact that put these things up for  		training all the time.<br /> 		And I just said ‘this is not…first of all, his demeanor was terrible. I  		would never go out…and I know sometimes this happens but…to send a  		parent out to talk to the press in that fashion about the daughter that  		he just lost. None of that seemed to be appropriate. None of it seemed  		to fit. And his behavior with the smiling laughing thing and getting  		into character that you could see. I said ‘ hmmm, I’m not buying this.  		I’m just not buying it.’<br /> 		S – Yes, I know. Very few other people did. So, did you contact anyone?  		Did you speak to anyone? I don’t mean officially but in your own network  		of friends.<br /> 		P – Yes.<br /> 		S – And what were their thoughts.<br /> 		P – Almost everybody was unanimous that it was a false flag.<br /> 		S – And when did you start looking it up on the Internet because I think  		people started posting immediately. You know, they were making YouTubes.  		The community began to express online. So when did you start looking  		into all of that?<br /> 		P – We–a side note to this is that I have a lot of sources in and around  		and in that area. I have a lot of sources in regards to as to what’s  		going on with the president and the administration and so on, and every  		one of my sources said it was a false flag.<br /> 		S – Now these are quasi-official… what kind of sources are these?<br /> 		P – Let me say that there are the sources that are very close to this  		administration who knows what’s going on.<br /> 		S – Really. So they are really like almost insiders then?<br /> 		P – Oh yes.<br /> 		S – And they all….they say it was a false flag because they figured it  		out like you did, or they had actually factual knowledge of such..<br /> 		P – They had factual knowledge of such. That’s part of the plan.<br /> 		S – I see. And so how much were they willing to tell you, and what else  		were they willing to tell you? Anything?<br /> 		P – Oh, they told me quite a bit, and some of it I can’t reveal to you,  		but it fits the narrative of the anti-gun movement and the disarmament  		of America and that’s what the focus was.<br /> 		S – And you realized that that’s part of the broader picture? That’s the  		Agenda 21 society?<br /> 		P – Absolutely.<br /> 		S – So do you want to tell us a little but about that or do you want to  		stick with the Sandy Hook material? I’ll let you decide.<br /> 		P – Well, let’s go ahead with the Sandy Hook material and then we can  		jump into that.<br /> 		S – OK, so we’re past Robbie Parker now, and what about the funerals?  		You must have known then that …Did you have any concept about victims or  		no victims, et cetera?<br /> 		P – Well, that whole thing was pretty shaky. What was really starting to  		filter in in the system and was just confirming what I was already being  		told about these charity sites that had been developed. By the way, they  		were put up the day before the shooting. And I had gotten some screen  		shots, and I had confirmed with my sources. Some of them were thinking  		that it was a very sloppy operation actually.<br /> 		But there were reassurances to me that there really were no victims and  		that everything’s being staged.</p>
<p></font> 		</p>
<p align="justify"><font>And of course the funerals to me…you go and look at the whole funeral  		process. It looked like they were all staged, from the Robbie Parker one  		in Utah, or the Sarah Parker one with the Parker family.<br /> 		And then I started getting information from people that actually had  		attended that funeral who lived in Utah and said that was something very  		funny about it.<br /> 		S – Now I would like to ask you whether your sense is that these are  		real families even, or are they patched together?<br /> 		P – Well, you know, that’s a good question because, you know, the thing  		that rolls around in my head, you know, the actors type of thing, you  		know. You know because you can put families together and these acting  		programs will do that under certain training scenarios. And so, it’s a  		good question. It really is a fair question to ask whether or not they  		were real families.<br /> 		S – And then of course because they continue to speak and organize and  		be called upon to comment, they have to be formed into these family  		groupings over time. And remain grouped like that whether they are truly  		married or not.<br /> 		You know, here’s one thing that I noticed. When you see a couple, if  		they seem really like an odd couple, then that kind of strikes you as  		weird. And I saw that. I saw a very odd coupled-ness with lots of these  		Sandy Hook families. It seemed to me, why would this person marry this  		person and live with them? They’re so totally different. That happens  		sometimes but in this content it really jumped out at me…myself anyway.  		I didn’t know if you noticed that…<br /> 		P – It’ different to say, you know, when you saw them together whether  		they are natural families or not. That’s…I’m suspicious of that. And  		like I say, I’m suspicious because I know that you can put these  		families together, you know, with some of these acting companies out  		there. And that just kind of blends in with what I was already being  		suspicious about.<br /> 		And so, there’s a lot of things that would go into the details of  		examining this. And I’ve see a lot of the pictures and so on, and some  		of the pictures don’t match up, especially the one of the Parkers in the  		White House. And it looks like to me that’s Sarah Parker sitting there  		that’s, you know, supposed to be a victim.<br /> 		S – There’s no Sarah Parker…<br /> 		P – Which one is it…maybe it’s not the Parker…<br /> 		S – Oh, you mean with Obama…<br /> 		P – Yes, right.<br /> 		S – Emily or Madeline …those are the two order sisters, and a lot of  		people felt that that was Emily Parker leaning on Obama.<br /> 		P – Yes, that was Emily Parker…</p>
