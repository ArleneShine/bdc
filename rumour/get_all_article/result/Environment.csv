"Boat Crew Sees Birth of a New Island in South Pacific-Truth! & Outdated!","2016-05-18 14:56:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/boat-crew-sees-birth-new-island-south-pacific/"," Crew aboard the yacht Maiken witnessed the formation of a new island right in the South Pacific. "," Reports of a boat crew witnessing the formation of a new island in the South Pacific are true — but the “new” island has since washed away. The encounter happened in August 2006 while the Maiken was sailing toward Fiji in the South Pacific. The captain of the yacht, Fredrik Fransson, blogged that the crew noticed “somewhat grainy streaks in the water” and thought it might be coming from an old oil dumping. As they sailed on, however, the streaks grew more frequent and fist-sized things were floating in the water: Eventually it became more and more clear to us that it had to be pumice from a volcanic eruption. And then we sailed into a vast, many miles wide, belt of densely packed pumice. We were going by motor due to lack of wind and within seconds Maiken slowed down from seven to one knot. We were so fascinated and busy taking pictures that we plowed a couple of hundred meter into this surreal floating stone field before we realized that we had to turn back. Just as we came out of the stone field and entered reasonably normal water we noticed that there came no cooling water from the engine. Not surprising, really. After cleaning the water filter the Yanmar diesel started again. Thank God! Pictures taken by crew members have since gone viral: #td_uid_1_5856d7c59acfe .td-doubleSlider-2 .td-item1 {   background: url(https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-4.49.47-PM-100x65.png) 0 0 no-repeat;   }   #td_uid_1_5856d7c59acfe .td-doubleSlider-2 .td-item2 {   background: url(https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-4.49.54-PM-100x65.png) 0 0 no-repeat;   }   #td_uid_1_5856d7c59acfe .td-doubleSlider-2 .td-item3 {   background: url(https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-4.50.01-PM-100x65.png) 0 0 no-repeat;   }   #td_uid_1_5856d7c59acfe .td-doubleSlider-2 .td-item4 {   background: url(https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-4.50.09-PM-100x65.png) 0 0 no-repeat;   }   #td_uid_1_5856d7c59acfe .td-doubleSlider-2 .td-item5 {   background: url(https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-4.50.22-PM-100x65.png) 0 0 no-repeat;   } 1 of 5 However, don’t go looking for this new island in the South Pacific. It disappeared almost as quickly as it formed. Discovery magazine reports that landmasses formed by underwater volcanoes are often temporary, and that’s what happened to this “new” island: Meanwhile, volcanologist Scott Bryan of Kingston University in London was gunning for a research expedition to the island before it disappeared. Many new volcanic islands are ephemeral, lasting only months before disappearing again under the sea. “Ultimately, it’s a battle between the frequency and volume of eruptions and the wave action taking it back down to sea level,” says Bryan. The type of material that erupts also affects an island’s life span. True lava forms more enduring structures—like Surtsey in Iceland, which broke through surface waters in 1963 and remains exposed today—while islands of mostly pumice and ash are quickly torn down by the waves. That didn’t bode well for Fransson’s find. When Bryan finally reached the site this February, he found that the new island—originally over a tenth of a mile square—had already nearly washed away. The rotten-egg smell of sulfur dioxide gas hinted that magma was still cooling inside. Although sea conditions were too rough to make landfall, Bryan was able to collect water samples near the volcano for chemical analysis, which is currently under way. By now, he says, a shallow seamount is probably all that remains of the surprise island at Home Reef. So, the legend of the new island in the South Pacific has outlasted the island itself. Still, the story tends to resurface every few years. The story went viral in March 2016, for example, after the U.K.’s Daily Mail published photos taken by the Maiken’s crew without clarifying that they were 10 years old. And an underwater volcano formed another island in the South Pacific near Tonga in 2015. That story, as reported here by ABC News , renewed interest in the story of the Maiken’s crew witnessing the birth of an island in 2006. ","Environment"
"Solar Farm Banned Over Fear It’ll Suck Up the Sun’s Energy-Mostly Fiction!","2015-12-15 13:13:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/solar-farm-banned-over-fear-itll-suck-up-the-suns-energy/"," A town in North Carolina has banned solar farms over fear that they’ll “suck up all the energy from the sun,” according to reports. "," It’s true that a town in North Carolina voted against a solar farm, but supervisors said they did so because it would have been too close to homes and state highway. The rumor that a North Carolina town voted against a solar farm because it would “suck up all the sun’s energy” went viral in December 2015. However, that idea was floated by a citizen during the public comment section of a town board meeting in Woodland — not by elected town officials. A local newspaper, the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald , reported on a group of citizens who spoke at the meeting: Bobby Mann said he watched communities dry up when I-95 came along and warned that would happen to Woodland because of the solar farms. “You’re killing your town,” he said. “All the young people are going to move out.” He said the solar farms would suck up all the energy from the sun and businesses would not come to Woodland. Jane Mann, who who was identified as a retired science teacher, said she feared the solar farms would prevent photosynthesis from occurring because it depends on sunlight: Jane Mann said she is a local native and is concerned about the natural vegetation that makes the community beautiful. She is a retired Northampton science teacher and is concerned that photosynthesis, which depends upon sunlight, would not happen and would keep the vegetation from growing. She said she has observed areas near solar panels where vegetation is brown and dead because it did not receive enough sunlight. She also questioned the high number of cancer deaths in the area, saying no one could tell her that solar panels didn’t cause cancer. “I want to know what’s going to happen,” she said. “I want information. Enough is enough. I don’t see the profit for the town. The original report didn’t provide any quotes from town supervisors about why they had voted against the proposed solar farm, and people across the web assumed that it was because of Bobby Mann’s fear that it would “suck up all the sun’s energy.”  After the story went viral, however, supervisors came forward to explain the real reasons for their decision, the Charlotte Observer reports : Ron Lane, the Woodland councilman, said the town has received profanity-laced voice mails and enraged emails from people around the country. Ultimately, he said, the Strata Solar project was not doomed by irrational fears. The photovoltaic panels were proposed just 50 feet from residential homes, and the project was too close to State Route 258 leading into town. “We’re not opposed to the solar farm itself, just that particular location,” Lane said. “We wanted to make sure they didn’t overtake the town.” And even though the ideas that a solar farm could suck up all the sun’s energy or prevent photosynthesis are clearly wrong — it’s be a mistake to discount similar concerns about the impaact of solar farms on local vegetation. Dr. Alona Armstrong, a faculty fellow in energy at Lancaster Environment Center at Lancaster University in England, wrote that little is known about solar farms’ impact on plants, soil and climate, and more research is needed to develop solar farms that maximize environmental benefits: …We just don’t know enough about what happens to the soil, plants and wildlife in areas where ground mounted (photovoltaics) parks are constructed. The phenomenon is still a new one and rapid development is taking place on the basis of ignorance. But the effect the PV panels have on the local climate and what impact this has on the plants and soil is very important. Soil is the most significant player in storing carbon — containing more than vegetation and the atmosphere combined — and the interaction between soil and plants regulates carbon storage and the release of greenhouse gases. So the expansion of solar parks matter for the carbon cycle, the growth rate of plants, the amount of carbon locked up in the soil, the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and the types of species that can live in the new conditions. Mass use of solar farms over time will increase the areas affected and the scale of the new phenomenon. In conclusion, the ideas that solar farms could suck up all the sun’s energy or prevent photosynthesis are clearly off base. Still, there are valid questions about the impact of solar farms on local vegetation growth and carbon cycles that need to be answered to maximize the potential of solar energy in the future.

"NASA Finds Antarctica is Gaining Ice, Not Losing Ice-Truth!","2015-11-18 10:44:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nasa-finds-antarctica-is-gaining-ice-not-losing-ice/"," NASA has found that Antarctica is gaining more ice than it loses because of global warming or climate change. "," It’s true that NASA has found that overall Antarctica gained more ice than it lost before 2008. NASA released a report in October 2015 that found Antarctica gains enough ice each year to outweigh increased ice losses from thinning glaciers in coastal regions. Using satellite data, NASA found the Antarctic ice sheet had a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice from 1992 to 2011. Between 2003 and 2088, the net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice each year. NASA said that Antarctica’s ice gains were the result of a snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago and continues to add ice to the continent today. Still, NASA scientists cautioned that its findings don’t necessarily disprove theories about global warming and climate change: “We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.”  Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.” Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks. But it might only take a few decades for Antarctica’s growth to reverse, according to Zwally. “If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years — I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.” So, the study does not debunk previous finding about Antarctica’s ice melt. Rather, the team found that the thickening of ice in East Antarctica had offset melting of glaciers in Antarctica’s costal regions. From 1992 to 2008, thickening of ice in the east remained steady at 200 billion tons per year. During that time, ice losses from coastal and western regions of Antarctica increased by 65 billion tons per year. Still, NASA’s findings will have little impact on theories about global warming and climate change. The journal Skeptical Science reported that when it comes to Antarctic ice melt, the difference between land ice and sea ice is often overlooked or misunderstood. Land ice accumulates over thousands of years from snowfall on land, and sea ice forms in water off the coast in the winter and melts in the summer: In Antarctica, sea ice grows quite extensively during winter but nearly completely melts away during the summer. That is where the important difference between Antarctic and Arctic sea ice exists as much of the Arctic’s sea ice lasts all the year round. During the winter months it increases and before decreasing during the summer months, but an ice cover does in fact remain in the North, which includes quite a bit of ice from previous years. Essentially, Arctic sea ice is more important for the earth’s energy balance because when it increasingly melts, more sunlight is absorbed by the oceans whereas Antarctic sea ice normally melts each summer leaving the earth’s energy balance largely unchanged. So, although NASA has found that Antarctica gained ice before 2008, the fact that it gained land ice is an important distinction to make. Sea ice, which melts and freezes in the coastal reasons of Antarctica each year, has the bigger impact on the global climate. The NASA study didn’t contradict previous findings about sea ice melt in the Arctic. ","Environment"
"Two Oceans Meet But Do Not Mix in the Gulf of Alaska-Fiction!","2015-10-14 11:19:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/two-oceans-meet-but-do-not-mix-in-the-gulf-of-alaska/",".gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;} (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Two Oceans Meet But Do Not Mix in the Gulf of Alaska- Fiction! Summary of the eRumor: Photos of the Gulf of Alaska show a clear line in the water where two oceans meet but do not mix. "," These photos do not show a place where two oceans meet but do not mix in the Gulf of Alaska. That claim has been circulating the Internet for years. A photo shows a clear line dividing the Gulf of Alaska into two halves: one dark blue and the other lighter blue. A caption reads, “Place in the Gulf of Alaska where to oceans meet but do not mix. Mind blowing”: That photo does actually show the Gulf of Alaska, and the clear divide in the water is a remarkable phenomenon — but it doesn’t show where two oceans meet but do not mix. The photo was taken on a research cruise in 2007 by UC-Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences Ken Bruland, and it shows what happens when sediment-rich water from glacial valleys flow into open seas, the Alaska Dispatch News reports : Ken Bruland, professor of ocean sciences at University of California-Santa Cruz, was on that cruise. In fact, he was the one who snapped the pic. He said the purpose of the cruise was to examine how huge eddies — slow moving currents — ranging into the hundreds of kilometers in diameter, swirl out from the Alaska coast into the Gulf of Alaska. Those eddies often carry with them huge quantities of glacial sediment thanks to rivers like Alaska’s 286-mile-long Copper River, prized for its salmon and originating from the Copper Glacier far inland. It empties out east of Prince William Sound, carrying with it all that heavy clay and sediment. And with that sediment comes iron. “Glacier rivers in the summertime are like buzzsaws eroding away the mountains there,” Bruland said. “In the process, they lift up all this material — they call it glacial flour — that can be carried out.” Once these glacial rivers pour out into the larger body of water, they’re picked up by ocean currents, moving east to west, and begin to circulate there. This is one of the primary methods that iron — found in the clay and sediment of the glacial runoff — is transported to iron-deprived regions in the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. As for that specific photo, Bruland said that it shows the plume of water pouring out from one of these sediment-rich rivers and meeting with the general ocean water. It’s also a falsehood that these two types of water don’t mix at all, he said. “They do eventually mix, but you do come across these really strong gradients at these specific moments in time,” he said. Such borders are never static, he added, as they move around and disappear altogether, depending on the level of sediment and the whims of the water. The claim that the Gulf of Alaska is a place where two oceans meet isn’t exactly correct, either. The Baltic Sea and the North Sea meet in the Gulf of Alaska — not two oceans. So, the merging oceans theory doesn’t hold water from the start. ","Environment"
"Photos Show the Beautiful “Fly Geyser” in Gerlach, Nevada-Truth!","2015-08-27 11:17:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/photos-show-the-beautiful-fly-geyser-in-gerlach-nevada/"," Photos of a rock formation called the Fly Geyser in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert show one of the world’s most amazing places. "," The Fly Geyser actually exists in Nevada’s Hualapai Valley, near the Black Rock Desert. Nevada’s Fly Geyser was created accidentally during a test drill for geothermal well in 1964. Mineral buildup formed around three geysers at the site have created brightly colored “travertine spouts and terraces,” according to Friends of Black Rock High Rock . Scalding water erupts from the geysers and leaves behind calcium carbonate deposits that have built up into vibrant green, red and yellow formations. Water pools on the flat terraces surrounding the formations, which makes it even more remarkable: A photographer named Warren Willis, who took some of the iconic photos of Fly Geyser, described how he stumbled upon it in an interview with the Weather Channel : About 20 miles northeast of the tiny town of Gerlach, Nev., lies one of the planet’s rarest oddities: a man-made geyser. Only a handful of them have ever been “discovered” – like Oregon’s Old Perpetual and Geyser Park in Soda Springs, Idaho – which makes getting the chance to photograph one of them an opportunity that doesn’t come along every day. That’s what attracted Warren Willis, a 68-year-old retired Navy officer, small business owner and amateur photographer who lives in Las Vegas and specializes in landscape photography, when he stumbled across Nevada’s Fly Geyser on the pages of National Geographic. Willis said the geyser is on private property and fenced off to the public. A security guard stands watch at the gate, and he was allowed to photograph it on two occasions because a group paid a fee to its owners. ","Environment"
"Collecting Rainwater is Illegal in Some States-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-06-04 01:32:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/collecting-rainwater-is-illegal-in-some-states/"," Viral reports that an Oregon man was jailed for collecting rainwater on his rural property have sparked questions about whether it’s illegal to collect rainwater in some states. "," Claims that it’s illegal to collect rainwater in some states are both true and false. Eleven states have passed laws about the collection of rainwater, but that doesn’t necessarily make it illegal in those states. Some states actually offer tax incentives to encourage people to setup their own rainwater collection systems. The topic of illegal rainwater collection first went viral back in 2012 when a man from rural Oregon was sentenced to 30 days in jail for illegally collecting rainwater on this property. The (true) story of 64-year-old Gary Harrington’s jail sentence sparked a lot of questions about rainwater harvesting. Gary Harrington was sentenced to 30 days in jail on nine counts related to the unauthorized use of water, according to an Oregon Water Resources Department statement : “Harrington stored and used water illegally by placing dams across channels on his property and preventing the flow of water out of these artificial reservoirs without obtaining a water right permit. The height of each dam varies; two dams stand about ten feet tall and the third stands about 20 feet tall. The total amount of water collected behind these dams totals about 40 acre feet; enough to fill almost 20 Olympic‐sized swimming pools. These man‐made reservoirs feature boat docks, boats, and were stocked by Harrington with trout and Bluegill for recreational fishing.” The story led many to believe that all rainwater collection in Oregon was illegal, but that’s not the case. The state requires a water rights permit to use public water (including rainfall), but there are exceptions for “collecting precipitation water that gathers on an artificial impervious surface, such as a rooftop or parking lot; in rain barrels.” So, for most people in Oregon, it’s legal to collect and use rainwater. There has been similar misunderstanding about rainwater collection laws in Colorado. Before 2009, Colorado had strict laws that basically made collecting rainwater illegal. But the state later introduced laws that made it legal to use some rooftop rainwater collection systems and to set up rainwater retention basins at new development sites. Other states that have rainwater collection laws on the books include Arizona, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington. But these laws don’t make it illegal to collect rainwater; they outline allowable uses for rainwater and establish tax credits for people who invest in rainwater collection systems. ","Environment"
"Blood Red Waters in Brazil a Sign of Apocalypse-Fiction!","2015-06-01 16:23:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/blood-red-waters-in-brazil-a-sign-of-apocalypse/"," A viral video claims that photos of blood red waters off the shore of Brazil prove that the apocalypse is coming. "," It’s true that the waters off the shores of Brazil turn blood red sometimes, but it’s not a sign of the apocalypse. That rumor started with a video posted at the Christian World News YouTube channel in May 2015. The video, which had nearly 366,000 views, shows images of red waves as a narrator warns that the blood red water is a sign of the coming apocalypse: “A friend sent me some pictures, and I wanted to get this uploaded as soon as a I could. Check this out you guys, blood red waters in Brazil this time. These pictures were taken around the week of April 27 … This is definitely a sign of the times that we are living in right now. The Lord said in Revelation chapter 16, verse four, ‘And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.’ And that is definitely what we are seeing all around the world.” Water off the shore of Brazil turns blood red sometimes because of naturally occurring algae blooms there. The Brazilian Journal of Oceanography reports that the blood red water was first noticed in Brazil in 2001: “Present data indicates that changes in the oceanographic conditions during the passage of a cold front were sufficient to cause the bloom dispersion. In general, the water column stability plays an important role in the red tide formation. (The algae), similar to dinoflagellates, has the ability to swim through the water column and concentrate in the surface waters causing water discoloration. Its behavior has been assumed to consist of an upward phototaxis, followed by downward migration, or dispersal, at night. This ability was clearly shown in the red water described in São Paulo, where data showed that the red water was constrained within a 30 cm thick layer.” Brazil isn’t the only country that reported blood red waters, either. In 2012, photos were taken of blood red waves at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, the Daily Mail reports : “Known as Nocturnal Scintillans or sea sparkle it has no toxic effects but people are still advised to avoid swimming in areas with discoloured water because the algae, which can be high in ammonia, can cause skin irritation.” There have also been reports of rivers turning blood red, too. In 2011, the Jian River in northern China turned blood red because an illegal workshop had dumped red dye into storm water pipes. Since then, other rivers in China have turned blood red due to illegal dumping. And blood actually caused a river to turn bright red in Myjava, Slovakia, in 2013. People initially said it was a sign of the apocalypse, but then it was discovered that a slaughterhouse’s filtering system had malfunctioned and animal blood had been emptied into the river.

"Newspaper Article from 1922 Discusses Arctic Ocean Climate Change-Truth!","2015-04-23 15:21:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/newspaper-article-from-1922-discusses-arctic-ocean-climate-change/"," A newspaper article that appeared in November of 1922 said the Arctic Ocean was getting warmer due to climate change. "," It’s true that newspapers across the country published a story about climate change in the Arctic Ocean in 1922. The article appeared on page 2 of the Washington Post on November 2, 1922, under the headline, “Arctic Ocean Getting Warm; Seals Vanish and Icebergs Melt.” The text of the article reads: “The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft, at Bergen, Norway. “Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers, he declared, all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met with as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm. “Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared. Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts, which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.” The article, which was written by the Associated Press , appeared in scores of newspapers around the country in November of 1922. A researcher named John Lockwood found the article archived at the Library of Congress in 2007. The article was based on a report that appeared in the November 1922 edition of the Monthly Weather Review . The original report says an expedition was sent by the Norwegian Department of Commerce to the Arctic Circle to survey land and to make “oceanographic investigations.” According to excerpts from the report: “Ice conditions were exceptional. In fact, so little ice has never before been noted … This is the farthest north ever reached with modern oceanographic apparatus.” “…It is of interest to note the unusually warm summer in Arctic Norway and the observations of Capt. MartinIngebrigstaen, who has sailed the eastern Arctic for 54 years past. He says that he first noted warmer conditions in 1918, that since that time it has steadily gotten warmer, and that to-day the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of 1868 to 1917.” But does this prove that climate change is a hoax? Not necessarily. People on the other side of the climate change debate argue that the 1922 climate change report is an example of local climate fluctuations that we still see today. A report published by the Global Coral Reef Society said that year-to-year temperature swings can lead to fluctuations of about 1 million square kilometers in ice cover: “These spatial variations have been used by deniers who simply look at changes since 2007, an exceptionally warm year in the Arctic, to suggest that the Arctic is cooling down! In other words they are simply picking ONE point that falls a bit off the trend of ALL the data to deny the long-term trend. “Another good example of this is a recent posting of the newspaper version of a report made in 1922, that there was much less sea ice than normal at a few places in that year. This set of observations from a limited area (Spitzbergen) in one year has been used by deniers to suggest that there are huge natural fluctuations, and to imply that there is no global warming.” ","Environment"
