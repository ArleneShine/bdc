"President Obama Promised Flexibility to Russia-Truth!","2016-12-13 14:21:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-promised-flexibility-russia/"," Amid rumors about Russian hackers meddling in U.S. elections, reports have gone viral from 2012 about President Obama pledging “more flexibility” to Russia. "," It’s true that President Obama told then-Russian President Dmitri A. Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” to negotiate missile defense after the November 2012 election. Despite those assurances, however, Obama was never able to negotiate a European missile defense deal that Russia approved of, and that has contributed to current tensions between the two nations. A hot microphone captured the exchange between Obama and Russia’s former president in March 2012 after the leaders met about a U.S. missile defense system in Europe in South Korea, the New York Times reports: Mr. Obama’s Republican adversaries seized on the comment, which followed a meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev in Seoul, South Korea, where both had struggled to find common ground amid strong objections in Russia to the American plans for a missile defense system based in Europe. As a pool of television journalists gathered for a news conference on the leaders’ meeting, Mr. Obama leaned in to deliver private assurances to Mr. Medvedev. But speaking inadvertently into an open microphone, he offered a frank assessment of the difficulty of reaching a deal — on this or any other subject — in an election year. “On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space,” Mr. Obama could be heard saying to Mr. Medvedev, according a reporter from ABC News, who was traveling with the president. “Yeah, I understand,” the departing Russian president said. “I understand your message about space. Space for you … .” Mr. Obama then elaborated in a portion of the exchange picked up by the cameras: “This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.” “I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir,” Mr. Medvedev said, referring to Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who just won an election to succeed Mr. Medvedev. A video clip of the exchange can be viewed here: The flap was over the Obama administration’s “ European Phased Adaptive Approach” (EPAA) to missile defense in Europe to augment defense “against prospective longer-range ballistic missiles from Iran,” the Brookings Institution reports: Initially, the Russians seemed to see the EPAA as less of a threat than the Bush administration plan that it replaced. The Russians agreed at the end of 2010 to explore a cooperative missile defense arrangement with NATO. In 2011, however, Russian officials attached priority to securing from Washington a “legal guarantee” that U.S. missile defenses would not be directed against Russian strategic ballistic missiles, accompanied by a series of constraints. The Obama administration has offered a political assurance on this but could not agree to a legal guarantee. Republican support for missile defense and op- position to any treaty limits on it would mean that a treaty could not obtain the two-thirds majority necessary for Senate ratification. Moscow nevertheless has held to its insistence. The mix of motives that underlies the Russian approach to missile defense and possible cooperation with NATO is not entirely clear but likely includes: concern that later phases of the EPAA or subsequent developments will threaten Russian strategic ballistic missiles; Ministry of Defense reluctance in principle to engage in a cooperative effort; opposition to U.S. military infrastructure on the territory of countries that joined NATO in or after 1999; and a desire to drive wedges within NATO. Finally, Moscow may be in a holding pattern on missile defense, as it is on nuclear arms control issues, until it sees who wins the November U.S. presidential election. Ultimately, the Obama administration couldn’t secure an agreement for the missile defense shield that satisfied Republicans in Congress and the Kremlin, and the deal stalled. In May 2016, however, the U.S. launched its European missile defense shield (under control of NATO) launched — with staunch opposition from Russia, CNN reports: “From the very outset we kept saying that in the opinion of our experts the deployment of an anti-missile defense poses a threat to Russia,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Tass News Agency. “The question is not whether measures will be taken or not; measures are being taken to maintain Russia’s security at the necessary level.” Russia believes the missile defense system breaches a 1987 agreement it signed with the U.S. In October, at a meeting of the meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club in Russia, Russian President Vladimir accused the U.S. of “lying” about a “hypothetical Iranian threat, which never existed” and called the system “an attempt to destroy the strategic balance.” The 2012 exchange between Obama and Medvedev was trudged up again after widespread reports that hackers working under the direction of Vladimir Putin leaked hacked emails to influence the 2016 election in Donald Trump’s favor. However, Obama was never able to negotiate a European missile defense deal that Russia agreed with, and that has contributed to current tensions between the two countries. While it’s true that Obama promised “more flexibility” to Russians in 2012, that never materialized in a deal Russia approved of. ","Government"
"NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio Headed to Jail for Issuing Fake IDs-Mostly Fiction!","2016-12-08 08:21:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-headed-jail-issuing-fake-ids/"," New York City Mayor Bill De blasio is headed to jail for supplying fake IDs to illegal or undocumented immigrants. "," Reports that NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio is headed to jail for issuing fake IDs to illegal immigrants are false. The rumor appears to have started at the Conservative Daily Post website with a story that appeared under the clickbait headline “NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio Headed to Jail for Supplying Fake IDs” that doesn’t actually back up that claim. Instead, the article argues in favor of voter ID laws and concludes that De Blasio has “problems” with the Trump Administration over a New York law that supposedly supplied “fake” IDs “to illegals” that will now be destroyed to avoid prosecution under a Republican president: Let’s take stock: not only is De Blasio and much of the New York political establishment guilty of potentially thousands of felony counts for issuing these I.D.’s, but they will be guilty of thousands more if they destroy them! A classic catch-22. Not surprisingly, the NYC City Council member who wrote the illegal I.D. law, Carlos Menchaca, has admitted that the law was written to allow for the destruction of the I.D.s (even though allowing that is illegal). “Protecting it from a possible Republican president was just one of the reasons” for the provision to destroy the I.D.’s, Menchaca said. This is a devastating admission by Menchaca [email him], because it provides evidence of intent in any investigation. The new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, “now has all the evidence he needs to charge NYC and its employees with multiple violations of Federal law.” Again, that doesn’t back up the article’s “breaking” claim that De Blasio is “headed to jail.” And the article used a 2013 photo of De Blasio getting arrested for civil disobedience while protesting with a nurses union to further mislead readers. The article refers to New York City’s IDNYC program . DeBlasio launched the initiative, which allows all New Yorkers over the age of 14 to apply for an ID card, in 2015. The card can be used to access city programs and services, and in interactions with police: IDNYC is the new, free identification card for all New York City residents, which gives all of us the opportunity to show who we are—New Yorkers. As a government-issued photo identification card, IDNYC secures the peace of mind and access to City services that come from having recognized identification. IDNYC benefits every city resident, including the most vulnerable communities—the homeless, youth, the elderly, undocumented immigrants, the formerly incarcerated and others who may have difficulty obtaining other government-issued ID. IDNYC cardholders can access services and programs offered by the City as well as by businesses. IDNYC helps enhance public safety, by serving as a recognized ID for interacting with NYPD. It also helps New Yorkers gain access to all City buildings that provide services to the public and is accepted as a form of identification for accessing numerous City programs and services. IDNYC also provides a dynamic series of benefits to cardholders, including a free one-year membership at many of the City’s leading museums, zoos, concert halls, and botanical gardens. The idea that New York City officials could erase or destroy data from the IDNYC program emerged after President-elect Donald Trump won the presidency on a platform that promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants. Fox News reported that New York City officials were considering erasing data over concerns that it would make it easier for the federal government to track down and deport illegal immigrants who registered: Alberto Saldivia got his “IDNYC” card this year after spending 15 years in the country without legal authorization. “It did cause me considerable concern, because they have my information, also the information of my son,” the 53-year-old Mexico native said through an interpreter. But he felt reassured when Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that the city would “absolutely” safeguard cardholders’ identities. De Blasio, a Democrat, said officials would assess whether to delete the personal records, a provision that was built into the program partly over concerns about the possible election of a Republican president such as Trump, whose campaign promises included a vow to deport millions of people in the U.S. illegally. Municipal ID programs began in 2007 in New Haven, Conn., and have expanded to about 10 cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. New York’s program is the most ambitious, with more than 800,000 cardholders, many of them U.S. citizens or legal residents. So claims made in the Conservative Daily Post article are at least grounded in fact. But there’s been no indication that there’s anything criminal about De Blasio’s ID program, and he definitely is not currently “headed to jail” as the article claims. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly fiction. ","Government"
"A General Mattis Christmas Story-Truth!","2016-12-05 09:06:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/general-mattis-christmas-story/"," A commentary making the rounds titled “A General Mattis Christmas Story” tells about how President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to serve as Secretary of Defense, Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis personally filled in for an officer on duty so the officer could spend Christmas Day with his young family. "," “A General Mattis Christmas Story” has been correctly attributed to Dr. Albert C. Pierce, the director of the Center for the Study of Professional Military Ethics at the United States Military Academy. Pierce recounted the “General Mattis Christmas Story” story while introducing Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis before a lecture titled “Ethical Challenges in Contemporary Conflict: The Afghanistan and Iraq Classes” at the United States Naval Academy in the spring of 2006. An archived recording of Pierce’s introduction can be heard here . Peirce’s General Mattis Christmas Story was a retelling of a story told by Gen. Charles Kruliak. Kruliak and his wife made and delivered hundreds of Christmas cookies to Marine guard posts in the Washington-Annapolis-Baltimore area each Christmas. One year, while making a cookie delivery to Quantico, Kruliak asked was surprised to find Mattis filling in for the officer in comamnd: …General Krulak said that General Mattis came in, in a duty uniform with a sword, and General Krulak said, “Jim, what are you doing here on Christmas Day? Why do you have duty?” General Mattis told him that the young officer who was scheduled to have duty on Christmas Day had a family, and General Mattis decided it was better for the young officer to spend Christmas Day with his family, and so he chose to have duty on Christmas Day… The General Mattis Christmas story has been circulating in forum posts and forwarded emails as far back as 2010 — but it resurfaced in 2016 after President-elect Trump announced that he would nominate Mattis to serve as secretary of defense.

"Donald Trump Invested in Carrier Parent Company-Mostly Truth!","2016-12-05 08:20:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-invested-carrier-parent-company/"," Carrier received a so-called government handout under the guise of keeping manufacturing jobs in America because President-elect Donald Trump is invested in Carrier’s parent company. "," Donald Trump had $100,000 to $250,000 invested in Carrier’s parent company, United Technologies Corp., in 2014 — but it’s not clear whether or not he still does. Trump’s investments in Carrier’s parent company became a sticking point after Trump negotiated with the company to prevent the company from moving some American manufacturing jobs to Mexico in exchange for tax incentives. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump promised Carrier’s parent company $7 million in tax breaks in exchange for keeping an undetermined number of jobs at plants in Indiana. It was first reported that the deal would save 2,100 jobs, and then 1,100 jobs, that were threatened, but Forbes reports that the actual number of saved jobs is less because some were white collar jobs that were never in jeopardy: The initial claim for the negotiations that Trump held with Carrier was that 1,100 jobs would be saved. That was already far from the 2,100 jobs supposedly threatened. The full total saved, however, was smaller because 300 of the jobs were white-collar positions that were never going to be relocated. The total number of jobs saved was 800, or about 44 percent of the total 1,800 that would otherwise have been lost. Far from all the jobs were saved, although it still means many people would keep working. But at what cost? Because the $7 million in tax breaks will be paid out over 10 years at a cost of $700,000 per year, the government’s cost for the 800 saved jobs would be $875 per worker per year, Forbes continues, “The sum is ridiculously small when comparing labor rates in Mexico. That isn’t enough money to keep a company in the country because labor in Indiana would still be more expensive”: Former Indiana lieutenant governor John Mutz, who sits on the board of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, told Politico that the driver for the change was more likely fear on the part of Carrier’s parent, United Technologies, that Trump would interfere with part of the $6.7 billion in federal contracts it held. As questions about Trump’s negotiation’s with Carrier’s parent company swirled, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had as much as $250,000 invested in Carrier’s parent company as recently as 2014. However, it’s not clear whether Trump still has investments in United Technologies because those disclosure forms are filed annually: WASHINGTON—President-elect Donald Trump in recent years has had an investment of as much as $250,000 in the parent of the company he pushed to shelve plans to move its Indianapolis factory to Mexico. Mr. Trump in 2014 owned an investment between $100,001 and $250,000 in United Technologies Corp., according to financial disclosure forms filed during the presidential campaign. It couldn’t be learned whether he still had a financial investment in the company because disclosure forms are filed only annually. Mr. Trump’s 2015 disclosure is the most recent one available and was filed in May 2016. The Trump transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment. His 2015 form showed he owned one or more corporate bonds issued by United Technologies. The bond investment, held in a brokerage account through a Deutsche Bank AG unit, paid between $2,501 and $5,000 in interest for the year, the form said, but it valued the investment at between nothing and $1,000. His 2014 financial form for 2014 indicated he held an investment in United Technologies in the same account that paid interest in the same range, with a value between $100,001 and $250,000. It isn’t clear what happened to the investment between 2014 and 2015. Mr. Trump didn’t indicate on the form that he had sold the investment and he didn’t appear to report capital gains for such a sale. So, while it’s true that Trump held a bond investment in Carrier’s parent company that paid out as much as $5,000 as recently as 2014, but it’s not clear whether he still held them at the time of his negotiations with the company.

"25th Amendment Could End Trump Presidency-Truth!","2016-12-01 08:32:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/25th-amendment-end-trump-presidency/"," Congress could use a little known provision of the 25th Amendment to prevent Donald Trump from taking office, or to cut his term in office short, by declaring him “unfit” for the presidency. "," It’s true that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet or Congress could exercise a section of the 25th amendment to declare him unable to discharge his duties and effectively end his presidency. The Hill first reported on the 25th Amendment ending a (then potential) Trump presidency back in August after he appeared to encourage Russian hackers to steal emails from Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state: The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, as a clarification to Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution. The 25th Amendment deals with the succession of the Presidency, especially at a time when the sitting President becomes unable, incapable or unfit to perform the duties of his or her office. It also establishes procedures to fill a vacancy left by the Vice President. It is essentially a safeguard against a president who runs amuck, or who goes insane, or who cannot fulfill his or her duties as commander and chief and leader of the union of 50 states. Specifically, Article II, Section IV of the 25th Amendmen t outlines a process for “a majority of executive departments” or “such other body as Congress” could basically declare the president unfit to hold office: Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. Under that scenario, the president could then submit in writing to Congress that “no inability exists” and “he shall resume the powers and duties of his office” unless “principal officers of the executive department” submit a written declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. Then, Congress would have the last say on the issue: Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office. So, it’s true that Trump’s cabinet or Congress could cut short his time in office by declaring him unfit to discharge his duties. However, claims that the 25th Amendment could prevent a Trump presidency from happening at all seem shaky given that the 25th Amendment refers only to a sitting president, not a president-elect.

"Meet Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump’s Education Secretary-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-11-28 11:54:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/meet-betsy-devos-donald-trumps-education-secretary/"," President-elect Donald Trump selected billionaire Betsy DeVos to serve as Secretary of Education because she donated millions to his campaign, but she has no experience in education and opposes public schools. "," Rumors about Betsy DeVos, President-elect Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, circulating on social media are a combination of truth and fiction. These claims can be traced back to a meme titled “Meet Betsy DeVos” that began circulating after Trump tapped her to serve as Secretary of Education. The meme lists a number of reasons why DeVos is unqualified to hold the post and argues that she was rewarded for donating $9.5 million to Trump’s campaign. We’ll start out by providing a little background. Betsy DeVos is the daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos, the founder of Amway with an estimated net worth of about $5.1 billion. The DeVos family is known for supporting Republican causes. Betsy and her husband “Dick” DeVos have focused their lobbying efforts on education, school choice and opposition to Common Core standards through their Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation . Now we’ll take a look at some of the specific claims made in the ”Meet Betsy DeVos” meme making the rounds on social media. Betsy DeVos Donated $9.5 Million to Trump’s Campaign- Fiction! Betsy DeVos didn’t back Donald Trump during his campaign, and she even went on the record as saying that Trump “does not represent the Republican Party” before the election. However, as the owners of the nation’s largest charter school lobbying organization, the DeVos family spent heavily to influence other races during the 2016 election cycle. The Detroit Free Press reports that the DeVos Family contributed $1.45 million to Republican state lawmakers in Michigan alone over a seven-week period after they backed off a proposal to step up oversight on charter schools in the state. Overall, it’s not clear how much the DeVos family spent in the 2016 election cycle, but claims that Betsy DeVos donated $9.5 million to Trump’s campaign can easily be proven false. Betsy DeVos Doesn’t Have an Education Degree, Has No Classroom Experience- Truth! Calvin College in Michigan issued a release saying that DeVos graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in the college’s “economics group” in 1979 — so it’s true that she doesn’t have formal training in education. And Inside Higher Ed reported the Devos would be “the first education secretary without a substantial background in higher education” to serve in the position. But DeVos has been involved in educational policy for nearly 30 years. She serves as chair of the Alliance for School Choice , the American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes Education Project , all of which advocate for school choice. DeVos is also a board member of the “Christ-centered” Potter’s House School and of the Foundation for Excellence in Education , which was founded by Jeb Bush in 2008. Betsy DeVos Does Not Support Public Education- Disputed! Betsy DeVos has signaled that she supports personal choice and freedom over traditional public education models from a policy standpoint — but the DeVos family has supported public schools in Michigan with donations. A DeVos spokesperson pushing back on claims the DeVos does not support public education told the Detroit News that the DeVos family has quietly helped many underprivileged children in Michigan over the years. But it’s not clear that help has come through support for public education. In an interview with Philanthropy Roundtable , DeVos talked about the failures of “traditional public schools” boosting support for her school choice initiatives across the country, and that seems to be where these claims come from: This confluence of events is forcing people to take note, particularly because of the public’s awareness that traditional public schools are not succeeding. In fact, let’s be clear, in many cases, they are failing. That’s helped people become more open to what were once considered really radical reforms—reforms like vouchers, tax credits, and education savings accounts. … I’m most focused on educational choice. But, thinking more broadly, what we are trying to do is tear down the mindset that assigns students to a school based solely on the zip code of their family’s home. We advocate instead for as much freedom as possible. One long-term trend that’s working in our favor is technology. It seems to me that, in the internet age, the tendency to equate “education” with “specific school buildings” is going to be greatly diminished. Within the right framework of legislation, that freedom will ultimately be healthy for the education of our kids. Given all that, we’re calling this one “disputed.” Betsy DeVos Believes School Teachers Are Overpaid- Unproven! There doesn’t appear to be any record of Betsy DeVos arguing that public school teachers are overpaid, but a non-profit tied to DeVos reached that conclusion in a 2011 study . The American Enterprises Institute and the Heritage Foundation study concludes that, “Public school teachers receive total compensation more than 50 percent greater than that of private sector employees — if you take into account benefits, job security, summer vacations and other factors.” However, it’s not clear that DeVos personally holds that view. In conclusion, claims made in the “Meet Betsy DeVos” meme are true, false, unproven and disputed. ","Government"
"Putin Wants George Soros Dead or Alive-Fiction!","2016-11-22 07:28:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/putin-wants-george-soros-dead-alive/"," Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a bounty for George Soros and wants the billionaire philanthropist “dead or alive.” "," Vladimir Putin and George Soros have a rocky relationship, but there’s no indication that Putin has placed a bounty on Soros. Rumors that Putin wants Soros dead or alive appear to circle back to an August 2016 report that appeared at the fringe website Your News Wire . The report appears under the headline, “Vladimir Putin: George Soros is Wanted ‘Dead or Alive,’” yet there’s no mention of a bounty issued by Putin, or of Russia pursuing criminal charges against Soros, in the body of the article. Also, Your News Wire is not a reputable news source. The site carries a sweeping disclaimer that states the site makes “no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness and accuracy of information” on the site. Still, the false report that Putin has declared Soros a wanted man, “dead or alive,” has since been re-reported on countless fringe websites. Again, none of those reports provide sources to back up those claims. Rather, they often cite unrelated reports that Soros’ anti-communism charities being banned from Russia, and that Soros said Putin was a bigger menace to the European Union than ISIS. And those reports are true, but there’s nothing in them that suggest Putin has placed a bounty on Soros’ head. And Russia has not listed Soros as “wanted” on criminal charges or for extradition with Interpol. Soros’ pro-democracy charities Open Society Foundations (OSF) and Open Society Institute (OSI) were placed a “stop list” of foreign non-government organizations whose activities were deemed “undesirable” by the Russian government in November 2015, according to a press statement : “It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.” Then, in October 2016, Soros accused Putin of “heinous crimes against humanity” in Syria. A statement posted by Soros on one of his sites reads: The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions. It is happening in Syria. It is being perpetrated by the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, in support of his protégé, Bashar al-Assad. Russian planes are bombing the civilian population of Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city, to assist Syrian government forces that are attempting to take control of rebel-held areas of the city. The combined assault has, among other things, killed hundreds of people and wounded over a thousand, put the city’s remaining hospitals out of commission, and deprived the population of drinking water. President Putin is moving aggressively to exploit the three months between now and the January 20 U.S. presidential inauguration, based on a callous political calculation. As the New York Times puts it: “Mr. Putin calculates that the departing President Obama will be unlikely to intervene in the escalating Syrian conflict and a new American president who might consider a tougher policy will not yet be in office. ‘Putin is in a hurry before the American elections,’ said Nikolai V. Petrov, a political scientist in Moscow. ‘The next American president will face a new reality and will be forced to accept it.'” And, earlier in 2016, Soros called Putin a bigger threat to Europe’s existence than ISIS, the Guardian reports . So, it’s clear that Putin and Soros have an icy relationship. But there’s no indication that Putin has placed a bounty on Soros, seeking him “dead or alive.”","Government"
"George W. Bush Deleted 22 Million Emails from Private Server-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-10-31 13:17:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/george-w-bush-deleted-22-million-emails-from-private-server/"," President George W. Bush and/or Vice President Dick Cheney deleted or lost 22 million emails that were sent using a private server during the Bush administration’s first term. "," The Bush administration reported that 22 million emails had been lost during a congressional inquiry in 2007, but the emails were later found to be mislabeled and many have since been released to watchdog groups. Accusations about President George W. Bush’s handling of emails, and his administration’s use of a private server, re-emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign as Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server took center stage. Clinton defenders have pointed to the Bush administration’s use of a private email server, and it’s inability to produce 22 million emails upon request, to argue that the media and congressional Republicans had a double standard in dealing with Clinton’s email issues. The Bush email fiasco was related to the firing of nine federal prosecutors in December 2006. Accusations that the firings were politically motivated led to a series of congressional hearings. In the course of those investigations, lawmakers requested email records and were told by Bush administration officials that millions of email records were not properly archived and had been “effectively deleted.” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and the National Security Archives filed lawsuits claiming that the Bush administration knew as early as 2005 that its lack of an email archiving system violated federal laws requiring that presidential records be persevered. The Clinton administration put in place an Automated Records Management System (ARMS) that “automatically captured, preserved and categorized all email sent through the White House email system” in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the Presidential Records Act. However, the lawsuit alleged , ARMS was deactivated under the Bush administration, which ultimately led to millions of emails being lost: In 2002, the EOP discontinued ARMS and did not replace it with any other system to automatically preserve White House e-mails or to categorize and separately archive FRA and PRA records. CREW’s Complaint sates, “As a result, since 2002, it has been possible for any e-mails housed on the White House servers to be manually deleted by anyone who has access to the servers.” CREW determined that “hundreds of days” of White House e-mails created between March 2003 and October 2005 were missing, amounting to at least five million e-mails that “had been deleted from the servers and were recoverable only on back-up tapes.” (The complaint) concluded that either server malfunction or manual deletion caused the loss of the e-mails. Although OA developed a plan to recover the missing e-mails and both OA and EOP developed a new records management system, “the White House has failed to implement any course of action to either recover the deleted e-mails from existing back-up tapes or implement an appropriate and effective electronic management system. But the Bush administration’s email woes went deeper than first believed. Later, it was revealed that as many as 22 million emails were missing from the official record. The emails were lost, in part, because administration officials used a private server supplied by the Republican National Committee (RNC) and no archiving system was in place, it was reported at the time . In December 2009, however, the Obama administration reported that it had recovered roughly 22 million Bush administration emails dating back to 2003-2005. The emails had been mislabeled, not deleted. A settlement negotiated between CREW and the National Security Archives and the Obama administration, which inherited the lawsuits, allowed for the release of some of the records: The Obama administration has agreed to restore 94 days worth of emails as part of the settlement. Attempting to recover all of the lost data would have been too expensive and placed an undue burden on the new administration. The days that will be selected for email recovery will be based on volume and on external events. CREW notes in its press release: “Documents produced so far show the Bush White House was lying when officials claimed no emails were ever missing. The record now proves incontrovertibly that Bush administration officials deliberately ignored the problem and, in fact, knowingly allowed it to worsen.” Meanwhile, the AP reports that Former Bush White House spokesman Scott Stanzel defends the Bush White House administration. He claims that CREW is creating controversy over nothing. AP quotes him as saying, “The liberal groups CREW and National Security Archive litigate for sport, distort the facts and have consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard IT issues.” In the end, it’s true that Bush administration officials were widely believed to have “lost” 22 million emails. But in 2009, the Obama administration found that the emails had actually been mislabeled and some were released. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction. ","Government"
"Clinton Sent Ambassador Stevens to Benghazi to Retrieve Stinger Missiles-Unproven!","2016-10-18 13:44:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-sent-ambassador-stevens-benghazi-retrieve-stinger-missiles/"," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens to Benghazi to recover anti-aircraft Stinger missiles that  fell into the hands of militants after the State Department illegally supplied them to Libyan rebels. "," Accusations that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens to Benghazi to retrieve U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles that fell into the hands of terrorists are unproven. These rumors, which often appear under the headline “From WikiLeaks — Worse Than Treason,” went viral in October 2016, shortly after the Justice Department dropped charges against Marc Turi, an American private arms dealer who had been accused of selling weapons to Libyan rebels. Despite the headlines, however, these allegations actually aren’t based on emails released by WikiLeaks, they’re based on various media reports over the years. Politico reports that Turi’s lawyers pressured the DOJ to drop the charges by threatening to expose new details about Clinton’s involvement in arming rebels in the lead up to the attack in Benghazi that left Stevens dead: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton’s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi. Government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi’s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants. After charges against Turi were dropped, an older rumor went viral on Facebook that Clinton had dispatched Stevens to Benghazi to buy back U.S. Stinger missiles from an al Qaeda group after the missiles were linked to the downing of a U.S. helicopter: Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn’t arm the missile and the Chinook didn’t explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. That rumor uses a number of accounts citing unnamed sources, so we can’t confirm whether they’re true or false. Still, we’ll provide some background on where different parts of the rumor came from and look at public information that backs up and contradicts some of those claims. Rumor about the actual reason for Stevens being in Libya started with a PJ Media (PJM) report by Roger Simon in May 2013. Citing unnamed whistleblowers, Simon reported that Clinton had sent Stevens to Benghazi to buy back anti-aircraft Stinger missiles that the State Department had secretly supplied to rebels: Stevens’ mission in Benghazi, they will say, was to buy back Stinger missiles from al-Qaeda groups issued to them by the State Department, not by the CIA. Such a mission would usually be a CIA effort, but the intelligence agency had opposed the idea because of the high risk involved in arming “insurgents” with powerful weapons that endanger civilian aircraft. Hillary Clinton still wanted to proceed because, in part, as one of the diplomats said, she wanted “to overthrow Gaddafi on the cheap.” This left Stevens in the position of having to clean up the scandalous enterprise when it became clear that the “insurgents” actually were al-Qaeda – indeed, in the view of one of the diplomats, the same group that attacked the consulate and ended up killing Stevens. And the idea that Clinton and Obama were in a panic to retrieve the Stinger missiles because a serial number taken from an unexploded missile had been linked to a stockpile of U.S. missiles in Qatar was advanced in Kenneth Timmerman’s 2014 book, “ Dark Forces: The Truth About What Happened in Benghazi ”: The investigation took time. Arms were twisted, noses put out of joint. But when the results came back, they were stunning: The Stinger tracked back to a lot that had been signed out by the CIA recently, not during the anti-Soviet ­jihad. Reports of the Stinger reached the highest echelons of the US command in Afghanistan and became a source of intense speculation, but no action. Everyone knew the war was winding down. Revealing that the Taliban had US-made Stingers risked demoralizing coalition troops. Because there were no coalition casualties, government officials made no public announcement of the attack. My sources in the US Special Operations community believe the Stinger fired against the Chinook was part of the same lot the CIA turned over to the ­Qataris in early 2011, weapons Hillary Rodham Clinton’s State Department intended for anti-Khadafy forces in Libya. They believe the Qataris delivered between 50 and 60 of those same Stingers to the Taliban in early 2012, and an additional 200 SA-24 Igla-S surface-to-air missiles. Timmerman cites unnamed sources, and we weren’t able to find any outside reports verify his account of an unexploded missile being linked to the stockpile in Qatar. That part of this rumor remains unproven. But Clinton actually made reference to the fact that Stevens was in Benghazi, at least in part, to secure shoulder-fired missiles that Gadhafi had left behind i n her testimony before the House Committee on Benghazi in October 2015: Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better. A weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time. He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country’s fragile transition to democracy. And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia. He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Gadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands. The nearest Israeli airport is just a day’s drive from the Libyan border. Clinton implied in previous testimony, however, that Stevens had gone to Benghazi on his own accord without guidance from the State Department. During a House Foreign Affairs Committee in January 2013 , Clinton testified that “Chris Stevens did not ask anyone (at the State Department) for permission to go to Benghazi; I don’t think it would have crossed his mind.” There are many, many reports about Stinger missiles in Libya before Gadhafi fell and the U.S. consulate was attacked — so it’s not clear that Stevens was working to secure U.S.-supplied stinger missiles. U.S. Gen. Carter Ham, then serving as head of U.S. Africa Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in April 2011 that, “We do estimate that there were as many as 20,000 of these types of weapons in Libya before the conflict began.” The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that Qaddafi’s regime believed that an outside source was supplying anti-aircraft Stingers to rebel fighters there. Then, in December 2012, the New York Times reported that U.S.-approved arms shipments to Libyan rebels had fallen into the hands of extremists due to lack of oversight. That report, however, indicated that U.S. officials didn’t object to Qatar shipping Russian and French arms to Libya — but officials wouldn’t allow Qatar to ship American weapons. That report also lists the CIA, not the State Department, as overseeing the arming of Libyan rebels: The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats. . . . The Obama administration did not initially raise objections when Qatar began shipping arms to opposition groups in Syria, even if it did not offer encouragement, according to current and former administration officials. But they said the United States has growing concerns that, just as in Libya, the Qataris are equipping some of the wrong militants. The United States, which had only small numbers of C.I.A. officers in Libya during the tumult of the rebellion, provided little oversight of the arms shipments. Within weeks of endorsing Qatar’s plan to send weapons there in spring 2011, the White House began receiving reports that they were going to Islamic militant groups. They were “more antidemocratic, more hard-line, closer to an extreme version of Islam” than the main rebel alliance in Libya, said a former Defense Department official. So, there are credible reports to confirm that the U.S. didn’t disapprove of arms shipments from Qatar to rebels in Benghazi. There are also credible reports that part of Stevens’ mission in Benghazi was to recover anti-aircraft weapons. But claims that Clinton secretly sent Stevens to Benghazi to recover those weapons, or that those weapons were used to shoot down a U.S. helicopter, are based on unnamed sources and cannot be verified.

"Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee “Black Hurricanes Matter” Claims-Truth!","2016-10-06 11:30:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rep-sheila-jackson-lee-black-hurricanes-matter-claims/"," U.S. Rep. Sheilia Jackson, a Democrat from Texas, once argued that the National Weather Service uses hurricane names that are “lily white” and should try to be more racially inclusive with its name selection. "," Reports that Sheila Jackson Lee took issue with the “lily white” names given to hurricanes in 2003 appear to be true — but she never said “Black Hurricanes Matter.” The old rumor resurfaced as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida and parts of the East Coast, prompting widespread evacuations, in early October 2016. Jackson’s comment about the “whiteness” of hurricane names from 2003 was drudged up in a report by CNBC about how hurricanes get their names: Naming conventions are also a source of controversy. A black congresswoman from Texas complained in 2003 that hurricanes were only given white names. “All racial groups should be represented,” she said, CNBC attributed the quote to Wired , which attributed the quote to WND , which attributed the quote to a printed version of The Hill from August 2003. The column doesn’t exist in the Hill’s online archives, but we found an archived version of the original column here : Hurricane Latonya? Hurricane names raise a warning The 2003 hurricane season is here, and that means a whole new list of names such as Larry, Sam and Wanda ready to make tropical-storm history. Although Spanish and French names are included in this year’s lineup, among them Juan and Claudette, which struck Texas last week, popular African American names, like Keisha, Jamal and Deshawn, are nowhere to be found. Some black lawmakers don’t seem to mind, but Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) does. “All racial groups should be represented,” said Lee. The World Meteorological Organization After feminist groups protested, men’s names were added in 1979. The National Weather Service says Atlantic Ocean, where such storms occur. Yet that doesn’t explain why Gaston, Ernesto and Cindy were chosen and Antwon, Destiny and Latonya were passed over. Lee said she hoped in the future the weather establishment “would try to be inclusive of African American names.” That could take a while. The current roster of hurricane names isn’t due to be updated until 2007. Critics of Jackson have often used the column to ridicule her for allegedly inserting race into a subject where it doesn’t seem to belong. That was reflected in 2016 when the tongue-and-cheek phrase, “Black Hurricanes Matter,” went viral — even though Jackson never uttered that phrase on the record. As it turns out, however, this isn’t the first time hurricane naming has been linked to social issues. In the late 1970s, male names were added to the list of hurricanes in response to mounting pressure from feminist groups who took issue with the policy of using all female names, the New York Times reports : Female-only hurricane naming persisted until a growing number of women breaking into meteorology in the mid-1970’s shed light on the inherently sexist practice. Not only were hurricanes referred to as “she” by the media, they were also described using clichés of supposedly feminine behaviors, sometimes “teasing,” or “flirting,” with coastlines. But the push to use male names was met with outrage cloaked in the fear that male names wouldn’t inspire enough caution…. And some people weren’t happy when male names were brought into the fold, either. A Houston Post columnist wrote in 1978 that he was “insulted and offended” that Hurrican had been named “Bob” instead of “Barbara,” continuing: Whoever insisted that a proportionate number of tropical storms must now sprout whiskers certainly couldn’t be from around here … The storm, for better or worse, is a lady. Bob, the first manchild of the National Hurricane Center, marks the first time ever that seafarers must wait to receive a gentleman caller. In the end, rumors that Jackson said that black names needed to be added to hurricane names are true, but it wasn’t the first time hurricane naming was brought into social issues. ","Government"
"United Nations Orders U.S. to Pay Reparations to Black People-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-29 09:49:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/united-nations-orders-u-s-to-pay-reparations-to-black-people/"," The United Nations (UN) has demanded that the United States pay reparations to black Americans. "," It’s true that a report filed by a UN working group suggested that black Americans receive reparations, but the report is non-binding and the UN hasn’t ordered the U.S. to pay reparations. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Decent , a panel of legal rights experts from around the world, drafted the report after going on a fact-finding mission to the United States in early 2016 to explore race relations and social issues. In the report , the working group presents “the current legal, institutional and policy framework, and measures taken to prevent racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, Afrophobia and related intolerance faced by people of African escent in the United States, underscoring positive developments as well as gaps in implementation.” The report concluded that there was “racial bias and disparities in the criminal justice system, mass incarcerations and the tough-on-crime policies that disproportionately impact African-Americans,” as well as a history of “racial terrorism” in the U.S.: “In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.” The working group urged Congress to adopt H.R. 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for Afircan-Americans Act , to establish a commission to examine enslavement and racial discrimination in the U.S. from 1619 to the present: The Working Group urges the United States to consider seriously applying analogous elements contained in the Caribbean Community’s Ten-Point Action Plan on Reparations, which includes a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, an African knowledge programme, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation. In another reference to reparation, the report noted that “the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent.” So, the panel of human rights experts recommended that Congress act to form a commission that could explore reparations for black Americans. But that report wasn’t acted on or reinforced by the UN in any way, so it’s not accurate to say that the UN has demanded that the U.S. pay reparations. ","Government"
"Hillary Clinton Sold Weapons to ISIS-Fiction!","2016-09-27 07:56:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-sold-weapons-isis/"," WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server prove that she pushed weapons to jihadists in Syria that ended up in the hands of ISIS. "," Given that we couldn’t find emails to back up the idea that Hillary Clinton pushed weapons to ISIS, and a Republican senator directly contradicted that claim after visiting Syrians in 2013, we’re calling these rumors fiction. Reports that leaked emails from Hillary Clinton’s email server prove that she sold weapons to ISIS started with an interview that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange gave to Democracy Now in July 2016. When asked why he had created a searchable database of leaked emails from Clinton’s private server, Assange responded: So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails . There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone. Assange’s claim that Clinton had sold or pushed weapons to ISIS was repeated by right-wing websites like The Duran and Political Insider , but those stories link to Assange’s quote from above — not to emails that actually prove that Clinton supplied weapons to ISIS while she served as secretary of state. We sifted through the database of Clinton emails and couldn’t find any that indicated Clinton had pushed weapons to Syrian rebels. News reports indicate that the U.S. did begin providing arms to Syrian rebels in September 2013 — nearly a full year after Clinton had resigned from her post as secretary of state. The Washington Post reported on September 11, 2013, that the CIA had begun to ship light weapons and other munitions into Syria — and members of Congress actually criticized the administration for not doing so earlier: The delays prompted several senior U.S. lawmakers to chide the Obama administration for not moving more quickly to aid the Syrian opposition after promising lethal assistance in June. The criticism has grown louder amid the debate over whether Washington should use military force against the Syrian regime, with some lawmakers withholding support until the administration committed to providing the rebels with more assistance. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has pressed the Obama administration to do more to help the rebels, said he felt embarrassed when he met with Syrians along the Turkish border three weeks ago. “It was humiliating,” he said in an interview Wednesday night. “The president had announced that we would be providing lethal aid, and not a drop of it had begun. They were very short on ammunition, and the weapons had not begun to flow.” …The CIA shipments are to flow through a network of clandestine bases in Turkey and Jordan that were expanded over the past year as the agency sought to help Middle Eastern allies, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, direct weapons to moderate Syrian rebel forces. In June 2016, the New York Times reported that U.S. arms for Syrian rebels pushed through networks in Jordan and Saudi Arabia  had ended up on the black market (and could have ended up in the hands of ISIS) — but, again, those programs started after Clinton’s time as secretary of state: The training program, which in 2013 began directly arming the rebels under the code name Timber Sycamore, is run by the C.I.A. and several Arab intelligence services and aimed at building up forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The United States and Saudi Arabia are the biggest contributors, with the Saudis contributing both weapons and large sums of money, and with C.I.A. paramilitary operatives taking the lead in training the rebels to use Kalashnikovs, mortars, antitank guided missiles and other weapons. The existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its budget. American officials say that the C.I.A. has trained thousands of rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until Russian military forces — launched last year in support of Mr. Assad — compelled them to retreat. So, given that we couldn’t find emails indicating that Clinton had pushed weapons into Syria or to ISIS, and Corker’s account of his meeting with Syrians at the Turkish border contradicts those reports, and Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state doesn’t line up with weapons shipments to Syria, we’re calling this one fiction.

"New Dollar Coins Are Missing “In God We Trust” – Outdated!","2016-09-20 10:17:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/new-dollar-coins-are-missing-in-god-we-trust/"," A forwarded email urges readers to reject new dollar coins that are missing the “In God We Trust” national motto. "," The U.S. Mint mistakenly issued more than 100,000 “godless dollars” in 2007 — it wasn’t a backhanded government effort to remove references to God from currency. Shortly after the coins were minted in 2007, a forwarded email circulated with a picture of the godless coin, and it urged people to refuse to accept all dollar coins in protest: Who originally put ‘In God We Trust’ onto our currency? My bet is that it was one of the Presidents on these coins. All our U.S. Government has done is Dishonor them, and disgust me!!! If ever there was a reason to boycott something, THIS IS IT!!!! DO NOT ACCEPT THE NEW DOLLAR COINS AS CHANGE Together we can force them out of circulation. Nearly 10 years later, the forwarded email still periodically resurfaces. Each time, it leads readers to believe that the government has intentionally removed “In God We Trust” from “new” dollar coins that are being released. However, NBC News and Fox News both reported in March 2007 that edge inscriptions that were supposed to read “In God We Trust,” “E Pluribus Unum” and the mint year were mistakenly left off up to 100,000 George Washington dollar coins. The coins reportedly made it passed inspectors in Philadelphia and went into circulation on February 15, 2007. The U.S. Mint struck 300 million coins with golden coloring that slightly larger thicker than a quarter that year. Naturally, the dollar coins that are missing the “In God We Trust” edge inscription have since become a somewhat valuable to collectors. The first error coin discovered sold for $600 — but the price quickly came down. Today, they have been known to fetch up to $50. NGC Coin Explorer explains that the coins are extremely rare because many of them were held in storage at banks around the country. However, NGC estimates that 250,000 coins were missing the edge inscriptions — more than the initial estimate that 100,000 coins were impacted: George Washington was the first coin of the golden dollar series honoring Presidents of the United States. While the initial fervor of the new series pushed up mintages, the coins didn’t circulate and most are still in storage at banks around the country. The Presidential dollar coin series was the first series the U.S. Mint had produced in decades with edge lettering. The date, mint mark, IN GOD WE TRUST and E PLURIBUS UNUM were all struck into the edge. On the MS coins, this was done as a separate process after the coins were struck. Apparently, an entire bin of perhaps 250,000 coins was mistakenly released without going through this process, leading to a rush on banks with eager collectors hoping to find valuable errors. Most of them seemed to be concentrated around the area of the Federal Reserve bank branch in Jacksonville, FL. Some have speculated that the government intentionally left the “In God We Trust” edge inscription off of the coins in a subtle attempt to remove references to God from U.S. currency. We haven’t been able to find anything to back up that claim. ","Government"
"South Africa President Zuma’s 747 Boeing Airplane-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-16 12:01:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/south-africa-president-zumas-747-boeing-airplane/"," South African President Jacob Zuma plans to purchase a luxury Boeing 747 at a cost of 4 billion rand, or about $280 million, to South African taxpayers "," Reports about President Zuma’s Boeing 747 are a combination of truth and fiction. These rumors started after Zuma’s presidential plane, a Boeing Inkwazi, was grounded in Moscow due to mechanical problems in 2015. Soon after Zuma requested an upgraded presidential plane — and there was plenty of backlash. South Africa’s City Press described the request in a report that stirred outcy: A private bedroom suite, a bathroom and a conference room for eight people on board. These are just some of the specifications for a brand-new presidential jet that Armscor, the defence force’s acquisitions agency, is planning to buy for President Jacob Zuma, which could cost as much as R4 billion. Armscor officially announced the acquisition process on its website on Thursday with a request for information from people who may be able to supply the jet. The deadline is as early as November 20, which means information must be submitted by the time the Armscor acquisitions board meets next month. Secretary for defence Sam Gulube confirmed that the department had asked Armscor to procure a VIP jet for Zuma. He said specific requirements were submitted to his office by the SA air force. “We don’t know how much it’s going to cost. Any talk about cost of such a capability is unfounded, groundless and baseless. Armscor has requested information and will only know [about the cost] once that information is received.” BBC reported in November that opposition parties in South Africa had condemned Zuma’s request. They pushed for a “cheaper, less luxurious option” to shuttle Zuma around the globe: Reports of the intention to buy a multi-million dollar jet for South Africa’s president could not come at a worse time — after huge public protests by students calling for no fees at universities. It is not the first time a new aircraft for President Zuma has been proposed. The last few occasions those plans never came to fruition. So it is unlikely that the state will go ahead with the procurement against the current barrage of condemnation. The timing is just not right. “A four-billion rand luxury VIP jet fitted with a private bedroom suite‚ a bathroom and conference room for eight and 30-person capacity is not the answer,” said (a Democratic Alliance spokesperson). That wasn’t the end of the story, however. Zuma was stranded by mechanical problems yet again in February 2016. This time he was grounded in the war-torn country of Burundi, South African media report : The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) said it chartered a plane to Bujumbura from Waterkloof Air Force Base in the early hours of yesterday morning to fetch the president who returned home on Saturday, but only after deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was forced to step in for Zuma on several local engagements. SANDF officials said the presidential plane was jeopardizing Zuma’s security and reissued calls for a new, upgraded presidential jet. Posts and forwarded emails about Zuma’s latest request went viral — and that’s where this rumor jumps the rails from “truth” to “fiction.” These posts and emails seem to stretch the truth in some areas for dramatic effect. A Boeing 747 normally holds about 400 passengers — not 600, as these posts and emails claim. Also, photos claim to show the interior of the Boeing 747 requested by Zuma — but the photos actually show the interior of a Boeing 747-8 private jumbo jet , which costs nearly $800 million. That’s far more than the $280 million price tag on the jet requested by Zuma And it should be noted that Zuma had apparently ditched his request for a new presidential play by July 2016. Business Tech reported that Zuma had opted for a rental plane at cost of 2 million rand per month (about $140,000). ","Government"

However, federal law has exempts “small arms ammunition and components thereof.” The controversy started in June 2013 when the ATF stated in a newsletter that the small arms exemption for nitrocellulose under federal explosives laws should only extend to small arms ammunition that is small than .50 caliber: In general, firearms ammunition is an “explosive” because it typically contains smokeless powder and other explosive materials. However, 18 U.S.C. §845 generally exempts small arms ammunition and components thereof from the provisions of 18 U.S.C., Chapter 40. ATF has long held that the term “small arms ammunition” pertains to .50 caliber or smaller rifle or handgun ammunition, as well as certain shotgun ammunition. Further, under 27 CFR 555.11, ATF has defined “ammunition” in part, as “small arms ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or smokeless propellants designed for use in small arms…” Accordingly, .50 caliber or smaller rifle ammunition containing only smokeless powder, primers, and other items specifically listed as components of small arms ammunition, is exempt from the Federal explosives laws and regulations. Then, in a newsletter released in June 2016 , the ATF stated that it had recently fielded questions about the status of nitrocellulose under federal explosives laws and regulations, and it explained: “Nitrocellulose explosive” is on ATF’s List of Explosive Materials. ATF has determined that nitrocellulose containing greater than 12.6 percent nitrogen is a high explosive under 27 CFR, Part 555 (nitrocellulose containing 12.6 percent or less nitrogen is generally not an explosive material under Part 555). Therefore, it must be stored in a type 1 or type 2 magazine. We are aware that the U.S. Department of Transportation may assign a nonexplosive classification to nitrocellulose when it has been wetted with water or alcohol. This is based, in part, on the diminished likelihood of explosion in a transportation accident. Because the nitrocellulose retains its explosive characteristics when the water or alcohol is removed, the wetted nitrocellulose remains a nitrocellulose explosive, subject to the licensing, safety and security requirements of the Federal explosives regulations. However, based upon the diminished likelihood of wetted nitrocellulose exploding, ATF will consider variance requests to store the wetted material under an alternative arrangement. The blog site Ammo Land explains what the impact of ATF’s classification of nitrocellulose as highly explosive would have had on the gun industry as such: Manufacturers and importers of smokeless propellant have relied on ATF private letter rulings issued prior to 2016 stating that nitrocellulose wetted with water not less than 25 percent by mass is not subject to regulation under the federal explosives laws. Accordingly, the manufacturers have set up their logistics, storage and operations consistent with nitrocellulose not being regulated as an explosive. Manufacturers and importers may not have adequate storage facilities or record keeping systems to comply with the law. Licensed manufacturers also rely on private, unlicensed vendors to store wetted nitrocellulose in facilities that do not comply with storage requirements. A number of manufacturers also report an adverse impact on their contracts to supply smokeless propellant and finished rounds of ammunition to the Department of Defense The ATF’s announcement sparked concerns that the price of ammo would skyrocket as manufacturers scramble to comply with new storage and transport regulations for nitrocellulose, or that availability of ammo would plummet. Some called the move “a backdoor ammo ban” by the Obama administration. Amid the backlash, the ATF announced on August 31st that it had rescinded its reclassification of nitrocellulose after hearing concerns from those in the gun industry, according to an addendum : ATF’s June 2016 Explosives Industry Newsletter included a brief discussion of Nitrocellulose, and attempted to clarify the circumstances under which wetted Nitrocellulose is considered a high explosive under 27 CFR, Part 555. As with all explosives, ATF’s focus is on the potential public safety risks associated with materials that can be misused or diverted to unlawful purposes. Subsequent contact from industry members who import, transport, store or employ wetted Nitrocellulose in the production of ammunition, however, has brought to our attention issues that were not fully addressed in the Newsletter and require further consultation and consideration with the industry. Accordingly, ATF has and will conduct further industry outreach concerning wetted Nitrocellulose. In the interim, previously authorized industry practices concerning wetted Nitrocellulose will not be affected. It’s not clear whether the ATF will continue to pursue new regulations on the use of nitrocellulose in making gun ammo. For now, at least, the effort is on hold. ","Government"
"Paul LePage: Hungry Kids Grow Up to Be Better Workers-Fiction!","2016-08-29 10:48:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/paul-lepage-hungry-kids-grow-better-workers/"," Maine Governor Paul LePage, who has frequently been at odds with the federal government over food stamp programs, once said, “hungry kids grow up to be better workers.” "," Paul LePage didn’t say that hungry kids grow up to be better workers. That rumor came from Newslo , a hybrid website that publishes satirical stories that are rooted in truth, in December 2015. Each story has “show facts” and “hide facts” buttons that allow readers to highlight which parts are true, and which parts are satirical. The format commonly causes confusion about whether the stories are true or not. The story in question , which appeared under the headline, “Paul LePage: Hungry Kids Grow up to Be Better Works, Food Stamps Make them Fat and Lazy,” quoted LePage as saying: “What blows my mind each time when I’m asked this same question is the fact that nobody out there seems to get one simple fact. When you give something to someone for free, it’s not likely they will value your gift. In other words, there is no way that people will want to work more when you give them free food. In fact, there’s a greater chance that they’ll just continue bitching and complaining about being poor as usual, only now they’re going to be doing it with a full stomach. Do you see the difference? Because I certainly do.” The governor of Maine went on to say that “the worst possible thing to do for a homeless poor person is to offer them a free meal and warm bed,” arguing that “that will only encourage them to feel sorry for themselves and cry over their sad destiny.” He also added that “it would be more merciful to simply take a gun and put them out of their misery.” “If you’re really keen on helping poor people, which is something I am very sympathetic with,” LePage also said, “you’d be better off calling them names and insulting them, but only as a way of motivating and forcing them to snap out of their feelings of worthlessness. The story was shared more than 20,000 times on social media sites and made it’s way to mom blogs and discussion threads where it was frequently (and wrongly) reported to be an accurate story. In reality, at the time the Newslo story appeared, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was facing federal sanctions because its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka food stamps) failed to meet minimum requirements. A December 7th letter from the USDA , which manages SNAP, to Maine state officials states, “The State’s chronically poor performance in timeliness is in direct conflict with the application processing statutory and regulatory provisions meant to protect low-income household’s right to receive nutrition assistance benefits in a timely manner.” So, Maine had drawn scrutiny for the poor performance of its SNAP programs around the time that the Newslo story appeared. However, LePage never said “hungry kids grow up to be better workers.” ","Government"
"Mutation Response Vehicles Spotted in Florida-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-08-18 14:07:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mutation-response-vehicles-spotted-florida/"," A fleet of mutation response vehicles spotted near Longwood, Florida, has stirred speculation about sinister motives. "," The mutation response vehicles spotted in Florida are real — but they’re not associated with a government agency or coordinated emergency response efforts. Videos and photos of the vehicles quickly made their way around Facebook and YouTube after they were spotted in Florida, just outside of Orlando, on August 17th. Some speculated the vehicles were part of the government’s response to Zika — or worse, a sign of a pending zombie apocalypse. Luckily, that’s not the case. Rather, the mutation response vehicles are owned and operated by Pathogen Trackers, a group that provides food, shelter and shade to people at the Burning Man festival outside Las Vegas. Pathogen Trackers explains on its website that it serves the “inhabitants of Black Rock City” — which is the name of the group that organizes Burning Man each year: Our Mutation Response Vehicles aid in our benevolent mission and serve as a base of operations so that we may help replenish the spirit and quelch the hunger of others. From the top of MRV-1, passersby are welcome aloft to gain a perspective on all that surrounds them. MRV-2 is a secure, sanitary facility committed to the preparation of healthy meals. MRV-3 is outfitted to provide decontamination of both camp members and winners of the daily Wheel of Decontamination contest. Collectively, the themed MRV and MSV units span over 160′ from end to end, and create a visually interesting and interactive street scape. During the day our massive, customized MRV units serve as a needed landmark and a graphic art exhibition for the passers by. At night, they illuminate fully to again help weary travelers find their way home. Even our well-lit, Chilled Hydration Station and 50′ Pathogen Tacking Antenna serve as beacons on the corners our camp. Photos of these mutation response vehicles posted at Pathogen Trackers’ website match those seen in the photos from Florida. However, the mutation response vehicles look much less sinister when they’re lit up with bright neon lights at Burning Man. “Mutant vehicles” are an important part of the Burning Man culture. Black Rock City explains that a Mutant Vehicle ( which must be licensed by Black Rock City’s Dept. of Mutant Vehicles to enter) is “a specific variety” of art car: A Mutant Vehicle is an art car classification specifically created for use at Black Rock City. The classification was created because the term “art car” can have a broad definition, and, because of the limit on the number of vehicles the DMV can license, the DMV did not want to deem whether or not someone’s creation was “art”. Mutant Vehicles are integral to the culture and community at Burning Man. They contribute to the surreal, visual quality that binds Black Rock City together. That should put any concerns about the mutant response vehicles responding to a zombie apocalypse or mutated forms of Zika virus. ","Government"

"," Edward Snowden has not been found dead by his girlfriend. Snowden death reports quickly went viral after a “coded” tweet sent by Snowden on August 5th led some to speculate that he’d been murdered. Snowden’s attorney quickly released a statement clarifying that Snowden was “alive and well.” Still, rumors that Snowden had been found dead in Russia persisted. Those rumors were largely fueled by Get off the BS, a fringe website that publishes a combination of news, satire and commentary from a right-wing point of view. The site published a story under the headline “Mistress of Edward Snowden Pronounces Snowden Dead in Russia” that begins: Late Monday afternoon, the mistress of the infamous Edward Snowden announced the death of Snowden, who was allegedly killed this past Saturday by a drunken knife wielding Buryat man in the Republic of Buryatia. MKRU News (Russia) reported this past Saturday that a drunken man who for some reason took exception to a man, presumably Snowden, saving his wife from drowning, attacked a woman by slicing her neck and stabbed her male companion in the thigh, who later died from severe blood loss in a local hospital. But the MKRU News story that Get off the BS links to makes no mention of Edward Snowden’s death. The story is about a Buryatia local who was arrested after attacking a group of young people at a lake with a knife. MKRU News didn’t report Snowden’s death anywhere else on the site, either. Disclose.tv , a website based in Germany that publishes articles written by its community of readers “as is” with no fact checking or editing, fueled rumors of Snowden’s death by picking up the story. That version was quickly shared thousands of times on social media. But in its disclaimer , the site states that, “All posts and media uploads on Disclose.tv are the expressed opinion of the contributing member and are in no way representative or endorsed by the owners or employees of Disclose.tv.” That means the site doesn’t trust articles written by its contributors — and neither should you. There’s not truth to reports that Edward Snowden was found dead in Russia — and Snowden’s attorney has directly dispelled those rumors as well. ","Government"
"Clinton Researcher Victor Thorn Found Dead-Truth!","2016-08-08 13:22:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-researcher-victor-thorn-found-dead/"," Prolific Clinton researcher Victor Thorn (also known as Scott Robert Makufka) has been found dead. "," Clinton researcher Victor Thorn, whose birth name was Scott Robert Makufka, died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on August 1st, according to his family. Victor Thorn regularly published books and articles that were critical of Bill and Hillary Clinton, including “ Hillary (And Bill ),” a three-part trilogy that includes “The Sex Volume,” “The Drugs Volume,” and “The Murder Volume,” which tells of political operatives, allies and enemies of the Clintons who have died under (supposedly) suspicious circumstances over the years. That led right-wing websites to imply that Victor Thorn had himself been the victim of a Clinton death plan days after Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination. However, there’s currently no evidence to support that claim. American Free Press , a website that regularly published Victor Thorn bylines, first reported the Clinton researcher and author’s death on August 1st. Thorn died “at the top of a mountain near his home, the apparent victim of a gunshot wound” on his 54th birthday, the website reported. Thorn’s family said there was no evidence of foul play, and he most likely took his own life. In an appearance on the American Free Press podcast , Victor Thorn’s brother, William J. Makufka, choked up while talking about the life and death of his brother. When asked how he explained the timing of Thorn’s death, his brother responded: He absolutely did not like dealing with death and sickness … Scott did not want to get old. He was, and we still are and right now, watching my parents who are in their early 80s go through a lot of health issues. I’m sure that played a part. It is also my true belief that Scott very much believed that death isn’t the end and we continue on … He truly believed his journey was done and he wanted to see what came next. So, reports that Clinton researcher and author Victor Thorn was found dead on the morning of August 1st are true. But his family has disputes the idea that a sinister plot or foul play involved.

"Seattle Employees Ask for Reduced Hours-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-08-01 14:25:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/seattle-employees-ask-for-reduced-hours/"," Seattle employees asked employers to reduce their hours after the city council approved a $15 minimum wage to make sure they would still qualify for government assistance. "," Claims that employees in Seattle have asked for reduced hours to make sure they’ll still qualify for government assistance after the city approved a $15 minimum wage are true. However, it’s not clear how often that happens, so claims that this a growing trend or widespread issue are misleading. In 2014, the Seattle City Council approved legislation that phases in a $15 minimum wage in the city. After mandatory wage increases in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (depending on company size), all workers in Seattle will earn at least $15 per hour by 2018. The law has sparked nationwide debate about the impact a $15 minimum wage would have on job creation, unemployment and government assistance. A report by KIRO 7 in Washington about Seattle employees asking for reduced hours has been opponents of the $15 minimum wage to argue against the law. Nora Gibson, the executive director of eldercare non-profit Full Life Care and a board member of the Seattle Housing Authority, told KIRO 7 in June 2015 that “anecdotally, some people feared they would lose their subsidized units but still not be able to afford market-rate rents” and had asked for their hours to be cut as a result: For example, she said last week, five employees at one of her organization’s 24-hour care facilities for Alzheimer’s patients asked to reduce their hours in order to remain eligible for subsidies. They now earn at least $13 an hour, after they increased wages at all levels in April, Gibson said. “This has nothing to do with people’s willingness to work, or how hard people work. It has to do with being caught in a very complex situation where they have to balance everything they can pull together to pull together a stable, successful life,” Gibson said. Gibson said she fully supports a minimum wage increase but was not surprised when her employees asked for fewer hours. “The jump from subsidized housing to market rate in Seattle is huge,” she said. KIRO 7 quotes a woman in the report who says she’d be unable to afford market-rate housing in Seattle without a housing voucher — despite a $15 minimum wage — because of additional expenses like childcare that come along with full-time work: Justine Decker, who is a full-time student at Seattle Central College, said she works part-time so she can still get subsidies for rent and child care. “A one-bedroom can cost upward of $1,200. And so imagine paying that, and paying child care which can be $900 something dollars,” Decker said. She said she doesn’t want to work full time, or she wouldn’t be able to afford market-rate rents. Decker said she’s in school to become a teacher and hopes to eventually become a principal, to make well over minimum wage levels to be able to pay for everything on her own. It’s not clear how commonly workers decline to work full-time because they fear losing government assistance as a result of higher incomes. However, a Washington State University study published in April 2016 found that many workers in Seattle had concerns about the impact of higher wages on government assistance. Jacob Vigdor, a co-author of the study, said: “Today’s report documents both the hopes and fears that workers and business managers expressed as Seattle began its initiative to raise the minimum wage,” said Vigdor. “Business owners are hopeful that small changes to their operation — such as small price increases — will keep them in the black.” “Workers are hopeful about the promise of greater income, but harbor few illusions about the potential for price increases, or reductions in government benefits, to eat away at these gains.” So, in conclusion, it’s true that there are confirmed cases of Seattle workers asking to have their hours reduced — but it’s not clear how often that happens, which has led to some misleading claims.

"Michelle Obama: Slaves Built the White House-Mostly Truth!","2016-07-27 13:25:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama-slaves-built-white-house/"," During her speech at the Democratic National Convention, First Lady Michelle Obama said that slaves built the White House. "," Michelle Obama’s claim that slaves built the White House is true. During her speech on the opening night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama was discussing the significance of Hillary Clinton becoming the first female presidential nominee for a major political party when she said: That is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to this stage tonight, the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. Michelle Obama’s speech immediately sparked a national debate about whether or not slaves built the White House, and, if so, what significance that carries. The White House Historical Association confirmed that slaves did in fact build the White House after efforts to recruit laborers from Europe to build the White House and other public buildings in Washington, D.C., fell short in 1792: Construction on the President’s House began in 1792 in Washington, D.C., a new capital situated in sparsely settled region far from a major population center. The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states-Virginia and Maryland-ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American—enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings. Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government’s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President’s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations. The White House Historical Association went one step further and posted a payroll to slaveowners that “shows the government did not own slaves, but it did hire them from their masters” to build the White House: Of course, the original “president’s house” didn’t stand long. British invaders took control of Washington, D.C., for 26 hours in 1814 and burned down nearly all of the public buildings there, including the original White House. Remains of the fire that destroyed the original president’s house, as it was called, can still be seen today, the White House Historical Association reports : After a night and a day of torching nearly all of the public buildings, and even a few private businesses, including ropewalks, which sent billowing clouds of choking black smoke over the capital, the British withdrew to their ships, afraid that their path of retreat might by blocked by American troops. The occupation of Washington by British troops lasted about twenty-six hours, but evidence of their vandalism survives to this day. Some of the blocks of Virginia sandstone that make up the original walls of the White House are clearly defaced with black scorch marks. They are the indelible strains from the fires of 1814. President James Madison immediately set out to rebuild the White House exactly as it was, and he hired the original architect, James Hoban, to oversee its reconstruction from 1814-1817, the White House Museum reports : When restoration was completed in 1817 under President James Monroe, it was furnished in fashionable style, some of which remains today in the Blue Room. He ordered a suite of French mahogany furniture through the American firm Russell and La Farge, with offices in Le Havre, France. However, the firm shipped gilded furniture instead, asserting that “mahogany is not generally admitted into the furniture of a Salon, even at private gentlemen’s houses.” Eight pieces of the original suite can be seen, including a bergère, an armchair with enclosed sides. A gilded bronze clock also remains. A few walls survived, but the White House had to be otherwise completely rebuilt. It’s often said that the White House was painted white after the fire to hide the scorch marks. We weren’t able to track down on any information about whether or not slaves were involved in the rebuilding of the White House. But, as Michelle Obama said, slaves were definitely involved in building the original White House. That’s why we’re classifying this one “mostly true.” ","Government"

"Doe Run Lead Plant Closing Is Backdoor Gun Control-Fiction!","2016-07-21 10:50:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doe-run-lead-plant-closing-backdoor-gun-control/"," The Obama White House has taken a “backdoor” approach to gun control by having the EPA close the Doe Run Lead plant in Missouri, which means that all lead bullets will have to be imported from overseas. "," Rumors that President Obama forced the Doe Run Company to cease lead smelting operations through EPA regulations in a “back door” gun control effort are false. The rumors began circulating in 2013, shortly after the Doe Run Company announced that it was closing its primary lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri. The company announced that it had decided to close the smelter in response to EPA regulations: In 2010, Doe Run reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Missouri. As part of that settlement, the Company agreed to discontinue its smelting operations in Herculaneum by the end of 2013. Over the operating life of the smelter, the Company spent millions of dollars in environmental and other upgrades. Continuing to upgrade the aging smelter to attempt to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations imposed on primary lead smelters was not economically feasible given the many other requirements of our business. The company said in the same statement that 80 percent of lead produced by the Herculaneum smelter was used in batteries, but that additional applications included ammunition and construction materials. That sparked accusations that President Obama had intentionally forced the company to stop smelting lead so that no lead bullets would be produced in the U.S. However, that claims is wrong on two key fronts: the EPA standard was established while President George W. Bush was in office, and lead smelted in the U.S. can still be used for ammunition. The EPA changed the ambient air quality standard for lead from 1.5 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air to 0.15 micrograms in October 2008 — a full two months before President Obama was sworn into office in January 2009. That means the change was not a backdoor attempt by Obama to implement gun control measures, as has been claimed. Also, even though the Doe Run Company no longer smelts lead from ore to produce bullets, the company has said that it could continue producing bullets using secondary lead: Lead is used in numerous other products, including ammunition and construction materials, as well as to protect against radiation in medical and military applications. While most applications can use secondary lead, those applications that require primary lead will need to import the lead metal in the future. Any additional demand for lead (above that which can be met through recycling at secondary smelters) will also have to be met through imports. Given all that, we’re calling claims that the Doe Run Company closing its primary lead smelter was a backdoor attempt at gun regulation “fiction.” ","Government"

But reports that Rich was on his way to testify about Hillary Clinton, or that his “assassination” has led to the FBI capturing a Clinton “hit team” are false. WUSA 9 in Washington reported that Rich was shot and killed in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Northwest D.C. in what appeared to be a robbery gone wrong: The shooting happened in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW on Sunday at 4:19 a.m., Metropolitan Police said. Police arrived at the scene and found Conrad conscious and breathing. He was suffering from gunshot wounds. Conrad was taken to the hospital where he later died from his injuries. “A lot of my girlfriends around here are talking about this and looking out for one another. We don’t want anyone walking by themselves,” neighbor Katie Ferguson said. “It’s scary. I want something done and so far there is a lot of talk, but what’s really being done?” Officials said they are looking into the possibility that Rich’s murder is connected to other recent robberies in the area. The sad story of Seth Rich’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them. What Does It Mean quickly spread the Russian propaganda in the U.S. with a story appearing under the headline, “Assassination of Top U.S. Democratic Party Official Leads to FBI Capture of Clinton Team,” that reports : A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City. Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place. There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights. While robbery has been cited as a motive in Rich’s death, it’s still not clear why he was murdered. His parents told the Inquisitor that if it was an attempted robbery, his attacker had failed since Rich still had cash on him when he was found So, while it’s not clear why Rich was murdered, reports that he was assassinated by a Clinton hit team that came from Russian propaganda should be considered fiction.

First, its important to note that neither Brezler nor Clinton faced criminal charges for sending classified documents over private email accounts and/or private email servers. A panel of officers recommended that he be discharged from the Marine Corps during an administrative hearing — but he wasn’t charged criminally. Second, investigators found that Brezler had sent more than 100 classified documents with his personal email account — not just the one involving a corrupt Afghan police chief.

Account to warn a fellow Marine that Sarwar Jan, an Afghan police chief, was corrupt, Foreign Policy reports : Brezler had responded in July 2012 to a request for information from deployed Marines about the police chief, Sarwar Jan, who Brezler helped to oust from power in another district in Afghanistan during a deployment spanning parts of 2009 and 2010. On August 10, 2012, just weeks after Brezler sent his warning, the police chief’s teenage servant and alleged sex abuse victim, Aynoddin, opened fire on a U.S. base, killing three Marines and critically wounding a fourth. Now, Brezler is expected to go before an administrative board in December that could oust him from the Marine Corps. Lt. Gen. Richard Mills took action against Brezler for sending the classified document via personal email account (even though he reportedly saved lives by doing so), and following an administrative hearing in 2013, a panel of officers recommended that Brezler be discharge from the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps Times reports : The Pentagon’s investigative agency has cleared the commanding general of Marine Forces Reserve of whistleblower reprisal against a Marine civil affairs officer who reached out to a member of Congress for help. In a new report, the Defense Department Inspector General’s office found that while Lt. Gen. Richard Mills did take adverse administrative action against Maj. Jason Brezler — touted in media reports last year as a hero for warning about a war-zone threat — Mills’ actions were not motivated by retaliation. After FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a personal email server, despite “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information,” there was public outcry from those who compared the cases of Brezler and Clinton. For his part, Major Bezler, who has been locked in a legal battle over his handling of classified information, said through an attorney that he would use Comey’s determination about Clinton’s use of a personal email server to argue his case, the Washington Post reports : An attorney for Brezler, Michael J. Bowe, said that he intends to cite the treatment of Clinton “as one of the many, and most egregious examples” of how severely Brezler was punished. FBI Director James B. Comey announced Tuesday that he would not recommend the U.S. government pursue federal charges against Clinton, but he rebuked her “extremely careless” use of a private, unclassified email server while serving as secretary of state. The FBI found that 110 of her emails contained classified information. So, comparisons between the two cases ring mostly true. Neither Clinton nor Brezler faced criminal charges for sending the classified documents — but Brezler faced substantial punishment from superior officers who recommended his discharge. ","Government"
"All 4th of July Fireworks Canceled Due to Terrorism Fears-Fiction!","2016-06-27 13:10:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/4th-july-fireworks-canceled-due-terrorism-fears/"," Reports that all fireworks displays for the 4th of July have been canceled due to fears about terrorism have gone viral.

The story surfaced with a report at the Christian Times Newspaper under the headline, “BREAKING: Feds Cancel ALL July 4th Fireworks Due to Terror Fears.” The report begins: Thursday that Fourth of July fireworks shows across the U.S. will be canceled for safety and security reasons. Representatives from the FBI, DOD, and Department of Homeland Security held a joint press conference in Washington to announce the unprecedented policy move. “Ongoing threats to American national security from ISIS, domestic terrorists, and foreign terrorist organizations led federal authorities to determine that a cancellation of July 4th fireworks is necessary to reduce potential attack scenarios,” said Terrance Lively, a counter-terrorism expert with the DHS. However, a quick glance at the Christian Times Newspaper’s disclaimer reveals that it’s not a reputable source for news. It states that the site makes clear that “not all stories are necessarily grounded in fact.” Given the fake news website’s resemblance in name and branding to the reputable Christian Times , there’s often confusion about the credibility of the website. We can confirm, however, that reports that all fireworks shows have been canceled are false. ","Government"

Because it’s impossible to definitively prove that a historical quote does not exist, we’re going to report this one as fiction until evidence proving otherwise surfaces. The quote has been making the rounds in memes and on discussion boards for years: To anger a conservative, lie to him. To anger a liberal, tell him the truth. Barry Popik, a contributing editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, investigated the quote and found that it first appeared in print sometime around 2007. Early on, the quote was attributed to an “unknown source.” It was first attributed to Roosevelt in 2009, and by 2010 it was regularly being attributed to him. That progression suggests the quote was a modern invention and Theodore Roosevelt’s name was attached to it nearly 100 years after his death. We also searched archives of Theodore Roosevelt’s letters in the National Archives for any references to the quote — but nothing turned up. Given that no official records linking Theodore Roosevelt to this quote on liberals and conservatives, we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","Government"
"Obama Declares June LGBT Pride Month-Truth!","2016-06-02 09:55:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-declares-june-lgbt-pride-month/"," President Obama has declared June Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. "," It’s true that President Obama issued a proclamation declaring June 2016 LGBT Pride Month. Obama issued a presidential proclamation on May 31, 2016, that declared June 2016 LGBT Pride month and called on “the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.” The presidential proclamation state, in part: Since our founding, America has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect Union.  This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth.  The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society.  They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment — under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics.  This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice. Last year’s landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines.  For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals. And this wasn’t the first time President Obama has declared June LGBT Pride month, either. The president also declared June 2015 LGBT Pride month through a presidential proclamation issued in May 2015 . ","Government"

"," President Obama was named the 5th best president by the University of Georgia or by Texas A&M. Those rumors started in March 2014 with a post at Zipper Weasel , a spoof website with the tag line “Scouring the Bowels of the Internet.” The story, which appeared under the headline “Texas A&M Study: Obama The Fifth Best President in History” showed a screen shot of the so-called study that ranked the top five presidents as such 1 Reagan & Lincoln tied for first 2 Seventeen presidents tied for second 3 Twenty-three presidents tied for third 4 Jimmy Carter came in fourth, and… 5 Obama was fifth Considering that Obama was the 44th president of the United States, and that the so-called study lists 43 former presidents as finishing ahead of him, it was obviously a gag meant to imply that Obama was actually the worst president in U.S. history. Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz fanned the flames in 2014 by retweeting the Texas A&M study with the hashtag #AggieJoke — but many of Cruz’s followers simply read the headline and missed the joke: That led a Texas A&M official to go on the record with The Eagle , the university’s student newspaper , to clarify that the so-called study was a hoax: The study is clearly a joke. The click-bait headline combines Texas A&M + Obama + “best president,” but when you read through the “methodology” Obama is actually the worst president. The A&M spokesman said the chain-joke-spam-letter first cropped up in the early fall and that he wasn’t sure why it had just resurfaced. He said the university had not formally distanced themselves from the study because officials didn’t want to help it spread. Not that there was ever any doubt, but Texas A&M University has nothing to do with the chain study about President Barack Obama that’s spreading around. An A&M spokesman said it’s a hoax. The statement attributed to the “Public Relations Office at A&M” is fabricated. The post has caught fire recently and was tweeted out by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday afternoon. It’s all over right-wing blogs and the social media accounts of the faithful.

"," A fake news website is behind rumors that Anonymous has released Donald Trump’s tax returns. Free Wood Post published the story under the headline “Anonymous Hacks IRS Database — Publishes Trump’s Tax Records.” The site reported that Anonymous recovered 12 years of Trump’s tax returns and released them to “hundreds of top websites” that published and then removed them within minutes: Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson stated last week that “there has been no year in which Trump paid zero taxes”. In 2012, this was true. He earned $37,746,530, far less that the $400+ million he claims. His final tax burden? Trump didn’t pay $0 in taxes, he actually received a tax refund of $7,832,224. That’s right, he cashed in a 7.8-million dollar tax refund. Recently, Trump stated that “I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.” So, how did Trump “earn” a tax refund? According to his return, he had approximately $37,743,000 in itemized deductions. In addition to massive business write-offs for legal fees relating to his fraudulent Trump “University” and fraudulent real estate transactions, Trump had other more unusual deductions. Trump’s deductions ranged from $118,923 for “Tribble Hair Services” to a $3.8 million dollar write-off for “Anal Bleaching” both listed as an “image expense.” He also made numerous charitable contributions to places like The National Association for the Advancement of White Men and the Trump Fund which provides financial and emotional assistance to wealthy men going through divorce. The Trump family also paid salaries to their numerous employees including, eight chauffeurs, two yacht captains, four pilots for their private jets, two professional dog walkers, one full-time “Tribble stylist” and perhaps most unusual of all a “live-in Hillary Clinton Impressionist” supposedly used for “debate prep”. Of course given the sordid details revealed about Trump’s “Favorite Fantasy Scenario” in the Ashley Madison hack, he likely has other uses for the unfortunate impressionist. Within days, the story had been shared more than 37,000 times on Facebook. Taken out of contect, many believed that the report was true — but that’s not the case.

"," Mary Ann Carlson didn’t say that gun owners are likely to commit a crime, or that gun registration should be used to arrest people before they commit crimes. Mary Ann Carlson was, however, defeated in a Vermont state senate race in the mid 1990s after introducing gun control legislation that would have established a gun registry and a wait period for buying handguns. Mary Ann Carlson’s supposed quote appeared in a long list of quotes from lawmakers about taking guns away from people that was posted at the pro-gun website The Truth About Guns in July 2014. The list attacked the argument that “nobody wants to take your guns away” by listing quotes from lawmakers who supposedly want to just that. Among them was Mary Ann Carlson, a former Democratic state senator from Vermont: Vermont State Mary Ann Carlson (D) does. “We must be able to arrest people before they commit crimes. By registering guns and knowing who has them we can do that. If they have guns they are pretty likely to commit a crime.” From there, the Mary Ann Carlson’s gun control quote made its way to a Reddit discussion forum , where people commented that Mary Ann Carlson had lost her seat in the Vermont State Senate over the comment or because she introduced gun control legislation, which have been common claims over the years. And Mary Ann Carlson’s alleged quote about arresting criminals before they commit crimes isn’t new — it’s been making the rounds since at least 2002 . Let’s start with what’s true about this rumor. Mary Ann Carlson lost her seat in the Vermont Senate in the mid-1990s after introducing a number of gun control bills (it’s been falsely reported that Mary Ann Carlson lost her senate seat as recently as 2014). In an interview with the New Haven Register in 2013, Carlson said her stance on gun control likely contributed to her defeat: Mary Ann Carlson, a former Democratic senator from Bennington County, said she experienced the backlash of Vermont’s strong gun culture after introducing legislation in 1994 that would have restricted semi-automatic weapons and required gun registration in Vermont. Carlson was defeated in the ensuing election and said her bill played a role in that defeat. “I think probably the NRA came after me,” she said. “There was a bumper sticker out that said, ‘guns and ammo yes, Carlson no.'”Carlson and other sponsors were looking to keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not own them, she said. She still believes that “many incredible people who have guns use them responsibly” and those responsible gun owners could help create restrictions that would prevent gun violence. “I wish that the … people who use guns responsibly would speak out so people who use guns irresponsibly can’t just go out and buy a gun and the next day use it,” Carlson said. As for her supposed quotes about arresting criminals before they commit crimes, or about all gun owners being criminals, we couldn’t find any record of her actually saying those things. Mary Ann Carlson also directly denied making those remarks on a local Vermont blog back in 2003, stating that she was a supporter of civil liberties and that the quotes didn’t jibe with her beliefs. So, given that Mary Ann Carlson apparently lost her senate seat after introducing gun control bills, and because there’s no record of her making the quotes that have been attributed to her, we’re labeling this one truth and fiction.

We cannot realistically expect these young drivers not to text and drive,” said Ms. Hinga. “The bumpered texting lane is our attempt to mitigate the dangers of texting while driving and is a plan that we believe will save thousands of lives.” MDX says it has entered into a memorandum of understanding with a national road consultant to draft plans for installing bumpers along each side of the middle lane of the Dolphin, an improvement expected to cost the County upwards of $75 million dollars. The Authority says it has already started to assess the viability of installing additional texting lanes on other County thoroughfares.

"Denmark Teacher Rails Against Socialism, Bernie Sanders-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-05-20 10:06:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/denmark-teacher-rails-against-socialism-bernie-sanders/"," A message written by a schoolteacher in Denmark makes a number of claims about free education, taxes in Denmark and the impact of socialism. "," A viral meme that was allegedly written by a schoolteacher in Denmark about the country’s high tax rates and socialism’s impact on the country has been making the rounds on social media. It’s not clear exactly where the meme originated, or if it was actually written by a schoolteacher in Denmark, but it cites specific statistics that are relatively easy to fact check. We found that the meme contains a mixture of truth and fiction. Here’s a look at its individual claims: The Minimum Income Tax in Demark is 40% – Truth! Denmark uses a progressive tax structure , which means that tax rates increase as income increases. The minimum income tax rate is 41% in Denmark, and the highest is approximately 56%. In 2015, t he marginal income tax rate in Denmark was quoted at 55.80%. That means Danes would pay the marginal tax rate on all income that exceeds a certain amount. That number has fluctuated over the last 20 years. The high came in 1997 with a 61.12% marginal income tax rate, and the low came in 2010 with a 55.40% rate, Trading Economics reports . So, even though the marginal tax rate goes as high as 56%, the effective rate that most Danes pay ranges from 35% to 48%. There’s a 25% Sales Tax in Denmark- Truth! It’s true that Denmark has had a 25% sales tax rate on most goods and services over the last 10 years. Denmark Taxes 80 Cents on the Dollar- Reported as Fiction! We couldn’t find anything to support the claim that 80% of every dollar goes to taxes in Denmark. The highest marginal income tax rate there over the last 20 years has been 65.9 percent , so it’s not clear what other taxes the 80% figuring is using to get to that number. Denmark Charges 180% Tax on Cars- Truth! Denmark levies a 180% tax on cars to discourage its citizens from driving them — but automobile taxes are actually even more than that. The 180% tax on top of the basic sale prices of cars does not include sales and registration fees, ownership tax and insurance tax. When all those taxes are factored in, it’s estimated that total taxes on a car over 12 years would be approximately $36,000 in Denmark. Denmark Has the Highest Tax Rate in the World- Fiction! Denmark’s overall tax rates were ranked third highest in the world in 2015, according the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Because of progressive income tax structures, OECD doesn’t use tax rates alone to determine which countries have the highest rates. Rather, it ranks tax rates based on what percentage of earnings goes toward taxes. Using that metric, Denmark residents pay 38.9 percent of their total earnings in taxes. That ranked third on the list of highest rates behind Belgium (42.8%) and Germany (39.9%). Denmark’s Suicide Rate Has Averaged 20.8 Per 100,000 People- Fiction! Denmark’s suicide rate peaked at more than 30 per 100,000 people in 1980, and it was deemed one of the world’s eight “high risk” countries for suicide in a National Institutes of Health study . However, after the suicide rate peaked in 1980, it has dropped considerably over the last 30 years. By 2012, Denmark’s suicide rate had dropped to 8.8 per 100,000, and it’s remained static ever since, according to World Health Organization data . ","Government"

"," There’s no truth to reports that three states have passed “two pet maximum” ordinances. That rumor started with the fake news website Associated Media Coverage. The report, which had been shared more than 10,000 on Facebook within day of being posted on May 6th, reports : The ordinance was officially passed this week by state politicians in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri. According to statistics gathered and published by The Humane Society of the United States, abandoned pet rates have sky-rocketed in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri over the past 2 years. State representatives from Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are hopeful that this new ordinance will drastically reduce the amount of abandoned pets within their respective states. Statistics continue to show that local Humane Society shelters throughout Texas, Arizona, and Missouri, do not have the proper size of facilities to house the animals at the high rate they are receiving them. This leads to thousands of animals being euthanized almost immediately, which in-turn is costly for the tax-payer. The first clue that this story is a hoax is its writer’s lack of understanding in how laws are passed. Municipal authorities — cities, villages or towns — enact ordinances , not state legislatures. That means it would be possible for state governments to enact a “two pet maximum” ordinance — or any ordinance for that matter. And although Associated Media Coverage sounds like an official news outlet, it’s far from it. We’ve investigated multiple fake news stories from this site — favorites include reports that 11 states are implementing motorcycle curfews and that the FDA has banned the “juice” for vaping e-cigarettes . However, even though the report that three states have made it illegal to own more than two pets are false, there are many local ordinances on the books in cities across the country that restrict the number of pets residents can own, according to Michigan State University’s Animal Law Center : Pet limitation ordinances fall squarely within this legitimate exercise of police power. In an early case, the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld a borough ordinance that limited the number of licensed dogs one could own to three.  On appeal, a woman who apparently owned up to 39 dogs summarily challenged the ordinance as unreasonable. The court, however, found that, “[r]easonableness of an ordinance is ordinarily a question of fact. No facts have here been presented to establish that the ordinance is not reasonable and we cannot say that it is unreasonable upon its face when there is nothing to show the conditions that prevail in this particular municipality.” State v. Beckert , 61 A.2d 213 (N.J.Sup. 1948). Thus, one challenging such an ordinance has a high burden to meet, even in the absence of any showing that such an ordinance was necessary. So, even though the report that three states have limited the number of pets an individual can own is false, there are actual ordinances on the books across the country that do just that.

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) passed regulations throughout early 2015 requiring manufactures of electronic cigarettes to retroactively submit marketing applications for their products. This was perceived to be a huge blow to the electronic cigarette industry as the fees accrued by manufactures submitting these applications were projected in the millions. The FDA provided impacted companies two years to submit their applications and allowed for them to continue selling the products under review during this two-year window. Within days of being published in mid-March 2016 the story had been viewed more than 20,000 times.

The statistics found on the U.D.O.T website indicate that roughly 47% of motorcyclist fatalities in both 2014 and 2015 reportedly occurred during the hours of 10:30 PM – 4:45 AM. Little is known about Associated Media Coverage . The site had only published a handful of stories when the report about a motorcycle curfew went viral in March 2016. The site doesn’t identify itself as satire or fake news, but the story is pretty easy to prove false. First, state legislatures don’t adopt ordinances , as the story claims. Only city or town governments adopt ordinances. State governments adopt statutes. That’s the first clue that this story is bogus. Second, there’s nothing about a new motorcycle curfew posted on the Department of Transportations website, and there surely would be if the story was true. Third, the motorcycle lobby hasn’t raised a ruckus over the so-called motorcycle curfew, and neither have rider groups. Given the fact that this story gets key details of the lawmaking process wrong (ordinances vs. statutes), and that there’s no other mention of a so-called motorcycle curfew anywhere on the web outside of this story, we’re calling this one false.

"Star of David Appears on the Dollar Bill-Fiction!","2016-03-01 09:09:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/star-of-david-appears-on-the-dollar-bill/"," Claims that the Star of David appears on the dollar bill to honor a Jewish man named Hyam Salomon for his contributions to the Revolutionary war have persisted for years. "," There’s no historical evidence proving that the Star of David, or any other Jewish symbol, was intentionally included on U.S. currency, or in official seals. Emails telling the story of Hyam Salomon, George Washington’s financial advisor and assistant, have been circulating since as early as 2002. The email claims that Salomon died penniless after giving all of his wealth to help the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, and that Washington found a unique way to honor him: If you take a one dollar bill out of your pocket and look at the back at the Eagle, the stars above the Eagle’s head are in the six point Star of David to honor Jews. If you turn the Eagle upside down you will see a configuration in the likeness of a Menorah….both at the insistence of George Washington who said we should never forget the Jewish people and what they have done in the interest of America. “The Eagle” that the email is referring to is actually called the Great Seal of the United States, which appears on the back of dollar bills: Obviously, paper currency wasn’t used in colonial times. Up until the 1920s, dollar bills were “ silver certificates ,” or coins, issued by the Treasury Department. The Great Seal of the United States was added to the back of paper dollar bills in the 1930s. Given all that, the real question is whether or not the Great Seal of the United States includes the Star of David, not whether or not the dollar bill does. And historical records reveal that the Star of David was not intentionally included in the design of the Great Seal of the United States. Congress put a lot of thought into the Great Seal of the United States. It considered the design for a full six years before finally approving it in 1782. And, although a pattern of stars that appears above the eagle’s head loosely resembles the Star of David, that wasn’t the original intent of its creator, Charles Thomas. The pattern is known as rising “constellation” made up of 13 individual stars that represent the 13 original colonies. Thomas offers a full explanation of the seal’s symbolism here : “The Escutcheon is composed of the chief [upper part of shield] & pale [perpendicular band], the two most honorable ordinaries [figures of heraldry]. The Pieces, paly [alternating pales], represent the several states all joined in one solid compact entire, supporting a Chief, which unites the whole & represents Congress. The Motto alludes to this union. The pales in the arms are kept closely united by the Chief and the Chief depends on that union & the strength resulting from it for its support, to denote the Confederacy of the United States of America & the preservation of their union through Congress. “The colours of the pales are those used in the flag of the United States of America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue, the colour of the Chief signifies vigilance, perseverance & justice. The Olive branch and arrows denote the power of peace & war which is exclusively vested in Congress. The Constellation denotes a new State taking its place and rank among other sovereign powers. The Escutcheon is born on the breast of an American Eagle without any other supporters [figures represented as holding up the shield] to denote that the United States of America ought to rely on their own Virtue. So, the Star of David was not intentionally included in the Great Seal of the United States, and it wasn’t intentionally included on the dollar bill, either. But historical accounts of Hyam Salomon’s role in the Revolutionary War are mostly true. He loaned $200,000 to the U.S. government to help in its fight against the British, and he never collected on the loan, according to Encyclopedia Britannica : Among his many other contributions to the Colonies, Salomon subscribed heavily to government loans, endorsed notes, gave generously to soldiers, and equipped several military units with his own money.Robert Morris, the superintendent of finance from 1781 to 1784, appointed Salomon as broker to his office. Morris records in his diary that between 1781 and 1784 Salomon lent more than $200,000. In addition, he made private loans to prominent statesmen such as James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe, from whom he would not take interest. In all, the government owed Salomon more than $600,000. Generations of his descendants tried in vain to collect some portion of these loans, which had helped to impoverish Salomon in his last years. Even so, the claim that the Star of David was put on the dollar bill to honor the contributions of Hyam Salomon is false. ","Government"
"Justice Antonin Scalia’s Death Sentence Quote-Mostly Fiction!","2016-02-16 09:26:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/justice-antonin-scalias-death-sentence-quote/"," Late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has been widely quoted as saying, “Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached.” "," Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia never made this statement, but it does loosely summarize views expressed by Scalia in a 1993 opinion. The quote resurfaced following Antonin Scalia’s unexpected death in February 2016. As the late justice’s 30-year legacy on the U.S. Supreme Court was being celebrated and scrutinized, his so-called quote about innocence and the death sentence got a lot of airtime. Legend has it that Scalia once said: “Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached.” There’s no record of Antonin Scalia ever actually saying that. He did, however, write in a 1993 opinion (that was joined by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas) that Constitution doesn’t make room for new trials for death row inmates who present new evidence. Scalia wrote the infamous opinion for Herrera v. Collins. Leonel Torres Herrera was charged with capital murder in the death of a Texas Department of Public Safety officer who was shot along a desolate stretch of highway in 1981. Herrera was found guilty and was sentenced to death. However, Herrera later claimed in a federal court that new evidence proved that he was innocent of the murder, and that putting an innocent man to death violated the Eight Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which rejected Herrera’s claim that a Texas court’s refusal to hear new evidence in the case did not violate Herrera’s constitutional rights, or due process. Rehnquist wrote in the majority opinion that if the high court had sided with Herrera, “few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system.” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring opinion in the case (which means he agreed with the decision, but for different reasons than cited in the majority opinion). In that opinion, Scalia made what would later morph into the controversial statement about “mere factual innocence” not being reason enough to carry out a sentence. In the opinion, Scalia wrote: We granted certiorari on the question whether it violates due process or constitutes cruel and unusual punishment for a State to execute a person who, having been convicted of murder after a full and fair trial, later alleges that newly discovered evidence shows him to be “actually innocent.” I would have preferred to decide that question, particularly since, as the Court’s discussion shows, it is perfectly clear what the answer is: There is no basis in text, tradition, or even in contemporary practice (if that were enough), for finding in the Constitution a right to demand judicial consideration of newly discovered evidence of innocence brought forward after conviction. In saying that such a right exists, the dissenters apply nothing but their personal opinions to invalidate the rules of more than two thirds of the States, and a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure for which this Court itself is responsible. If the system that has been in place for 200 years (and remains widely approved) “shocks” the dissenters’ consciences, post, at 1, perhaps they should doubt the calibration of their consciences, or, better still, the usefulness of “conscience shocking” as a legal test. Over the years, the highlighted quote was simplified and shrunk down into, “Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached.” While there’s no record of Antonin Scalia ever making that statement, it does mirror his views in Herrera v. Collins. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly fiction. ","Government"
"Marine’s Open Letter to Sarah Palin-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-01-26 14:05:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marines-open-letter-to-sarah-palin/"," A former Marine called out Sarah Palin for blaming her son, Trek Palin’s, arrest for domestic violence and weapons violations on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an open letter. "," We can confirm that a former Marine wrote an open letter to Sarah Palin in which he said she had used PTSD to “divert blame from her family’s abhorrent, violent behavior.” The open letter surfaced days after Sarah Palin said Trek Palin’s arrest for domestic violence was linked to PTSD, and more specifically, to President Obama for not doing more to help veterans. Palin delivered the remarks in a January XX campaign stop with Donald Trump in Kentucky, the Daily Mail reports : ‘I guess it’s kind of the elephant in the room – because my own family, going through what we’re going through today with my son, a combat vet having served in a Stryker brigade, fighting for you all, America, in the war zone. But my son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened,’ Palin said at the Wednesday rally. ‘They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country, and that starts at the top,’ Palin said. She continued to say it’s a ‘shame’ that military personnel come home and ‘have to wonder if they’re respected anymore’. ‘So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America’s finest that we’ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them,’ she said. In response, former Marine and Navy Officer Chris Marks wrote the open letter. The open letter, which was published on Marks’ personal blog site , begins: I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican.  I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD.  I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son’s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD.   Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family’s abhorrent, violent behavior. Marks also called for Palin to use her “celebrity status” to help veterans in a more productive, less political manner. And Marks wasn’t the only veteran that took exception with Palin’s comments. Other veterans who spoke out in the media said Palin had used “dangerous stereotyping” about PTSTD and veterans in her remarks, the Boston Globe reports , ","Government"

"," Federal estate tax rates didn’t jump from 0% to 55% on January 1, 2016. In fact, the vast majority of estates will pay no federal estate tax at all in 2016. The basic exclusion amount for estate taxes has risen to $5.450 million, up from $5.430 million in 2015. That means estates worth less than $5.450 million don’t pay any estate tax at all. And the claim that estate tax rates have risen couldn’t be further from the truth. In 2001, estates worth more than $675,000 were taxed at the top rate of 55%. By 2013, however, the top estate tax rate had dropped to 40%, and only estates worth more than $5.25 million were taxed. Today, 40% remains the top estate tax rate, and that only applies to estates worth more than $5.450 million, according to the Tax Foundation . Overall, the estate tax accounts for less than 1% of total federal revenue each year. In 2014, the Office of Budget Management reported that the estate tax raised $19.3 billion, about 0.6% of total federal revenue. So, reports that the estate tax rate has jumped at all — let alone from 0% to 55% — couldn’t be any more wrong. ","Government"
"2016 Tax Increases Due To Obamacare-Fiction!","2016-01-20 11:35:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/2016-tax-increases-due-to-obamacare/"," Emails warning about new tax increases taking effect on January 1, 2016, because of Obamacare have flooded inboxes and stirred panic among taxpayers. "," Claims about 2016 tax increases due to the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) are mostly fiction. An outdated and incorrect chain email that makes the rounds every January has widely circulated yet again in 2016. The email makes a number of claims about Medicare and capital gains taxes going into effect on January 1, 2016, to help fund Obamacare. We investigated those claims in 2015, and found them to be false and misleading. You can read our full coverage here . Otherwise, here’s a brief overview of each claim, and tax rates you can expect to pay in 2016: Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% : Most taxpayers will pay 1.45% in Medicare tax in 2016. Top earners ($125,000 individual/$250,000 couple) will pay a 0.9% surcharge, bringing the top Medicare tax to 2.35% , which has remained unchanged from 2013. Top income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%: The top income tax bracket in 2016 ($415,000 individual/$466,950 couple) will be 39.6%, the same as in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The rate was increased under the bipartisan American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012, not Obamacare. Top income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%: The Affordable Care Act set the top income payroll tax at 42.5% effective January 2013; however, that rate does not reflect additional state payroll taxes. Capital Gains taxes went from 15% to 28%: The maximum net capital gain tax rate is 20% in 2016, but most taxpayers pay less than that. However, a 25-28% tax rate does apply to certain types of capital gains, the IRS reports . Estate taxes went from 0 to 55%: Overall, estate tax rates have decreased over the last 15 years (the rate was 55% in 2001, and it was set at 40% in 2013). Estates of those who die in 2016 will have a basic exclusion amount of $5.450 million , up from the $5.430 million exclusion in 2015. The basic exclusion is the amount an individual can leave to heirs without paying federal estate taxes. One 2016 tax increase under Obamacare that is not included on this list is the individual mandate excise tax rate. Those who do not purchase a “qualifying” health insurance policy must pay it. The rate increased to 2.5% of adjusted gross income in 2016, up from 2% in 2015 and 1% in 2014, according to Americans for Tax Reform . The only tax levied under the Affordable Care Act that has not yet taken effect is the excise tax on comprehensive health insurance plans, otherwise known as the tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans. That’s set to take effect in January 2018. Be leery of any warnings about “new” taxes because of the Affordable Care Act before that. ","Government"

"," False reports that capital gains taxes are jumping from 15 to 28% have surfaced in each of the last three years, and 2016 is no different. Rumor has it that capital gains taxes will jump 13% in 2016 (or whatever new tax year it happens to be) because of the Affordable Care Act’s net income surtax, but that’s simply not true. In both 2011 and 2012, capital gains taxes were capped at 15%, a historically low level. The bipartisan American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) set capital gains tax at 20% in 2013, with top earners ($200,000/individual, $250,000 couple) facing an additional 2.3% because of the Affordable Care Act’s net income surtax . That left federal capital gains taxes at 23.3% for the nation’s top earners. But states also levy capital gains taxes that need to be factored in. On average, state capital gains taxes were a little more than 5%. With state and federal taxes factored in, top earners paid a 28.7% capital gains tax rate in 2014. Those who were not in the top income bracket paid 25%, the Tax Foundation reports . In 2016, capital gains tax rates will stay about the same. The Tax Foundation reports that top earners can expect to pay 28.6% in 2016 with both state and federal taxes factored in. In conclusion, the claim that 2016 capital gains taxes are jumping from 15% to 28% in 2016 is wrong. The rate for top earners will stay the same at about 28.6%. ","Government"
"Action Needed for Social Security Changes on May 1, 2016-Mostly Truth!","2016-01-14 11:45:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/action-needed-for-social-security-changes-on-may-1-2016/"," There are warnings that action might be needed to prevent Social Security benefit changes set to take effect on May 1, 2016 under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. "," Changes to Social Security’s “file and suspend” rules are set to take effect on May 1, 2016, and some people do need to take action before that to “opt out” of new rules. Changes to Social Security usually create a lot of panic among those who rely on it, so it’s important to note upfront that no changes will be made to how “ core benefits ” are calculated. In other words, if you already receive Social Security payments, these changes won’t impact your eligibility, or how much you receive. Social Security changes set to take effect on May 1, 2016, pertain to its “file and suspend” rules. Congress approved the changes through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (HR 1314 ). Basically, the changes apply to spousal benefits and to switching from spousal benefits to worker benefits before the age of 70. Under old rules, once a person reached the full retirement age (FRA) of 66, they could file for benefits and immediately suspend them until a later date. Then, a spouse age 62 or older could file for a spousal benefit and switch to a worker benefit until the age of 70. In the meantime, worker benefits for both spouses would continue to grow through delayed retirement credits. The Bipartisan Budget Act makes to major changes to Social Security’s file and suspend rule. First, spouses will no longer be able to change from a spousal benefit to a worker benefit before the age of 70 — the beneficiary will immediately receive the larger of the two. Second, the act ends the ability of workers to file and suspend benefits to either trigger a spousal benefit, or to protect the right to retroactive benefits. But there is a loophole that allows some Social Security beneficiaries who are approaching retirement age to be grandfathered into the old file and suspend rule before May 1, 2016, Forbes reports : If you will be 66 years or older come May 1, 2016, and you have not started your Social Security benefits, you should consider “filing and suspending” your worker’s benefits.  If you are married, the filing part triggers your spouse’s right to begin spousal benefits. The “suspend” part signifies that you will not immediately receive your worker’s benefit and the benefit will be deferred until you choose to claim it.  This will allow you to take advantage of the deferral credits, which increase your Social Security retirement benefits by 8 percent per year after full retirement age up until the age of 70.  Please note that this must be done before May 1, 2016 because after this date, a married worker will have to file and begin to receive benefits in order to trigger the spousal benefit. Click here for information about how file and suspend Social Security benefits before May 1, 2016. At the same time, beware of scammers who could take advantage of this rule change to steal your identity or to access your bank accounts. Keep in mind that the Social Security Administration (SSA) will never send emails asking you for personal information. Anytime your receive a suspicious phone call or email from someone claiming to represent the SSA, the agency advises that you immediately call your local Social Security office or call 1-800-772-1213 to see if it’s a scam or not.

"," You won’t need a passport to board domestic flights beginning in 2016, but that could eventually change for people living in some states. Questions about passports for domestic air travel have been brought up by implementation of the Real ID Act of 2005 . The measure, which was signed into law in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, created a national standard for state-issued driver’s licenses to clamp down on security. The Real ID Act set guidelines for states to verify the identity and/or immigration status of people who apply for a driver’s license or ID card. The law also required that a number of security features be included in the physical driver’s license or ID card to prevent tampering or duplication. As 2016 approached, four states — Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire and New York — had reportedly failed to meet some of these new federal verification guidelines. The federal government could stoop recognizing driver’s licenses and ID cards issued by these states until national standards are met. That includes the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which oversees airport security. But the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees TSA) said in early January 2016 that it would not require passports for domestic air travel, even if states had failed to meet Real ID guidelines: DHS is in the process of scheduling plans for implementing REAL ID enforcement at airports. DHS will ensure that the traveling public has ample notice (at least, 120 days) before any changes are made that might affect their travel planning. Until enforcement at the airports begins, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will continue to accept state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards from all states, as well other forms of acceptable identification listed on the TSA website. So, although it could change in the future, state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards from every state is all you need to board domestic flights. In fact, TSA even allows passengers who have forgotten or lost their state-issued IDs to board flights as long as their identities can be confirmed.

"Cabela’s Takes a Stand on Medical Excise Tax on Sporting Goods-Fiction!","2016-01-04 08:13:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cabelas-takes-a-stand-on-medical-excise-tax-on-sporting-goods/"," Those who purchase hunting and fishing gear at Cabela’s (and other retailers) now have to pay a medical excise tax established under Obamacare, according to social media posts. "," Obamacare’s medical excise tax doesn’t apply to sporting goods, and Cabela’s isn’t applying it to transactions there. The rumor started with a social media post that showed a Cabela’s receipt with a $5.82 charge for what’s identified as a “medical excise tax” back in 2013. According to the post, the 2.3% medical excise tax was supposed to be “hidden” from customers, but Cabela’s had taken a stand by including the charge as a separate line item on receipts. But Obamacare’s medical excise tax does not apply to sporting goods. Cabela’s mistakenly included the surcharge on customer receipts for one day — January 1, 2013 — and issued refunds to customers within a week. Joe Arterburn, a Cabela’s spokesperson, said that the 2.3% medical excise tax was applied to customer transactions because of a “glitch in the system.” Aterburn said the mistake came to light when customers notified the company that the medical excise tax surcharge had appeared on their sales receipts. The medical excise tax was established under Obamacare to help supplement the cost of providing insurance to the uninsured. Medical professionals pay the excise tax when they purchase medical devices defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) : Medical devices range from simple tongue depressors and bedpans to complex programmable pacemakers with micro-chip technology and laser surgical devices. In addition, medical devices include in vitro diagnostic products, such as general purpose lab equipment, reagents, and test kits, which may include monoclonal antibody technology.

"Ted Yoho Comments on African-American Voters-Fiction!","2015-12-30 08:24:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ted-yoho-comments-on-african-american-voters/"," Congressman Ted Yoho, a Republican from Florida, said that African-Americans should only be given a 3/5 vote. "," A fake news website is behind the bogus Ted Yoho quote about African-American voters. The fake news website Newslo published a report headlined, “Florida Representative Ted Yoho Says African-Americans Should Only be Given 3/5 of a Vote” in May 2014. The report quoted Ted Yoho as saying: “I can’t remember which founding father said it, but he said, the ability to vote, but vote uninformed, is as tragic or as dangerous as having a loaded gun and not know how to use it,” said Yoho, responding to an audience member who claimed that absentee voting was destroying elections. “Obviously anyone who doesn’t own their own property is going to be pretty clueless when it comes to voting.” Like most fake news stories that go viral, however, this one holds a sliver of truth. Ted Yoho drew unwanted headlines in May 2012 after a video surfaced of him campaigning for the congressional seat that he went on to win. In the video , Yoho said, “I’ve had some radical ideas about voting and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.” The comment was controversial in its own right, but Ted Yoho never said in the campaign stump speech that African-American voters should be given a 3/5 vote. The fake news story didn’t gain a lot of traction at the time it was published. However, the 3/5 voter claim was made into a meme that was widely shared on social media. Taken out of context, many believed that the comment was true — but it’s not. ","Government"
"New Hoverboard Law Takes Effect January 2016-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-12-28 10:44:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/new-hoverboard-law-takes-effect-january-2016/"," It’s been rumored that a hoverboard law taking effect on January 1, 2016, permits and regulates the use to hoverboards in public spaces. "," It’s true that a hoverboard law was set to take effect in California in January 2016. That law only applies to California, however, and even there local officials could restrict or ban the use of hoverboards in public places. Simply put: Hoverboard laws across the country are a mess. Whether or not hoverboards are legal in public spaces depends entirely on where you are. Each state — and city, for that matter — has its own hoverboard policy. California brought some clarity to hoverboard regulation with a hoveverboard law that was set to take effect on January 1, 2016. Before that, it was technically a crime to operate hoverboards (which were classified as motorized skateboards under the law) on sidewalks, roadways, bikeways or any other public trail systems. However, the new hoverboard law ( which can be viewed in its entirety here ) changes that. The law offers the first legal definition of “hoverboard,” which is referred to as an “electronically motorized board” under the law. It also makes hoverboards legal in some public spaces when certain restrictions are met. Hoverboard riders can’t be intoxicated, and they must be at least 16, according to the law: This bill would define the term “electrically motorized board.” The bill would prohibit the operation of an electrically motorized board upon a highway while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug. The bill would require the operator of an electrically motorized board to wear a helmet while operating an electrically motorized board upon a highway, bikeway, or any other public bicycle path, sidewalk, or trail. The bill would require an operator to be at least 16 years of age in order to operate an electrically motorized board. The bill would also require electrically motorized boards to be equipped with safety equipment, as specified, and restrict the operation speed of electrically motorized boards. Because a violation of these provisions would be punishable as an infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The law also opens the door for cities in California to pass their own laws regulating the use of hoverboards. That means you’ll have to check local ordinances on hoverboards before to make sure you’re not breaking the law. Police in Los Angeles have said that hoverboards will not be allowed on public walkways there, for example. And many private property owners have banned hoverboards over liability concerns, so the new hoverboard law doesn’t give riders free reign by any measure. And although California has become the first state to officially define, regulate and permit hoverboards, hoverboards are still illegal in most parts of the country. Other states and municipalities have used pre-existing laws to determine whether or not hoverboards are allowed. In New York City, for example, public officials have deemed hoverboards illegal under New York State Traffic Law 114-d . The code regulates the use of electronic “personal assist” devices in public spaces. A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Transportation has explained that the law’s definition of “electronic personal assist mobility device” was broad enough to include hoverboards, and that they would be regulated as such. In NYC, because the population is above 1 million people, electronic personal assist device riders must be licensed, and the devices must be registered with the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. Hoverboards are illegal, the spokesperson said , because the NYSDMV would refuse to register them for legal use: NYSDMV’s position is that these vehicles are likely “Electric personal assist mobility devices.” NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law 114-d defines “Electric personal assist mobility device” as “Every self-balancing, two non-tandem wheeled device designed to transport one person by means of an electric propulsion system with an average output of not more than seven hundred fifty watts (one horsepower), and the maximum speed of which on a paved level surface, when propelled solely by its electric propulsion system while ridden by an operator weighing one hundred seventy pounds, is less than twelve and one-half miles per hour.” NYS VTL 125 generally defines “motor vehicles” as “Every vehicle operated or driven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power.” However, VTL 125 specifically excludes some classes of vehicles from the definition of “motor vehicles.” Under VTL 126(a-1), “electrical personal assistive mobility devices operated outside a city with a population of one million or more” are not considered motor vehicles. However, in NYC, because the city population is greater than one million, NYSDMV considers “hoverboards” that meet the definition of “electric personal assist mobility devices” the same as motor vehicles. Based on that interpretation, it would be illegal to operate a hoverboard in NYC without a valid license to drive a motor vehicle. Beyond that, the motor vehicle would need to be registered by NYSDMV (which NYSDMV will not do), inspected, insured, and otherwise treated as, and subject to regulation like, any other motor vehicle. A person who operates a hoverboard in NYC (or any other NYS city with a population greater than a million) would be subject to arrest and prosecution for myriad NYS VTL violations, including, but not limited to, driving a motor vehicle without valid registration or insurance. So, it’s true that a hoverboard law was set to take effect in California on January 1, 2016. But that law doesn’t give hoverboards free reign there. Hoverboard riders in California (and other states) are still subject to local laws and ordinances, some of which make hoverboards illegal and subject to steep fines. That’s why we’re classifying this one as both truth and fiction. ","Government"

"," A fake news website is behind false reports that the U.S. Supreme Court has awarded 40 acres of land and a mule to the ancestor of a black man. World News Daily Report published an article in December 2015 reporting that the Supreme Court made its decision after the man sued the federal government for “violating their obligations” to his great-grandfather, Elijah Brown: By a narrow 5-4 vote, the Supreme court ruled that the U.S. government had to hold the promises made to these 18,000 freed slaves, by granting the promised acreage and animals to their descendants. “This is the best day of my life,” Mr. Brown told reporters as he left the courtroom.“Justice has finally been done, after all these years. My great-grandfather can finally rest in peace!” Mr. Brown and his supporters were visibly happy when the court announced the verdict, applauding and cheering loudly as the court announced its decision. The Supreme court decision is based on military orders issued during the American Civil War. The orders dealing specifically with the freed slaves are called Special Field Orders, No. 15, and were issued by General William Tecumseh Sherman, commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi of the United States Army, on January 16, 1865. Within a week, the story had been shared more than 18,000 times on Facebook.Taken out of context, many were duped into believing that it was a credible report, but that’s not so. In its disclaimer , World News Daily Report states that it assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” That means it’s a fake news website. The story does have a least some basis in reality, however. At the conclusion of the Civil War, Union met with black ministers in Georgia to figure out ways for newly freed slaves to forge a new path. In what became known as Field Order 15 , Gen. William T. Sherman set aside 400,000 acres of land so that each slave in the area could be given “40 acres of land and a mule” to begin their lives anew. That was short lived. After Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson reversed the order and gave the land back to the original owners. Even though there’s a glimmer of truth in this report, however, the rumor that the Supreme Court had awarded a man 40 acres of land and mule is totally false. ","Government"
"Anti-gun Senator Shoots Intruder-Mostly Fiction!","2015-12-15 08:10:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/anti-gun-senator-shoots-intruder/"," It’s been reported that R.C. Soles, a former anti-gun senator from North Carolina, shot an intruder in his home. "," Former North Carolina State Sen. R.C. Soles shot an intruder at his North Carolina home in 2009, but the claim that Soles was an “anti-gun senator” doesn’t check out. The shooting unfolded at R.C. Soles’ home in Tabor City, North Carolina, in August 2009. Soles told police that two former clients of his law firm were trespassing on his property, and that he shot one of the men in the leg as he tried to break Soles’ door down. State investigators said that R.C. Soles had “acted unlawfully” in the shooting, and a grand jury agreed. A grand jury indicted Soles for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. Soles pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2010 and paid a $1,000 fine for the offense. Interestingly, that wasn’t Soles’ only run-in with a former client of his law firm. He was also charged with assault with a deadly weapon in 2012 for allegedly hitting another former client in the face with a metal walking cane, but he was found not guilty in that case. The idea that an anti-gun senator had shot an intruder started with a 2011 post on a Field & Stream community page . The commenter said that Soles, a Democrat and the longest serving North Carolina senator at the time, acted hypocritically because he had “made a career of being against gun ownership” and then used a gun in his own defense: The Senator, who has made a career of being against gun ownership for the general public, didn’t hesitate to defend himself with his own gun when he believed he was in immediate danger and he was the victim. In typical hypocritical liberal fashion, the “Do as I say and not as I do” Anti-Gun Activist Lawmaker picked up his gun and took action in what apparently was a self-defense shooting. Why hypocritical you may ask? It is because his long legislative record shows that the actions that he took to protect his family, his own response to a dangerous life threatening situation, are actions that he feels ordinary citizens should not have if they were faced with an identical situation. It has prompted some to ask if the Senator believes his life and personal safety is more valuable than yours or mine. But, this is to be expected from those who believe they can run our lives, raise our kids, and protect our families better than we can. The post is wrong on several fronts. First, R.C. Soles himself admitted in pleading guilty that he had not “acted in self defense.” Second, Soles hadn’t “made a career of being against gun ownership” before the shooting, either. The National Rifle Association gave Soles just one rating below a B+ for his gun-friendly views in the North Carolina State Senate from 1996-2008, according to VoteSmart.org . Grass Roots North Carolina, a non-profit dedicated to gun rights, gave R.C. Soles a lower favorability rating on gun rights between 1996 and 2008. That group rated Soles’ support of pro-gun legislation at 80%, 63%, 63%, 20%, 64% and 68%. So, it’s clear that Soles’ rating was from a local pro-gun group was lower than the NRA’s rating — but it’s not accurate to say that Soles had “made a career” of being against gun ownership based on his record, as has been claimed. Rumors about the so-called anti-gun senator who shot an intruder have cropped up a number of times since 2009. In 2013, the original Field & Stream post appeared on a FOX News community blog as a “flash back,” and that rekindled the story. In 2015, the story was re-reported on a blog site called Wizbang . That report made it appear that the tale of an anti-gun senator who shot an intruder was a new one, and the report repeated outdated and incorrect claims about the situation. So, although R.C. Soles did shoot an intruder back in 2009, we’re calling the claim that an anti-gun senator shot an intruder “mostly fiction.” Soles voting record just doesn’t support the claim that he was an “anti-gun senator.” ","Government"

"," We’re still looking into reports that Amazon pulled “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook” from the website, but those reports appear to be true. “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook: It Was a FEMA Drill to Promote Gun Control” is a book written by 12 contributing authors and edited by Jim Fetzer, a well-known conspiracy theorists. “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook” was released in October 2015 and attempts to prove that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 26 people dead, including 20 children, was actually a “staged” FEMA exercise perpetrated by President Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder to advance gun control measures ahead of a supposed “New World Order.” TruthorFiction.com has previously investigated these Sandy Hook conspiracy theories and found them to be unsupported by evidence and untrue. Click here to read our previous coverage. Reports that Amazon pulled “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook” from its online bookstore first surfaced in mid-November 2015. Jim Fetzer said in a press release that the book had sold around 500 copies through Amazon.com before the online retailer removed the book on November 19. According to the press release: The 425-page book presents 12 chapters exposing the complicity of local and federal authorities, and includes as a 19-page appendix titled “The FEMA Manual for Sandy Hook” (subtitled “Site Activation Call-down Drill Exercise Plan”), which outlines the event as a two-day drill operation. The FEMA Manual states, “The preparation for Mass Casualty is a drill designed to establish a learning environment for players to exercise emergency response plans, policies, and procedures as they pertain to a mass casualty incident involving children.” Fetzer says that local conspirators in Newtown, such as the alleged parents of the murdered children, have made out very well financially soliciting contributions from a gullible public and that Newtown has been showered with aid, including $50 million to build a new school. This compares with the $7 million typical construction budget for an elementary school. In response to Amazon’s removal of “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook,” Fetzer announced that the was making the book available for free via download.

"41 Senators Block Benefits for Veterans-Truth! & Outdated!","2015-11-23 13:49:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/41-senators-block-benefits-for-veterans-truth/"," There have been reports that 41 senators blocked benefits for veterans by voting against a bill that would have improved medical services for vets. "," It’s true that 41 senators voted against a veteran benefits bill back in 2014. Congress did successfully pass a spending bill that increased funding for veterans programs in September 2015, however. The rumor that 41 senators blocked a veteran benefits bill applies to the failed 2014 bill, not the successful 2015 bill. The failed measure from 2014 was called the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act. The bill would have directed an additional $21 billion to medical services and cost-of-living adjustments for veterans and caregivers over 10 years, the Washington Examiner reports : The bill would essentially offer VA health care services to all veterans, including those who do not have service-related problems and have incomes above current cutoff levels. It would also greatly expand a program that pays caregivers of disabled veterans a monthly stipend. Congress originally passed the measure for veterans of post-Sept. 11 wars; Sanders would expand it to all veterans. The caregivers provision is one of the single most expensive features of the bill, and it was put into the legislation over the objections of the Department of Veterans Affairs itself, which believes it would cost even more than Sanders estimated. Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont and 2016 presidential candidate, introduced the bill. Sanders posted a video recounting how 41 senators blocked the veteran benefits bill that has been viewed more than 130,000 times on YouTube: The rumor that 41 senators voted against the veteran benefits bill is based on a Senate vote that was held on February 27, 2014. On that day, 41 Republican senators voted against a motion to waive applicable budgetary discipline . The motion was required to fund Sanders’ veteran benefits bill. The 41 senators voted against a motion to waive sequestration, or budget policies that require new discretionary spending to be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. A three-fifths majority was required for the motion to waive budgetary discipline to pass, so it failed. The video posted by Bernie Sanders shows clips of Republican senators (including 2016 presidential hopeful Marco Rubio) discussing how cost issues had led them oppose the motion, and the veteran benefits bill. “I don’t think veterans want their programs to be enhanced if every penny of the money that’s going to enhance those programs is added to the debt of the United States of America,” Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, said on the Senate floor at the time. Marco Rubio said, “This bill has already been debated … It has many good elements in it,” Rubio said. “It also has a cost issue at a time when our nation owes close to $18 trillion. That was the reason why so many on my side of the aisle objected to it, and that’s why I would object to the motion made here today by the senator from Vermont.” So, it’s true that 41 Senators blocked a veteran benefits bill back in 2014. The veteran benefits bill that was passed in September 2015 provides $79.7 billion in discretionary funding for military construction and veterans programs, about $7.9 billion more than in the previous fiscal year, The Hill reports .

"Obama Pulls $2.6 Billion from Vets for Refugees-Fiction!","2015-11-12 12:46:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-pulls-2-6-billion-from-vets-for-refugees/"," President Obama has pulled $2.6 billion from veteran programs and has redirected it toward Syrian refugees. "," President Obama hasn’t pulled $2.6 billion from veteran programs to help support Syrian refugees. That rumor combines two stories that appear to be unrelated. In July 2015 it was reported that the Department of Veteran Affairs faced a $2.6 billion funding gap for the year. But Obama didn’t “pull” the $2.6 billion from veterans programs to support Syrian refugees. The military publication Stars and Stripes explains the $2.6 billion shortfall as such: The VA told lawmakers it is $2.6 billion short on funding because patients and appointments have ballooned over the past year. It wants to cover the shortfall by tapping into an emergency $10 billion Veterans Choice fund created by Congress last summer to provide outside health care to veterans who cannot get timely appointments at the VA. In order to correct the funding gap for veterans’ health care, House Republicans said they would work to allow the VA more flexibility so that it could move funds from other areas of its budget to health care, where it faced the $2.6 billion shortfall. In a separate story, White House press secretary Josh Ernest announced in September 2015 that the U.S. would give an additional $419 million in humanitarian assistance to those impacted by the Syrian civil war before the end of the year, bringing the 2015 total up to $1.6 billion, United Press International reports : The majority of new funding supports non-governmental organizations and the United Nations’ efforts in Syria, mostly through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Children’s Fund. The United States will have given more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian assistance since the start of the Syrian civil war by the fiscal year’s end. “Part of the new funding will respond to the 2015 appeals of $8.4 billion from the United Nations for Syria and the region,” the White House said in a statement. “It is important to note that even with this contribution, the UN appeals for humanitarian aid to address the crisis in Syria are only 38 percent funded, resulting in cutbacks to food and other essential services.” So, the rumor that Obama pulled $2.6 billion in funding for veterans and gave it to Syrian refugees is false. It combines to different (and unrelated) situations. To recap, the VA reported a $2.6 billion funding gap in 2015 because of higher health care costs than expected — not because Obama had “pulled” the funding for Syrian refugees. In response, lawmakers agreed to make the VA’s budget more flexible so that funds could be reallocated from other areas of the budget to cover health care costs. Then, four months later, the White House announced that it would allocate an additional $419 million in humanitarian aid to the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015, bringing the yearly total to $1.6 billion. That money was not drawn from veterans programs, which is contrary to what the rumor claims. ","Government"

"," Ben Carson has not proposed a new tax system based on sin. Ben Carson, a presidential hopeful on the Republican ticket in 2016, has proposed a Biblical-based tax system — but tax rates would not be established based on sin under that tax system. Rumors that Ben Carson proposed to base a new tax system on sin started after the first Republican debate in August 2015. In the debate, Carson was asked about his plans for tax policy. The candidate responded : We need a significantly changed taxation system. The one that I’ve advocated is based on tithing because I think God is a pretty fair guy. He said, “if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make, if you had a bumper crop you don’t owe me triple tithes, and if you’ve had no crop you don’t owe me no tithes at all.’ So there must be something inherently fair about that, and that’s why I’ve advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes. If you make $10, you pay $1. Everyone get’s treated the same way. You get rid of the deductions and loop holes.” Tithing is a biblical concept that is referenced throughout the Old Testament. The concept entails giving one-tenth of your belongings to God — not paying for the number of sins you have. Ben Carson hasn’t gone into great detail about his tax plan, but most experts agree that it amounts to a 10% flat tax. The rumor that Ben Carson had proposed a new tax system based on sin started with a fake news report that was published after the first GOP debate in August. Newslo, a website that describes itself as a “hybrid News/Satire platform,” reported that Carson wanted to create a “biblical sin-based tax program”: Asked to elaborate, Carson said: “Well, basically, the system would work something like this: taxes would be calculated at the end of each tax year, or fiscal period, we would decide that later on, and then a person’s earnings would be compared and weighed against the amount or number of sins they have committed during the said tax period. Basically, the number of sins a person commits would be translated into a tax.” As is often the case with satirical and fake news websites, some readers missed the satire and though that that Ben Carson actually wanted to create a biblical sin-based tax program, but that’s not the case.

That rumor started in March 2015 when conservative activist Susan Payne appeared on the Joe Miller Radio Show and the Mark Levin Show . After the president announced a series of executive actions on immigration , Payne said she secretly participated in a conference call with members of the White House Task Force on New Americans about future plans for immigration reform: …They said that once this was all finished, there should be another executive order that changes Thanksgiving to “Celebrate Immigrants Day.” I was about ready to blow my top. Payne didn’t indicate who was on the conference call, or who made the suggestion to ban Thanksgiving. When she was prodded about any resistance to the suggestion, Payne seemed to indicate that it was some sort of joke: They just thanked them for their suggestion. They laughed and thought it was a good idea and thanked them for their suggestion. To me, as an American, and as an American whose husband served in Vietnam, I’m offended by this stuff.

"," Trey Gowdy, a Republican assemblyman from South Carolina, has been accused of altering Benghazi documents — but he disputes those claims. Gowdy is the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, the congressional panel investigating an attack on a U.S. embassy in Benghazi that left four Americans dead. Trey Gowdy asserted in a letter that an email from Hillary Clinton to outside advisor Sidney Blumenthal contained the classified name of an informant that the intelligence community relies upon, stating, “ This information, the name of a human source, is some of the most protected information in our intelligence community, the release of which could jeopardize not only national security but human lives.” Rep. Elija Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the select committee, then wrote a letter requesting that Gowdy correct the record after the CIA confirmed that the name of the informant was not classified, “debunking” Gowdy’s claim. Cummings also accused Gowdy of altering a document by adding redactions to make it appear that Clinton had leaked confidential information: To further inflate your claim, you placed your own redactions over the name of the individual with the words, “redacted due to sources and methods.”  To be clear, these redactions were not made, and these words were not added, by any agency of the federal government responsible for enforcing classification guidelines. Predictably, commentators began repeating your accusations in even more extreme terms, suggesting in headlines for example that “Clinton Burns CIA Libya Contact.” Contrary to your claims, the CIA yesterday informed both the Republican and Democratic staffs of the Select Committee that they do not consider the information you highlighted in your letter to be classified.  Specifically, the CIA confirmed that “the State Department consulted with the CIA on this production, the CIA reviewed these documents, and the CIA made no redactions to protect classified information.” Trey Gowdy denied the claim that the CIA had “debunked” his claims about Hillary Clinton in a letter to Cummings . Gowdy also said that the executive branch, not the CIA, declassified the informant’s name: Contrary to your assertion, the CIA did not inform the committee that anything about the facts stated in the October 7 letter “(was) wrong.” As usual, I would ask you to completely and accurately relate the facts rather than attempt to create an impression that is misleading based on an incomplete and selection recitation of the facts. In fact, my understanding is the CIA advised the committee in a very brief email late Saturday night that it had reviewed the material in question and asked for no material to be redacted. In fact, the name of the alleged source was redacted from the material cleared for public release by someone in the executive branch…” So, it’s true that the ranking Democrat on the House Select Committee on Benghazi accused Trey Gowdy of misrepresenting facts and altering a document to paint Hillary Clinton in a negative light — but Gowdy has disputed those allegations. The CIA has declined to weigh-in publicly. ","Government"
"Government Could Withhold up to 30% from Social Security Checks in 2016-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-10-16 12:09:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/government-could-withhold-up-to-30-from-social-security-checks-in-2016/"," Those who receive Social Security will see a 30% reduction in benefits in 2016. "," Reports that a 30% cut could be coming to Social Security benefits checks are both true and false. First, many people have confused the difference between Social Security retirement benefits and Social Security disability benefits. Social Security retirement benefits , which are paid to retired adults who paid into the Social Security system for long enough to qualify, are not in danger of being cut by 30% in 2016. The government collects a 6.2% payroll tax from employees and employers, and 5.3% of that tax goes into the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund to pay Social Security retirement benefits. The possible 30% cut in 2016 applies only to Social Security disability insurance (DI), which pays benefits to about 11 million Americans who are severely disabled. The DI trust fund receives about 0.9% of the payroll tax collected by the government, and the Social Security disability insurance trust fund is in danger of being depleted by the end of 2016, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities : When lawmakers last redirected some payroll tax revenue from OASI to DI in 1994, they expected that step to keep DI solvent until 2016 given anticipated economic and demographic trends. Despite fluctuations in the meantime, current projections still anticipate depletion of the trust fund in 2016 as forecast. DI’s anticipated trust fund depletion does not indicate that the program is out of control or that it is “bankrupt;” if the trust fund were depleted and policymakers took no action, the program could still pay about 80 percent of benefits. But cutting benefits by one-fifth for an extremely vulnerable group of severely disabled Americans is unacceptable. DI’s finances should ideally be addressed in the context of legislation to restore overall Social Security solvency. But even if policymakers make progress toward a well-rounded solvency package before late 2016, which seems unlikely, any changes in DI benefits or eligibility would surely phase in gradually and hence do little to fully replenish the DI fund by 2016. Consequently, policymakers would still need to reallocate payroll tax revenues between the two programs. There is nothing novel or controversial in such a step, and failing to take it would be irresponsible. While some have predicted that Social Security disability benefit payments could be cut by as much as 30% if Congress doesn’t replenish the DI trust fund by the end of 2016, a report released in July 2016 found that the cuts would amount to about 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the New York Times reports : The trustees of Social Security, including three cabinet secretaries, said the disability trust fund would be depleted in the last quarter of 2016. After that, they said, benefits would automatically be cut by 19 percent because revenues, largely from payroll taxes, would be sufficient to cover only 81 percent of scheduled benefit payments. The report sets up a fight between President Obama and Republicans in Congress. Mr. Obama wants to replenish the disability trust fund by shifting some payroll tax revenues from Social Security’s retirement trust fund. Republicans, however, want more significant changes to improve the program’s finances. These changes could include reductions in disability benefits, restrictions on eligibility, new measures to combat fraud or new strategies to help people return to work. In January, Republicans adopted a new rule in the House that could block a direct reallocation of money at the expense of the trust fund that provides benefits for retirees. So, some of the claims about possible 30% cuts to Social Security disability insurance are true, and some are false. The exact amount of the cuts, which have been projected to be anywhere from 19-30%, is unknown. It’s also not known whether Congress will solve the problem before the Social Security disability insurance trust fund runs dry in 2016, which would trigger those cuts. ","Government"
"President Obama Bans Pork at Federal Prisons- Truth!","2015-10-13 13:22:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-bans-pork-at-federal-prisons/"," The Bureau of Prisons, which works at the behest of President Obama, has banned pork at federal prisons. "," It’s true that pork has been removed from federal prison menus. Pork was removed from federal prisons when the new fiscal year began in October. The fiscal year 2016 National Menu for America’s 206,000 federal inmates is pork-free. Many have questioned whether the decision to ban pork at federal prisons was made for religious reasons. Muslim prisoners that follow a halal diet are unable to eat pork. Jewish prisoners are also unable to eat pork because animals that don’t chew their cud or have split hooves aren’t considered kosher . But Edmund Ross, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, told the Washington Post that the decision to ban pork was based on a survey of prisoners’ food preferences. Ultimately the decision was made, Ross said, because pork wasn’t a popular meal choice, and it’s one of the most expensive to provide. “Why keep pushing food that people don’t want to eat?” Ross said . “Pork has been the lowest-rated food by inmates for several years.” In theory, pork could be the lowest-rated menu option because the religious beliefs of Muslim and Jewish prisoners make them rate it low among available food options — but that’s not the case. Eighty-five percent of the prisoners locked up in federal and state prisons across the U.S. identify as Christian, according to the PEW Research Center . There’s no way that a small minority of Muslim and Jewish prisoners could make pork the lowest-rated food for religious reasons alone. But Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said that it was hard to believe that a survey would find a majority of any population — let alone federal prisoners — who say they don’t want bacon: “We’re going to find out how this came about and go from there,” Warner said. “We wouldn’t rule out any options to resolve this.” He said the association “is still formulating our strategy” to reverse the prison decision, which the industry first learned about Monday when the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called for comment. So, it’s true that the Bureau of Prisons has banned pork at federal prisons. As of now, however, the only reason given for the change is that prisoners don’t like it. ","Government"

"After Requiring Voter ID, Alabama Closes DMV Locations in Black Counties-Truth!","2015-10-09 13:40:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/after-requiring-voter-id-alabama-closes-dmv-locations-in-black-counties/"," The Alabama Legislature has closed many DMV locations in majority black counties after passing a law that requires voters to show photo ID. "," It’s true that many DMV locations in areas where mostly black people live have been closed, and that Alabama has a law on the books that requires voters to show photo ID. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) announced on September 30, 2015, that 31 driver license offices would be closed due to an $11 million cut in state funding for the ALEA: An $11 million cut in the new General Fund appropriation to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) will force the elimination of travel to 31 part-time, non-state owned, satellite locations. Effective today, the traveling Driver License Examiners will be reallocated to staff District Driver License Offices full-time. The reallocation of the Driver License Examiners comes one day before the effective date of the General Fund Budget passed during a special legislative session. The appropriation to ALEA was reduced in the new budget from $55,758,744 to $44,640,937. “Since the Jan. 1, 2015 implementation date of ALEA, my staff and I have worked hard to make improvements and optimize customer convenience to the citizens of Alabama. In July, I announced several advancements that will help the Driver License issuance process including online scheduling, online driver license renewals and duplicates, self-serve kiosks, digital licensing for smart phones, and statewide equipment upgrades. Since making that announcement, we have had over 40,000 transactions online,” said Secretary of Law Enforcement Spencer Collier. “The impact of the changes due to the budget cuts will be lessened because of the implementation of these technology-based services, including online renewals.” John Archibald, a columnist for the Alabama Media Group, noted that the majority of Alabama’s driver’s license office closures were in places with majority black populations that had high voter turnout: Take a look at the 10 Alabama counties with the highest percentage of non-white registered voters. That’s Macon, Greene, Sumter, Lowndes, Bullock, Perry, Wilcox, Dallas, Hale, and Montgomery, according to the Alabama Secretary of State’s office. Alabama, thanks to its budgetary insanity and inanity, just opted to close driver license bureaus in eight of them. All but Dallas and Montgomery will be closed. Look at the 15 counties that voted for President Barack Obama in the last presidential election. The state just decided to close driver license offices in 53 percent of them. Look at the five counties that voted most solidly Democratic? Macon, Greene, Sumter, Lowndes and Bullock counties all had their driver license offices closed. Look at the 10 that voted most solidly for Obama? Of those, eight – again all but Dallas and the state capital of Montgomery – had their offices closed. Because Alabama enacted a photo ID requirement for voters in 2011, many believed that the closures would make it more difficult for residents in those areas to renew or obtain an ID card or driver’s license. One of those people was Alabama state Rep. Terri Sewell, who requested that U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch launch an investigation into the closures: “It is disappointing, and unconscionable that Alabama would heighten its requirements to vote without also increasing the available options to meet these requirements. Closing 31 driver’s license offices across the state only heightens the disparities in voting between low-income and higher-income communities, and would disproportionately impact the residents of the 7th Congressional District.  These closures will potentially disenfranchise Alabama’s poor, elderly, disabled and black communities. “My constituents are the least able, and least likely to have access to transportation – either public or private – and thus travel across county lines for a driver’s license.

"President Obama Has Ordered “Behavior Experiments” on Americans-Mostly Fiction!","2015-09-18 14:42:44","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-has-ordered-behavior-experiments-on-americans/"," President Obama has ordered behavioral experiments to be carried out on the American public through an executive order. "," It’s true that President Obama signed an executive order encouraging federal agencies and departments to use behavioral insights when making policy decisions. And it’s also true that behavioral insights can be gleaned through experimentation, but those two things have been patched together to create a fictional narrative that the executive order authorizes mass “behavioral experimentation” on Americans. Those rumors spread across blog sites after the president signed the executive order calling for the use of “behavioral science insights to better serve the American people.” These blog sites replaced the term “behavioral sciences” with the more ominous-sounding term “behavioral experiments” — but that term doesn’t actually appear anywhere in the executive order. The word “experimentation” does, however, appear in the definition of behavioral sciences in the Psychology Dictionary: A scientific discipline which studies the actions and interactions of organisms, particularly humans and animals. These activities are monitored through observational and experimental means, and they may be observed under natural or controlled conditions. This branch of science includes studies like psychology, psychiatry, sociology, biology, anthropology, psychopharmacology, etc. That led websites like D.C. Clothesline to report that Obama had instructed federal agencies to “conduct mass behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens,” and to liken the move to the rise of Nazi Germany: Obamabots, liberals, and individuals intent on destroying this nation’s republic form of government will cheer for the “behavioral experimentation” on everyone. It’s a way to use behavioral altering methods to brainwash the populace to accept the socialist/dictator agenda. Face facts friends, the citizens of this nation are nothing more than mice in a maze, Pavlov’s dog, or mice in a glass cage to study to the ones occupying elected positions and positions of power in Washington, DC. Through the executive order, however, Obama “encouraged” federal agencies and departments to “identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness.” There’s no mention of behavioral experiments. The overall purpose of the executive order is stated: To more fully realize the benefits of behavioral insights and deliver better results at a lower cost for the American people, the Federal Government should design its policies and programs to reflect our best understanding of how people engage with, participate in, use, and respond to those policies and programs. By improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities, including helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. The executive order also states that the behavioral insights policy will be unrolled through the National Science and Technology Council’s Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST), which was launched in January 2014 to “better serve the nation while saving taxpayer dollars.” The SBST has carried out a number of pilot projects over the last year, many of which have used behavioral science to make government communications more effective: SBST had a successful first year, launching a wide variety of evidence-based pilots with objectives ranging from connecting veterans with employment and educational counseling benefits to helping struggling student borrowers understand their loan repayment options. In one recent pilot, SBST collaborated with the Department of Defense (DOD) to help members of the Armed Forces continue contributions to their Roth Thrift Savings Plans. Due to a change in the military pay system in January 2015, nearly 140,000 members needed to re-enroll in their plans online, or else their contributions would be suspended indefinitely. SBST worked with DOD to redesign their planned communications to better serve our service members, by making the language clear and concise, charting out clear action steps for service members to take, and personalizing the emails. Results from the first week of the pilot indicated that the redesigned email led 22% more service members – 3,770 individuals – to re-enroll compared to the original message. Since the redesigned email was more effective at prompting re-enrollment after just one week, DOD sent a version of the redesigned email to the entire population in follow-up messages, demonstrating the rapid scalability of insights from these types of low-cost pilots. So, it’s true that Obama has “encouraged” federal departments and agencies to use behavioral sciences when possible, but claims that the president has ordered behavioral experiments on Americans are fictional.

"Judge Tonya Parker Refuses to Perform Heterosexual Marriages-Previously Truth! Now Resolved!","2015-09-08 11:13:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/judge-tonya-parker-refuses-to-perform-heterosexual-marriages/"," Dallas County Judge Tonya Parker refused to perform marriage ceremonies until homosexuals were allowed to wed. "," It’s true that Judge Tonya Parker refused to perform marriage ceremonies back in 2012, but she has started performing them again. Judge Tonya Parker said that she would not perform any legal marriage ceremonies in her courtroom until homosexual couples were allowed to wed back in February 2012. During an address to the Stonewall Democrats of Dallas, Parker said “I use it as my opportunity to give them a lesson about marriage inequality in this state because I feel like I have to tell them why I’m turning them away. So I usually will offer them something along the lines of, ‘I’m sorry. I don’t perform marriage ceremonies because we are in a state that does not have marriage equality, and until it does, I am not going to partially apply the law to one group of people that doesn’t apply to another group of people.’ And it’s kind of oxymoronic for me to perform ceremonies that can’t be performed for me, so I’m not going to do it.” Judge Tonya Parker kept her pledge for three years. She didn’t perform a courtroom wedding until June 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state bans on same-sex marriages were unconstitutional. After Parker married a same-sex couple that had been together for 28 years, she said , “The decision today represents an opportunity where I can now marry couples that come to the courtroom, like any other judge.” Tonya Parker, who is openly gay, has served as a judge since 2010. She was last elected to the 101st District Court seat in 2014. Reports of Tonya Parker’s refusal to perform marriage ceremonies went viral after Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, was jailed for contempt of court after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Comparisons between Tonya Parker and Kim Davis have sparked controversy because Davis was jailed for her stand, and Parker was not. A similar situation that played out in Oregon helps explain why. Many questioned why Vance Day, a county judge from Oregon, wasn’t thrown in jail for contempt of court after he refused to perform same-sex weddings, Oregon Live reports : “The clerk in Kentucky is required to issue marriages license,” Washington County Senior Judge Gayle Nachtigal said Friday. “That’s part of her job.” For an Oregon judge, the situation isn’t so clear. State law allows a wide range of officiants at marriage ceremonies. Among those allowed to conduct such proceedings, are state judges, federal judges, county clerks and religious congregations Legal experts agree that judges here aren’t required to perform weddings. But if they do, can they choose not to officiate for some couples? “Whether they could decide, ‘I’m not going to marry same-sex couples, interracial couples, or a very young person to a very old person,'” Nachtigal said, “I don’t know that that would be allowed ultimately.” If a judge offers officiating services to the public, but only some of the public, “that’s when it starts to look like state-sanctioned discrimination,” said Mat dos Santos, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon. If a judge stopped performing all weddings to avoid officiating for gay couples, dos Santos said, that would be disappointing but probably the most legally defensible practice. So, Tonya Parker’s refusal to conduct wedding ceremonies held up for two reasons. First, judges aren’t required by law to perform marriages, they’re optional. Second, Tonya Parker refused to officiate all weddings — not just a particular type of wedding. ","Government"
"Maine Welfare Reforms Have Led to Big Welfare Declines-Mostly Fiction!","2015-08-25 17:41:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/maine-welfare-reforms-have-led-to-big-welfare-declines/"," Blog sites are reporting that reforms made to Maine’s welfare program have led to a massive reduction in the number of people who collect welfare in the state. "," Maine has made a number of welfare reforms in recent years, but claims about the impact they’ve had on welfare numbers in the state have been exaggerated or are incorrect. Maine Gov. Paul LePage made welfare reform a key issue in his 2014 reelection campaign, but the reform that has made the biggest impact in the state took effect before Gov. LePage’s re-election. In July 2014, Gov. LePage announced that Maine would no longer seek a federal waiver that allowed some able-bodied adults to receive food stamps without meeting minimum work requirements. That means those who receive food stamps in Maine have to work 20 hours a week, volunteer at a community agency or enroll in a vocational program, the Portland Press Herald reports : (The Maine Department of Health and Human Services) has identified 12,000 current recipients in Maine who fit that definition. They represent about 5 percent of all food stamp recipients and collectively receive about $15 million per year in benefits, or about 4.4 percent of all food stamp dollars that come to Maine. It’s not known how many of these would fail to satisfy the work requirement. By April 2015, Maine had seen a “dramatic drop” in able-bodied adults on food stamps. In the first four months of 2015, the number of able-bodied adults on food stamps in the state had dropped 70%, from 12,000 to 2,680. Still, the claim that Maine welfare reform has led to a “nearly 80% reduction in welfare” isn’t true. It led to a 70% reduction in able-bodied adults who receive food stamps — who made up about 5% of all food stamp recipients before the reform took effect. So, a claim making its way around the blogosphere that Maine has seen an 80% reduction in welfare recipients is false. And a number of Maine’s welfare reforms sited in these blog posts have only been in effect for months, so their impact isn’t yet known. In April 2015, for example, Maine started drug screening some recipients of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family program (commonly known as TANF) who had criminal records. By June 2015, just 15 recipients had drug screenings scheduled. Thirteen didn’t show up, and one failed the drug test, the Associated Press reports . In June 2015, Gov. LePage said Maine would move forward with a plan to cut off general assistance benefits to illegal aliens and undocumented immigrants. DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew estimated the plan would affect about 1,000 people and would save the state about $1 million a year, the Portland Press Herald reports . So those welfare reforms may reduce the number of beneficiaries in the state at some point, but they haven’t been around long enough to make a difference. ","Government"
"Nuclear Deal Sends $150 Billion to Iran-Mostly Truth!","2015-08-17 13:56:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nuclear-deal-sends-150-billion-to-iran/"," Donald Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that a nuclear deal with Iran would send $150 billion to Iran, even if it’s not approved by Congress. "," This one is mostly true, but some of the details are a little fuzzy. Donald Trump said that the $150 billion would go to Iran even if Congress didn’t approve the nuclear deal during an August 16 appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “The problem is by the time I get in there, they will have already receive the $150 billion. Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn’t believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich.” Under the nuclear deal, Iran would have access to billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign accounts due to previous nuclear sanctions. But the exact amount of Iran’s windfall, and the idea that Iran would get the assets even if Congress doesn’t approve the deal, aren’t sure things. Sanctions placed on Iran because of its nuclear program froze billions of dollars of Iran’s assets in foreign accounts. The nuclear deal would unfreeze those accounts, which the White House has estimated could send up to $150 billion to Iran. But Obama administration officials said that Iran wouldn’t receive the full $150 billion in frozen assets because the country owes billions to China and other countries. After repaying those debts, Iran would receive about $56 billion. Others have argued that Iran would leave the $150 billion in foreign accounts because repatriating it could hurt its economy, the Daily Beast reports : The money is unlikely to be repatriated back to Iran. Administration officials and critics alike predict that Iran will keep much of its assets overseas, since a sudden influx of funds into the country could drive up the cost of the Iranian currency, making it more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase Iranian goods and services. “It’s already in foreign accounts, so it’s not part of the normal budgeting process. It’s just ready cash… so you can start distributing it abroad very easily,” said Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Michael Doran. “It would be very easy for them not to repatriate it.” Also, the idea that the nuclear deal would send $150 billion to Iran even if Congress doesn’t approve it isn’t necessarily a given. Other countries would have to lift sanctions on Iran even if the U.S. doesn’t for that to happen. So, some of the details are up in the air, but the claim that the nuclear deal could send up to $150 billion to Iran is mostly true. ","Government"

"," Congress hasn’t passed a law that will send unemployed mothers to jail. That rumor started with an “entertainment” website called FammTV. The website published a blog that said unemployed mothers would be sent to jail under the new law for child neglect: Reportedly Congress will soon pass a law that all mothers without employment must have some source of  employment before August 2016. As it was reported after a recent Congress meeting, mothers are no longer allowed to sit at home and collect government assistance. Mother must show that there is some other way they can provide for their children besides assistance from the Government. If they can not provide some kind of employment information, mothers will be served and will have to explain to a judge why they feel the need to not work and collect free benefits. The U.S. board of welfare is willing to help mothers with sources that will hire them. Congress may have already agreed reportedly, that mothers who haven’t work for a span of 6 years or longer may served up to 15-30 days in a correctional facility, if a judge find that they haven’t made an valid effort to find employment. A mother who does not look to be able to financially support their child/children display a form of neglect. Without having a medical reason to not be employed, Congress believe 6 years is a reasonable amount of time for anyone to be able to find a job. Even if a person decides to go to school for 4 years every individual will have an additional 2 years to find employment. This new law will also cater to those who chose to further there education. This new law is not designed to separate children from their homes, but it will let us take a look at what’s going on in certain individuals households and allow us to make an reasonable assessment to determined if that household is healthy for that child/children. The plan is more so to help individuals find employment rather than to evade on the privacy of U.S. citizens. The website’s blog appears to be user-generated by a community of readers. The website’s contact page says members are encouraged to create content that is “real as can be,” but that’s much of a guarantee.

Let’s take a look at claims that have frequently appeared: John Kerry’s Daughter Married an Iranian- Mostly Fiction! John Kerry’s daughter married a man of Iranian descent, but he was born and raised in America. Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Vanessa was practicing internal medicine there, and Nahed was practicing neurological surgery, according to a New York Times wedding announcement : The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale.

As you gather with your loved ones around the Sofreh Haft-Seen, we are proud to note that many Americans will join you in celebrating Nowruz. This year, we are once again reminded of the outstanding contributions of Iranian-Americans and Iranian students here in the United States, which reflect the rich history of your culture. I am proud of the Iranian-Americans in my own family, and grateful for how they have enriched my life. Kerry made the admission after a website operated by the Iranian government reported that his son-in-law was an Iranian-American and had still relatives in Iran. The report was published as Kerry faced a Senate confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, so it wasn’t a “secret.” Kenneth Timmerman, president of the Foundation for Democracy in Iran, described the timing of Kerry’s statement in a column that appeared in the Daily Caller : Was the Iranian publication itself a subtle form of blackmail, aimed at letting Kerry know that the regime is fully aware of his son-in-law’s extended family in Iran? The Islamic Republic systematically puts pressure on family members of prominent Iranian-Americans (for example, individuals who work at the Persian service of Voice of America), to make sure that they do not engage in hostile statements or activities against the Tehran regime. Certainly, Secretary Kerry has long favored a U.S. rapprochement with the Islamic Republic. He has repeatedly appeared with groups such as the American Iranian Council (AIC), and has taken money from Iranian-Americans for his political campaigns, including at least one illegal donation from an Iranian woman who did not have a green card. So he didn’t need to have an Iranian-American family member to believe that the United States should forge direct relations with the Islamic Republic or ease U.S. pressure on the regime. Kerry may have figured that by revealing the family tie himself he could diffuse the situation, and make it more difficult for the regime to put pressure on his son-in-law’s family. Of course, that’s assuming Kerry in fact plans to do anything that angers the regime. Besides, the New York Times ran a wedding announcement in 2009 that quoted Kerry, so it wouldn’t have been a very well guarded secret. The Son of an Iranian Foreign Minister Was the Best Man in John Kerry’s Daughter’s Wedding- Reported as Fiction! There’s no proof that this one is true. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The rumor that Zarif’s son was the best man in Kerry’s daughter’s wedding started with a post on Allen B. West’s website in July 2015: Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry’s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif’s son. The story doesn’t cite a source, but Vanessa Kerry Nahed quickly shot the rumor down. She tweeted that her husband didn’t have a best man because they didn’t have a bridal party at their wedding. An Iranian news agency called the report a “news fabrication” and said Zarif’s son wasn’t at the wedding. According to the report : Officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry’s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif’s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed’s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry’s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning. It is true, however, that Kerry has a personal relationship with Zarif that predates the nuclear talks. The diplomats’ relationship was reported in a 2012 book by author Hooman Majd . ","Government"
"President Obama Didn’t Lower Flags for Chattanooga Shooting-Truth! & Outdated!","2015-07-28 09:47:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-didnt-lower-flags-for-chattanooga-shooting/"," Social media posts question why President Obama didn’t issue a proclamation to lower flags to half mast after four servicemen were killed at a military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. "," It’s true that President Obama didn’t initially order flags lowered after four military recruiters were killed in mass shootings in Chattanooga. But after public backlash, President Obama later issued a proclamation to fly flags on federal grounds at half staff to honor the servicemen who lost their lives. President Obama called for the flags to be lowered on July 21. That was five days after a man named Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez opened fire at two military installations in Chattanooga, killing four servicemen. The proclamation reads : HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE TRAGEDY IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION Our thoughts and prayers as a Nation are with the service members killed last week in Chattanooga.  We honor their service.  We offer our gratitude to the police officers and first responders who stopped the rampage and saved lives.  We draw strength from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try and do us harm:  We do not give in to fear.  You cannot divide us. And you will not change our way of life. We ask God to watch over the fallen, the families, and their communities.  As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on July 16, 2015, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, July 25, 2015.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth. Barack Obama There isn’t a clear policy for when flags are lowered to half-staff after national tragedies. But in the past, President Obama has ordered that flags be flown at half staff after mass shootings, including shootings at military installations, the Washington Post reports : On the issue of lowering the flags, Obama seemed to hear the mounting Republican criticism and respond to it. There are no clear or consistent rules that apply to lowering flags to half-staff. Obama ordered flags lowered after the mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009 but didn’t lower them when a gunman struck last year at the Army post in Texas. He has lowered flags almost immediately after mass shootings in Tucson; Aurora, Colo.; Newtown, Conn.; Oak Creek, Wis.; and the Washington Navy Yard. He has ordered flags to half-staff after the deaths of American icons such as Neil Armstrong, Edward M. Kennedy, Dorothy Height and Frank Buckles, the nation’s last surviving World War I veteran. But he didn’t lower the flag after last month’s shooting in Charleston, S.C. Controversy over when flags are lowered after the deaths of public figures isn’t new, either. In February 2014, reports went viral that President Obama ordered flags to half staff after the death of Whitney Houston — but not for Shirley Temple Black. In truth, Obama issued no such proclamation. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered flags to half-staff in New Jersey, where Whitney Houston was from, after her death.

"Obama Changes Oath of Allegiance for New Americans-Mostly Fiction!","2015-07-28 08:08:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-changes-oath-of-allegiance-for-new-americans-2/"," President Obama has changed the Oath of Allegiance, and new naturalized citizens no longer have to pledge that they’ll take up arms to defend the U.S. "," President Obama hasn’t changed the Oath of Allegiance. But there has been proposed guidance that would clarify who’s allowed to take an alternate oath under current law. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has long allowed exceptions and accommodations for naturalized citizens who take the Oath of Allegiance. In July 2015, USCIS issued new guidance that laid out a three-part test to determine who qualifies for exceptions based on “religious training and belief, or for other reasons of good conscience.” That led to viral reports that President Obama had changed the Oath of Allegiance so naturalized citizens no longer have to pledge to take up arms to defend the U.S. But in truth, current law already provides that exemption. New naturalized citizens have been taking the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America since the country was founded. Before 1906, however, there wasn’t a specific text for the oath, and the only guidance was that the applicant: “…shall…declare, on oath…that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to every foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty; and, particularly, by name, to the prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of which he was before a citizen or subject; which proceedings shall be recorded by the clerk of the court.” The Naturalization Act of 1906 was the first step toward changing that. It standardized the naturalization process, required that applicants had “some knowledge of the English language” and established the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization to oversee immigration. After World War I and World War II, immigration and naturalization were viewed as national security issues. Previous naturalization laws were consolidated under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to reflect that. The University of Washington-Bothell summarizes the law : Otherwise known as the McCarran-Walter Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was meant to exclude certain immigrants from immigrating to America, post World War II and in the early Cold War. The McCarran-Walter Act moved away from excluding immigrants based simply upon country of origin. Instead it focused upon denying immigrants who were unlawful, immoral, diseased in any way, politically radical etc. and accepting those who were willing and able to assimilate into the US economic, social, and political structures, which restructured how immigration law was handled. Furthermore, the most notable exclusions were anyone even remotely associated with communism which in the early days of the Cold War was seen as a serious threat to US democracy. The main objective of this was to block any spread of communism from outside post WWII countries, as well as deny any enemies of the US during WWII such as Japan and favor “good Asian” countries such as China. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 set a number of guidelines for the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, but it didn’t spell out the oath’s text. Key points of the guidance include: -Support the Constitution; -Renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the applicant was before a subject or citizen; -Support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; -Bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; -Perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; or -Perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law. Today, the text of the Oath of Allegiance can be found in federal codes : I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. These federal codes also outline the alternate version that has been incorrectly attributed to Obama: (b) Alteration of form of oath; affirmation in lieu of oath. In those cases in which a petitioner or applicant for naturalization is exempt from taking the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in its entirety, the inapplicable clauses shall be deleted and the oath shall be taken in such altered form. When a petitioner or applicant for naturalization, by reason of religious training and belief (or individual interpretation thereof), or for other reasons of good conscience, cannot take the oath presc ribed in paragraph (a) of this section with the words “on oath” and “so help me God” included, the words “and solemnly affirm” shall be substituted for the words “on oath,” the words “so help me God” shall be deleted, and the oath shall be taken in such modified form. Any reference to “oath of allegiance” in this chapter is understood to mean equally “affirmation of allegiance” as described in this paragraph. So, President Obama has not changed the Oath of Allegiance for new Americans. Naturalized citizens were already able under law to omit portions of the oath based on “religious training and belief, or for other reasons of good conscience.” USCIS did, however, issue new guidance that “clarifies the eligibility requirements for modifications” of the oath under current law with a three-part test : Three-part Test In order for an applicant to qualify for a modification based on his or her “religious training and belief,” the applicant must satisfy a three-part test. An applicant must establish that: -He or she is opposed to bearing arms in the armed forces or opposed to any type of Service in the armed forces. -The objection is grounded in his or her religious principles, to include other belief systems similar to traditional religion or a deeply held moral or ethical code; and -His or her beliefs are sincere, meaningful, and deeply held. The applicant is not eligible for a modified oath when he or she is opposed to a specific war. Religious training or belief does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views. An applicant whose objection to war is based upon opinions or beliefs about public policy and the practicality or desirability of combat, or whose beliefs are not deeply held, does not qualify for the modification of the oath. Applicant is Not Required to Belong to a Church or Religion In addition, qualification for the exemption is not dependent upon membership in a particular religious group, nor does membership in a specific religious group provide an automatic modification to the oath. The applicant is not required to: -Belong to a specific church or religious denomination; -Follow a particular theology or belief; or -Have religious training. However, the applicant must have a sincere and meaningful belief that has a place in the applicant’s life that is equivalent to that of a religious belief. Because of this belief, for example, the applicant’s conscience may not rest or be at peace if allowed to become an instrument of war. So, in conclusion, Obama hasn’t changed the Oath of Allegiance. Immigration Services has issued guidance to clarify who is eligible to take an alternate version that was already on the books. USCIS is accepting public comment on these proposed changes through August 4, 2015. Click here for information on how to provide feedback. ","Government"
"Confederate Soldiers Are Considered U.S. Veterans Under Federal Law-Truth!","2015-07-23 07:51:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/confederate-soldiers-are-considered-u-s-veterans-under-federal-law/"," Confederate soldiers are officially considered American veterans and have the same protections as Union soldiers because of an act of Congress called Public Law 810 and other federal laws. "," It’s true that Union and Confederate soldiers are considered U.S. veterans under federal law, and that they would be entitled to the same benefits as Union soldiers today. These claims went viral on social media after the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina Capitol grounds in July 2015. The state legislature voted to remove the flag after a self-described white supremacist murdered nine black churchgoers there. That inspired posts on social media sites that claimed Confederate and Union veterans were considered equals under federal law, and that they are entitled to the same protections and benefits. It’s true that a federal law passed in 1958 listed the spouses and children of all Civil War veterans — Confederate and Union — as eligible for federal pensions: Whenever there is no surviving spouse entitled to pension under section 1532 of this title, the Secretary shall pay to the children of each Civil War veteran who met the service requirements of section 1532 of this title a pension at the monthly rate of $73.13 for one child, plus $8.13 for each additional child, with the total amount equally divided. It’s also true that federal law (formerly Public Law 810) makes Confederate soldiers eligible for burial in national cemeteries and for taxpayer-funded headstones, just like Union soldiers: The Secretary shall furnish, when requested, an appropriate memorial headstone or marker for the purpose of commemorating an eligible individual whose remains are unavailable. Such a headstone or marker shall be furnished for placement in a national cemetery area reserved for that purpose under section 2403 of this title, a veterans’ cemetery owned by a State, or, in the case of a veteran, in a State, local, or private cemetery. The last known Civil War veteran died in 1956, and the last known widow of a Civil War veteran died in 2003 at age 93. But there were surprisingly two children of Civil War veterans who were still receiving benefits in 2012, U.S. News reports : In the 19th and early 20th centuries, only Union soldiers were eligible for military benefits. It wasn’t until the 1930s that confederate soldiers began receiving pensions from the federal government. Prior to that, confederate soldiers could apply for benefits through the state they resided in. The groundwork for reconciliation, however, was laid decades before Confederate soldiers and family members became available for federal benefits. President William McKinley cited reconciliation between the North and South in a speech that followed the conclusion of the Spanish American War on December 14, 1898. A number of former Confederate officers had volunteered for service during the war, which had helped secure U.S. victory, McKinley said: … Every soldier’s grave made during our unfortunate Civil War is a tribute to American valor. And while, when those graves were made, we differed widely about the future of this government, those differences were long ago settled by the arbitrament of arms; and the time has now come, in the evolution of sentiment and feeling under the providence of God, when in the spirit of fraternity we should share with you in the care of the graves of the Confederate soldiers. The Cordial feeling now happily existing between the North and South prompts this gracious act, and if it needed further justification, it is found in the gallant loyalty to the Union and the flag so conspicuously shown in the year just past by the sons and grandsons of these (Spanish American War veterans). What a glorious future awaits us if united, wisely, and bravely we face the new problems now pressing upon us, determined to solve them for right and humanity. That flag has been planted in two hemispheres, and there it remains the symbol of liberty and law, of peace and progress. Who will withdraw from the people over whom it floats its protecting folds? Who will haul it down? Answer me, ye men of the South, who is there in Dixie who will haul it down? McKinley called for federal recognition of Union and Confederate soldiers because he viewed them all as Americans. But the Confederate flag wasn’t a part of McKinley’s reconciliation efforts, and he specifically cites the flying of the American flag in the south as reason to move forward with federal recognition of Confederate soldiers. The Confederate flag didn’t fly widely in the south until the 1940s, the Atlantic reports: After the surrender in 1865, Confederate flags were folded and put away. They were most likely to be spotted at memorials or cemeteries. Even after the hopeful decade of Reconstruction gave way to the violent repression of Redemption, open displays of the flag remained rare. There was no need for a banner to signal defiance; Jim Crow reigned unchallenged. The flag slowly crept back into public life over the ensuing decades, saluted at veterans’ reunions, promoted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, even carried into battle by units from the South. By the mid-twentieth century, the flags were also waved by football fans, and sold to tourists. But as a political symbol, the flag was revived when northern Democrats began to press for an end to the South’s system of racial oppression. In 1948, the Dixiecrats revolted against President Harry Truman—who had desegregated the armed forces and supported anti-lynching bills. The movement began in Mississippi in February of 1948, with thousands of activists “shouting rebel yells and waving the Confederate flag,” as the Associated Press reported at the time. Some actually removed old, mothballed flags from the trunks where they had until then been gathering dust. So, it’s true that Confederate and Union soldiers are considered equal under federal law, but critics argue that the same isn’t true of the American and Confederate flags. ","Government"
"The True Military Record of John McCain-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-07-23 07:48:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-true-military-record-of-john-mccain/"," A viral email that claims to tell about “the true military record of John McCain” argues that the Arizona senator isn’t a true war hero. "," Claims about John McCain’s fall can be classified as “all of the above.” They’re true, false and unproven. Many of these claims surfaced during the 2008 presidential election. Then, the rumors resurfaced in July 2015 after Donald Trump, a 2016 presidential contender, said McCain was only considered a war hero because he had been captured during the Vietnam War. That idea first appeared in a blog post titled, “The True Military Record of John McCain, Written By an Active Marine” in 2008. But the so-called “active Marine” that penned the blog is unnamed, so we can’t verify its authorship. Everyone’s definition of a “war hero” varies, but the blog post makes a number of direct accusations about McCain’s war record that can be fact checked and verified: McCain Became Squadron Commander Because of Family Connections- Fiction! It’s not true that John McCain was “promoted to squadron commander of the airfield named after his own grandfather immediately after crashing his third airplane.” McCain was promoted to squadron commander at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1976 — after he spent five years in captivity at the “Hanoi Hilton” in North Vietnam. Also, the crash in North Vietnam was his fifth crash as an airman, not his third. The claim that Cecil Airfield was named after his grandfather is also false. McCain’s paternal grandfather’s name was John McCain Sr ., and his maternal grandfather was named Archie Wright . However, McCain’s father and grandfather were both decorated airmen. McCain Was Awarded 28 Medals After Spending 20 Hours in Combat- Unproven! & Fiction! There’s no record of exactly how many hours McCain spent flying combat missions in the Vietnam War. He was, however, shot down and captured while flying his 23rd combat mission on October 26, 1967. Also, the Navy unsealed John McCain’s military record in 2008, and it revealed that he had received 17 awards and decorations during his career — not 28, as the eRumor claims: McCain attended the U.S. Naval Academy from 1954 to 1958, and was commissioned as an ensign in June of that year. He retired in April 1981 with the rank of captain. In that time he received 17 awards and decorations. Besides the Silver Star Medal, McCain also received the Legion of Merit with a combat “V” and one gold star, a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Bronze Star Medal with a combat “V” and two gold stars. Several citations mention his achievements either as a prisoner or as a lieutenant commander flying bombing runs off the deck of the USS Oriskany. Some are signed by then-Secretary of the Navy John Warner, who would become a colleague of McCain’s in the Senate. The citation for his Distinguished Flying Cross sums up McCain’s misfortune the following day: “Although his aircraft was severely damaged, he continued his bomb delivery pass and released his bombs on the target. When the aircraft would not recover from the dive, Commander McCain was forced to eject over the target.” Years later, as his Navy career approached its end, McCain received the Legion of Merit Medal. By then, his missions were in the halls of Congress as a liaison to the Senate from the Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs. He was praised for providing Navy leaders “with sage advice and sound judgment for enacting critical legislation during a period of severe fiscal constraint.” McCain Finished Near the Bottom of His Class at the U.S. Naval Academy- Truth! It’s true that John McCain graduated near the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. Some reports say that he graduated 790th out of 795 students. McCain alluded to his academic record there during a commencement speech in 1997: This is quite an unexpected honor for a Naval Academy midshipman who graduated fifth from the bottom in the Class of ’58. All those years ago, when I was a midshipman, I indulged in the normal daydreams of a young man about what kind of honors awaited me later in life. These rumors about John McCain’s military records aren’t likely to go away anytime soon, but some have persisted for years even though they can easily be proven false. ","Government"
"Christian Couples Stage Mass Divorces to Protest Gay Marriage Ruling-Fiction!","2015-07-13 14:09:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/christian-couples-stage-mass-divorces-to-protest-gay-marriage-ruling/"," A procession of Christian couples has filed for divorce to protest the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2015 ruling on gay marriage. "," There haven’t been any confirmed cases of Christian couples filing for divorce to protest the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage. That report was started by United Media Publishing , a website that publishes a combination of real and fake news. After the Supreme Court ruled that bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional, the website (falsely) reported : Thousands of Christian couples, some who have been married for decades, have vowed to file for divorce in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling which has legalized gay marriage nationwide. Adam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. “We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs.” Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. “I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. It’s unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satan’s agenda.” The story was quickly shared more than 56,000 times on social media sites. Many believed it to be true, but a closer look reveals a number of false claims. First, there’s no record of group called “Christ in Family Services” located in Topeka, Kansas. The group also doesn’t have an online footprint outside of the United Media Publishing report. The report also cites a so-called employee of “Calvin and Hays Family Court” in San Diego, which doesn’t exist. All divorce proceedings in the San Diego area go through the San Diego County Family Law Courthouse . At least one coupled did, however, actually threaten to divorce in protest of a gay marriage ruling. Nick and Sarah Jensen, high school sweethearts from Australia who had been married for 10 years, grabbed headlines when they made that threat in June 2015. But the Jensens threatened to divorce if gay marriage became legal in Australia — not the U.S. Besides, it was later reported that Australia’s Family Law Act would make it difficult for Nick and Sarah Jensen to symbolically divorce. The law requires couples to live separately for at least 12 months before a divorce is granted. So far, there haven’t been any confirmed cases of Christian couples actually divorcing in protest of the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. ","Government"

"," This is yet another hoax about so-called Islamic extremism in Dearborn, Michigan. The hoax was started by The People’s Cube , the fake news website that (falsely) reported that Rosie O’Donnel had gotten an ISIS tattoo. This time, the website reported that President Obama had signed an executive order to allow an ISIS-supporting Islamic youth outreach center to open in Dearborn: Following months of obstruction by state officials, the federal government intervened on behalf of a Muslim group who is outspokenly supportive of the Islamic State, to open the doors of a new Islamic youth outreach center in a lower-income area in the city of Dearborn. The facility will be run by Syrian-born Aisha Hani-Salaam, a recent immigrant and unapologetic supporter of ISIS. President Obama, who signed the executive order to allow the center, said, “We need to take advantage of every opportunity to end the violence between our people. Hopefully this will start a new era in relations between the United States and the religion of Islam. Muslims are understandably angry over the Western media’s overblown portrayal of ISIL as merciless killers. I believe this is a good opportunity to end the fighting and use diplomacy to usher in a new era of peace, as well as gain a powerful new ally in that part of the world.” Despite the President’s hopeful and reassuring message, Hani-Salaam remains angry and openly criticizes some American Muslims for their ‘lukewarm’ traditional condemnations of the United States. Within days of publication, the story had been shared more than 30,000 times on social media sites. Taken out of context, many were duped into believing the story was true. Dearborn has been at the center of a number of hoaxes about Islamic extremism. It’s a popular target because it has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world outside of the Middle East. About 100,000 people live in Dearborn, and about 40,000 of them are Arab-Americans. TruthorFiction.com has previously investigated false reports that Sharia law had been declared in Dearborn , and that a sign there warned Allah would kill America . The report that President Obama had signed an executive order to open an Islamic youth outreach center that supports ISIS is yet another hoax.

The website Real News, Right Now falsely reported that President Obama’s executive order would make it illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess Confederate flags: WASHINGTON, D.C. – During a White House-hosted dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan Monday evening, President Obama, flanked by select cabinet members, announced he has signed into law an executive order banning the manufacturing, distribution, and possession of Confederate flags and other memorabilia. “When our values are threatened, we come together as one nation,” Mr. Obama said. “As Americans, we insist that nobody should be targeted because of who they are, or what they look like, who they love, how they worship. We stand united against these hateful acts.” The executive order is the 209th issued by President Obama since taking office and is being hailed as a major victory against racism. Based largely on Germany’s anti-Nazi laws, the order, which officially goes into effect on June 18th, makes it illegal to possess “any item or symbol bearing the sign of the Confederacy.” President Obama, calling the Confederate flag a “symbol of hatred,” compared its history to that off the Third Reich, saying, “You don’t see government buildings in Germany flying the Nazi flag, we shouldn’t have to see the Confederate flag here.” The article also (falsely) reported that President Obama’s executive order would make possession of a Confederate flag a federal hate crime, and that South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had ordered the immediate removal of the Confederate flag from the state building to comply with the new federal law. According to the Federal Register , President Obama has signed no such executive order. And Nikki Haley has called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol building in South Carolina, but she didn’t order its immediate removal to comply with federal law.

"The U.S. Government Purchased 30,000 Guillotines-Fiction!","2015-06-24 17:21:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-u-s-government-purchased-30000-guillotines/"," The U.S. government recently purchased 30,000 guillotines after receiving congressional approval in 2013. "," Claims that the U.S. government has purchased thousands of guillotines have been around since at least 1994, but there’s not proof to back them up. The idea that the U.S. government had a secret stockpile of guillotines appeared in the 1994 book, “The Breaking Dead and Cement Children,” by Gyeorgos C. Hatonn. In the book, Hatonn references guillotines while arguing that Bo Gritz, a white separatist and former presidential candidate, was a secret government informant: Bo Gritz has been strongly denying to the people he leads that “there is not such thing as black, unmarked helicopters, UN troops, handcuffs, shackles and guillotines, or concentration camps.” These things do exist, a great deal of witnesses have reported these things. Bo Gritz denies in his newsletter that he is a CIA agent. Linda Thompson and Bill Cooper, who are to people exposing the NOW, both claim to have proof that he is a CIA agent. I don’t know that that is any secret. I heard Bo say on a radio interview here in Portland, “I am an intelligence agent.” So, claims that the U.S. government has secret concentration camps (also known as FEMA camps) stocked with guillotines have been around for years, even though there isn’t any hard evidence to back them up. The website Sharia Unveiled picked up the claim in 2013 and reported that the government had “recently” stockpiled 30,000 guillotines. Again, the report cites unnamed sources, bills that never became law and bills that don’t exist to make the case. The website claims that U.S. Congress had approved the use of guillotines for “government purposes,” but there’s no such law on the books. In 1996, the Georgia House of Representatives approved House Bill 1274 , which would have let prisoners on death row elect to die by guillotine — but it never became a law. The Georgia Senate never took up the bill , and it died. Besides, the stated purpose of the state bill wasn’t to execute people in federal FEMA camps. It would have allowed death row inmates who wanted to donate their organs to do so: (A bill) to amend Article 2 of Chapter 10 of Title 17 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to the death penalty generally, so as to provide a statement of legislative policy; to provide for death by guillotine; to provide for applicability; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes. The General Assembly finds that while prisoners condemned to death may wish to donate one or more of their organs for transplant, any such desire is thwarted by the fact that electrocution makes all such organs unsuitable for transplant. The intent of the General Assembly in enacting this legislation is to provide for a method of execution which is compatible with the donation of organs by a condemned prisoner. Sharia Unveiled also claimed that the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act is proof that the government has established FEMA prison camps where people will be executed by guillotine — but that bill never became law, either. It was referred to committee in 2013 and no action has been taken since. Claims that the government has purchased 30,000 guillotines and will use them in FEMA camps are false. The eRumor cites so-called first hand accounts, bills that don’t exist or never became law, and unnamed sources that can’t be verified — so there’s no reason to believe they’re true. ","Government"

"Louisiana House Bill 195 Bans Use of Cash-Previously Truth! But Now Resolved!","2015-05-11 22:50:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/louisiana-house-bill-195-bans-use-of-cash/"," Louisiana House Bill 195 makes it illegal to use cash to purchase second-hand goods in the state. "," This is an old story that was re-reported as breaking news four years after it was resolved. It’s true that Louisiana House Bill 195 made it illegal to use cash to purchase some second-hand items. But the measure was approved back in 2011, and the controversial parts were later taken out. Four years after House Bill 195 was initially approved, the website Government Slaves re-reported the story as “breaking news” in mid-2015: “Louisiana businesses are suddenly discovering a new law that flew under the radar during the last legislative session: “Cold hard cash. It’s good everywhere you go, right? You can use it to pay for anything. “But that’s not the case here in Louisiana now. It’s a law that was passed during this year’s busy legislative session. “House bill 195 basically says those who buy and sell second hand goods cannot use cash to make those transactions, and it flew so far under the radar most businesses don’t even know about it.” That story about the “criminalization of cash” was lifted directly from a 2011 report by KFLY, a local broadcaster in Baton Rouge, on the legislation’s impact on local second-hand dealers. Many blog sites picked up the story in 2015, and soon many readers believed that House Bill 195 had just been approved. Reports that cash had been criminalized in in Louisiana quickly went viral. Back in 2011, State Rep. Rickey Hardy said he had co-sponsored House Bill 195 to deter criminals from stealing and re-selling merchandise to second-hand dealers, “It’s a mechanism to be used so the police department has something to go on and have a lead.” Instead of cash, Hardy said, people could use checks, cashier’s checks or electronic transactions to purchase second-hand goods in the state. House Bill 195 was approved in July 2011 and it took effect in August 2011. Second-hand dealers who failed to comply with the bill three times or more could have been fined up to $10,000 and face up to five years in prison — but that didn’t stick. An amendment to House Bill 195 was approved in 2012 that struck the bill’s controversial parts. The amended version made the law apply only to businesses that purchase second-hand copper, which is frequently stolen from buildings and sold to scrap dealers. So, it’s legal to buy second-hand goods at flea markets, pawnshops and garage sales in Louisiana with cash, contrary to what the eRumor reports. ","Government"
"Texas Governor Deploys State Guard to Stave Off Obama Takeover – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-05-06 06:41:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/texas-governor-deploys-state-guard-to-stave-off-obama-takeover/"," Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed the State Guard to prevent a take over of the state by President Obama as a joint military exercise called Jade Helm 15 got underway. "," This claim is a mixture of truth and fiction. It’s true that Texas Governor Greg Abbot asked the State Guard to monitor the Jade Helm 15 joint military training exercise that was planned for Texas and five other states. However, reports that the Texas governor deployed the State Guard to “stave off” a federal takeover by President Obama is false. There has been a lot of speculation that Jade Helm 15 isn’t an innocent military training exercise. Conspiracy theories that claim Jade Helm 15 is actually an attempt to impose martial law, or to take over southern states, have run rampant on the Internet. TruthorFiction.com previously investigated these conspiracy theories about Jade Helm 15, and we didn’t find proof that it’s anyting more than a standard military training exercise. Click here for the story. Controversy about Jade Helm 15 boiled over on April 29, 2015, when 200 Texans raised questions about the exercise at a public meeting held in rural Bastrop County, Texas. Questions were raised about whether or not the government planned to confiscate weapons or impose martial law, the Associated Press reports : “Suspicions about Jade Helm intensified on some conservative websites and social media after a map labeled Texas, Utah and parts of California as ‘hostile’ for the purposes of the three-month training exercise that begins in July. Such war simulations aren’t unusual, though the Army has acknowledged that the size and scope of Jade Helm makes it unique.” In response to the strong public response, Texas Governor Greg Abbot requested in a letter that the State Guard “monitor” the training exercise, Reuters reports : “To address concerns of Texas citizens and to ensure that Texas communities remain safe, secure and informed about military procedures occurring in their vicinity, I am directing the Texas State Guard to monitor Operation Jade Helm 15. During the operation’s eight-week training period from July 2015 to September 2015, I expect to receive regular updates on the progress and safety of the operation. “During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed. By monitoring the operation on a continual basis, the State Guard will facilitate communications between my office and the commanders of the operation to ensure that adequate measure are in place to protect Texans. “U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has assured Texas that each location selected for training exercises will pose no risk to residents or property and that they will coordinate with local residents via verbal and written communication. “Directing the State Guard to monitor the operation will allow Texas to be informed of the details of military personnel movements and training schedules, and it will give us the ability to quickly and effectively communicate with local communities, law enforcement, public safety personnel and citizens.” Abbott states in the letter that the State Guard would primarily help his office and Texans communicate with the planners of Jade Helm 15. However, a report by NPR that appeared under the headline, “Texas Governor Deploys State Guard to Stave Off Obama Takeover,” seemed to fan the flames about a standoff between the White House and Texas. A White House spokesperson said that he had “no idea what (Abbott) was thinking” when he sent the letter: “The thing that I can say without having a lot of detailed knowledge about the particular exercise is that in no way will the constitutional rights or civil liberties of any American citizen be infringed upon while this exercise is being conducted.” Days later, the Texas governor appeared before reporters to defend his decision to have the State Guard monitor Jade Helm 15: “We are playing a pivotal role of government and that is to provide information to people who have questions. It’s clear that people in Bastrop had questions … I frankly think that there was an overreaction to the simple fact that someone has to be in charge of gathering and disseminating information and we stepped in to play that role, which is a role to be applauded. What the letter did was quite simple and non-inflammatory, and I think that’s the way it should be construed.” So, it’s true that Texas Governor Abbot directed the State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15 — but it’s not true that he deployed the State Guard to “stave off” a takeover by Obama.

"," A fake news website is behind this phony report. The story first appeared on a fake news website called the Habanero of Texas. The website, which describes itself as a “police ‘news source’ peppered with satire,” reported that: “The United States Supreme Court Ruled 9-0, today, that a police officer may not: stop, speak, walk by, or even look in the general direction of any person for any reason whatsoever, regardless if the cop believes the person has just committed murder or any other offense. This ruling comes on the cusp of public outrage over police arresting criminals for breaking an assortment of laws.” Many people who were unfamiliar with the fake news website were duped into believing that the “cops can’t stop” story was true. Like most satirical reports, this one is (very loosely) based in truth. Days before the eRumor went viral, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cops couldn’t extend traffic stops so that drug sniffing dogs could be brought in unless there was reasonable suspicion, the Washington Post reports . In another (somewhat) related case, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that cops couldn’t make traffic stops based on the color of a car. A man who was stopped after an officer noticed the unusual color of his car argued that the color of a car didn’t amount to probable cause for a traffic stop. Florida’s high court agreed . So, there are plenty of true “cops can’t stop” stories out there, but this particular eRumor is not one of them. ","Government"
"Drug Testing Leads to Mass Exodus of Welfare Recipients from Florida-Fiction!","2015-04-27 16:07:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/drug-testing-leads-to-mass-exodus-of-welfare-recipients-from-florida/"," Social media posts claim that a new law in Florida that requires welfare recipients to undergo drug tests has led to a mass exodus of welfare recipients from the state. "," Florida doesn’t require welfare recipients to undergo drug tests, so reports that the law would lead to a mass exodus of welfare recipients from the state are false. Back in 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott followed through on a campaign promise to sign a bill into law that would have required all welfare recipients in Florida to undergo a drug test. TruthorFiction.com previously reported that the bill had been tripped up by a number of lawsuits. Then, in March 2015, Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced that he wouldn’t challenge two federal court decisions that found the law unconstitutional. That effectively killed the bill. After Gov. Scott’s announcement, outdated chain emails and social media posts that claimed the bill would cause a mass exodus of welfare beneficiaries from the state resurfaced. That led many to believe that the bill had just become law, or that a mass exodus of welfare recipients from Florida had already begun. Even though the effort to drug test welfare recipients stalled in Florida, similar laws are on the books in other states. The National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) reported in February 2015 that 12 states (including Florida) had passed legislation about drug screening welfare recipients. There’s a slight difference between Florida’s stalled law and similar laws on the books in other states, however. Florida’s law would have required all welfare recipients to undergo drug tests. Other states use “suspicion based testing,” which hasn’t been found unconstitutional, according to the NCSL. In Tennessee, a state that uses suspicion based testing, 16,017 welfare applicants were drug tested in the first six months of the program. Thirty-seven of them tested positive for drugs, and another 81 applicants didn’t complete the application process. Other states are considering similar proposals, the Tennessean reports : “The proposals have emerged after a federal court ruled Florida’s drug testing law unconstitutional because it required drug testing of every applicant for public assistance, violating protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Most of the new proposals are written to withstand a similar legal challenge and require testing only of individuals suspected of drug abuse. Such ‘suspicion-based’ models rely on initial screenings, similar to the written test required of Tennessee applicants.” ","Government"
"Priests Weren’t Allowed to Say Mass During Government Shutdown-Fiction!","2015-04-25 11:35:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/priests-werent-allowed-to-say-mass-during-government-shutdown/"," The government didn’t allow priests to say mass on some military bases during the government shutdown. "," There was talk about Catholic mass being canceled at some military bases during the government shutdown, but it never actually happened. John Schlageter, the general counsel for the Archdiocese for the Military Services, released a statement in October 2013 warning that mass could be canceled at some military bases if the government shutdown continued. The problem, as told by John Schlageter, was not that the government wouldn’t allow priests to say mass. The problem was that a shortage of Catholic chaplains on active duty in the military meant the government had to hire priests as general contractors. Because of the government shutdown contract priests weren’t allowed by law to work, even on a voluntary basis, Schlageter said: “There is a chronic shortage of active duty Catholic chaplains. While roughly 25% of the military is Catholic, Catholic priests make up only about 8% of the chaplain corps. That means approximately 275,000 men and women in uniform, and their families, are served by only 234 active-duty priests.  The temporary solution to this shortage is to provide GS and contract priests.   These men are employed by the government to ensure that a priest is available when an active duty Catholic Chaplain is not present.  With the government shutdown, GS and contract priests who minister to Catholics on military bases worldwide are not permitted to work – not even to volunteer.  During the shutdown, it is illegal for them to minister on base and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so. “As an example, if a Catholic family has a Baptism scheduled at the base chapel this weekend, unless they can locate a priest who is not a GS or contract priest, they should consider it cancelled….  If you are a Catholic stationed in Japan or Korea and are served by a Contract or GS priest, unless you speak Korean or Japanese and can find a church nearby, then you have no choice but to go without Mass this weekend.  Until the Federal Government resumes normal operations, or an exemption is granted to contract or GS priests, Catholic services are indefinitely suspended at those worldwide installations served by contract and GS priests.” In the end, mass was not canceled at military bases because of the government shutdown. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reinstated civilian employees of the Defense Department, including contract priests, before that happened. President Obama had signed a stopgap budget to ensure that service members would receive pay during the government shutdown, and Hagel interpreted that the stopgap budget also applied to civilian defense employees.

A story that appeared on the fake news website World News Daily Report claimed that retired CIA operative Normand Hodges confessed to the assassination of Marilyn Monroe on his deathbed. Normand Hodges recalled Marilyn Monroe’s “assassination” in the article: “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy, but also with Fidel Castro. My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die, and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose.

However, according to World News Daily Report’s disclaimer , the website assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” If the website’s disclaimer wasn’t enough to prove this claim false, the story includes photos of an elderly man identified as Normand Hodges that can easily be proven false. The man in the photos is Michael Tyrell, a terminally ill prisoner who was serving a 20-year prison sentence for drug offenses, the Guardian reports . Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her bedroom on August 5, 1962. The coroner ruled that her death was a probable suicide by barbiturates, according to the autopsy report : “Miss Monroe has suffered from psychiatric disturbance for a long time. On more than one occasion … when disappointed or depressed, she has made a suicide attempt. On these occasions, she had been rescued. It is our opinion the same pattern was repeated except for the rescue.” Many conspiracy theories have persisted over the years about Marilyn Monroe’s death. Some speculate that the FBI assassinated her, and others speculate that Bobby Kennedy ordered her assassination. At this point, however, those are nothing more than conspiracy theories.

It’s illegal to receive federal benefits based on false information, and that’s exactly what this email describes. The email first talks about the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) housing choice voucher program . The program gives low-income families the ability to choose where they live and provides them vouchers to help pay rent. The email says that a landlord can legally collect housing choice voucher payments for a property that he lives in with a girlfriend so long as he has a different mailing address. That’s not true. Housing choice vouchers are issued by local housing authorities. The local authority signs a housing assistance payment contract with the landlord, and only people who are named on the lease are allowed to live there, according to the National Housing Law Project . It is illegal for anyone who isn’t named on a lease to live at one of these properties, including the landlord. The law requires local housing authorities to have policies in place to identify “unauthorized occupancy.” Those policies vary, but one common example is that a guest can’t stay for more than 14 days in a row, or for more than 20 days in a calendar year. People who receive housing choice vouchers and have unauthorized residents living in their units could face federal charges . They could also be terminated from the program . ","Government"

As part of those efforts, the FBI says it targets outlaw motorcycle gangs “whose members use their motorcycle clubs as conduits for criminal enterprises.” That means the FBI doesn’t have any interest in law abiding motorcycle owners.

"," It’s true that Ted Cruz was born in Canada, but that doesn’t mean he can’t run for president. After Cruz announced that he would run for president in 2016, questions came up about the location of his birth and the status of his citizenship. That wasn’t the first time people have questioned the Texas Republican’s birthplace, either. Those questions led Cruz to release his birth certificate in 2013. It says he was born in Calgary to Eleanor Wilson and Rafael Bienvenido Cruz. At the time of his birth, Cruz’s mother was an American citizen, and his father was a Cuban citizen, the Dallas Morning News reports : “The U.S. Constitution allows only a ‘natural born’ American citizen to serve as president. Most legal scholars who have studied the question agree that includes an American born overseas to an American parent, such as Cruz.” The law says that Cruz’s mother would have had to live in the U.S. for 10 years, and that she had to be older than 14 for at least five of those years, in order for her son to be born a natural U.S. citizen. Nobody has questioned that she did that. But, oddly enough, Cruz was considered a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada until he renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Questions about the citizenship of presidential candidates are not new. Senator John McCain faced questions when he ran for president in 2008 because he was born on a military base in Panama. The Senate ended up passing a resolution that stated McCain was a natural born citizen and was eligible to run for president. President Obama has also faced questions about his U.S. citizenship throughout his presidency. Click here to read learn more about that. ","Government"

The email also says that 35 governors have sued for a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would limit federal power. "," Both of these claims are false. There is a Student Loan Repayment Program in place to help attract and retain federal employees, but it does not extend to family members. Elected officials, uniform service members and other government employees are eligible under the law . Federal employees can have up to $10,000 in federally insured student loans repaid each year, and up to $60,000 repaid over their career, the Office of Personnel Management reports . And the federal government does not forgive these loans, as the eRumor claims. The loans are repaid. That’s important because it means federal employees have to pay taxes on loan payments just like the rest of their salaries. In 2013, $52.9 million in student loan repayments were made for 7,314 federal employees, the Office of Personnel and Management reports . The email’s claim that 35 governors had sued the U.S. government for a 28th amendment is also false. The email says that the proposed 28th amendment would state: “Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators, Representatives of Congress; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States…” That same language was used in an eRumor that TruthorFiction.com found to be false in 2013.

At last count, three states had tried to force a constitutional convention. Resolutions in Kansas, Georgia and Indiana sought to balance state and federal power, the Huffington Post reports . And under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, 34 states have to pass a resolution on the same subject to force a constitutional convention — not 38 states, as the eRumor claims. ","Government"
"FEMA Corps Team Members Are the Modern Day Hitler Youth-Fiction!","2015-03-23 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-corps-hitler-youth/"," This is a forwarded email that contains an article that compares a group of American youths who recently graduated from the FEMA Corps program to Hitler Youth.  The email also alleges that the Department of Homeland Security is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition. "," The origin of the eRumor comes from an October 7, 2012 article from the Whiteout Press but these are the ramblings of someone who appears to know very little about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and World War II history of Nazi Germany. According to their website, FEMA Corps is a program that creates a pool of trained team members ranging from ages 18 to 24 to assist in disaster recovery.   The mission of this program is to establish a unit of 1,600 service corps members dedicated to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The benefit of this program is to prepare participants “for careers in emergency management and other related fields, building depth in the emergency management community.”  The first 480 members began training in August 2012 and became ready for deployment in September 2012.  The next training program begins in Winter 2013. FEMA Corps members are compensated for their time. According to the FAQ on their website, “FEMA Corps members receive a living allowance of approximately $4,000 for the 10 months of service (about $200 every two weeks before taxes), housing, meals, limited medical benefits” and members can receive up to an additional $400 a month for childcare.   After the first 10 month term of service there is an option to extend for a second year. Comparison to Hitler Youth Hitler Youth were created in the 1920’s and targeted boys and girls from the ages of 10 to 18. It began as a voluntary program but in 1936, after Adolf Hitler came into power the program became compulsory.   According to the Historylearingsite , the “task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service. For girls, the organization prepared them for motherhood.”    Members of FEMA Corps do not fall into to this age range nor are they trained or prepared for the military. The photo in the forwarded email depicting a young team of FEMA Corps members fully armed and ready to respond is inaccurate. According to a May 13, 2009 article in the New York Times the group in the photo are Explorer Scouts in a simulated counter terrorism training exercise, which occurred in California’s Imperial County under the leadership of local law enforcement and Border Patrol. The article said, “The Explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence — an intense ratcheting up of one of the group’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.” DHS Armament? The writer of the eRumor also alleged that the DHS is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition.  The DHS oversees agencies that conduct  law enforcement, military missions, and immigration enforcement. In a February 14, 2013 article by Fox News , it was disclosed that DHS training centers have used as much as 15 million rounds annually for training exercises and practice on shooting ranges. The article also said that the DHS plans to purchase 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling it “the federal government’s second largest criminal investigative agency.” But ICE is not the only armed agency under the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Secret Service, the intelligence agency that was originally under the Department of the Treasury has the responsibility of protecting the President and dignitaries.  This agency has been under the blanket of the DHS since March 1, 2003.   One agency under the DHS that could be considered to be a major user of weapons and ammunition is the United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is on loan to the DHS from the Department of Transportation and has enough fire power to protect U.S. ports, chase and apprehend pirates and smugglers and assist in the protection of our military assets and facilities in the Persian Gulf. The USCG lists 212 aircraft, various vessels ranging in boats from 18 feet to 47 feet along with a fleet of cutters ranging from 65 feet to 179 feet.  The USCG also performs search and rescue for mariners in peril on the water. The USCG H-65 Dolphin helicopter in the photo above is usually armed with Single 7.62mm M240B/H machine gun, a 7.62mm shoulder-fired precision weapon and a .50-caliber shoulder-fired precision weapon. USCG Cutter Stratton pictured above is one of the newest ships in the fleet can carry USCG Helicopters and has an armament of 57mm Bofors Gun, 1 Phalanx, a CIWS 1B 20mm, four 50 caliber machine guns, as well as two M240B light machine guns.  The cutter is also capable of launching 25 Foot Defender Class Boats with gun mounts both forward and aft. Other agencies under the DHS, according to their organizational chart , are U.S. Customs & Boarder Protection, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, and Transportation Security Administration.   Each agency has members who carry and are trained to use weapons. Special Armored Vehicles The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV or “Humvee”) are real and some agencies receive training on these armored vehicles designated for Special Response Teams by the DHS.  The above photo shows members of  U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement in a special training exercise involving armored vehicles. Also, FEMA is the training agency for first responders from the local level to agencies under the DHS.   So that all agencies speak the same language at the scene of a disaster the Incident Command System was developed for all levels of government as well as private sector and by many nongovernmental organizations. updated 2/14/13 ","Government"

"," The federal government has launched a pilot program that will provide training to police departments in six cities, but it’s not true that the departments are being federalized. The six cities will take part in the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice pilot program. The program is part of the “ My Brother’s Keeper ” initiative that President Obama set up in 2014 in an effort to “create opportunities for all young people.” Attorney General Eric Holder said in March of 2015 that the first six cities to take part in the program would be Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Worth, Texas; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Stockton, California: “The Department of Justice is committed to using innovative strategies to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation in communities where trust has been eroded,” said Attorney General Holder.  “By helping to develop programs that serve their own diverse experiences and environments, these selected cities will serve on the leading edge of our effort to confront pressing issues in communities around the country.” According to the Department of Justice, $4.75 million will be used to develop a plan that enhances procedural justice, reduces racial bias and supports reconciliation in these six cities. A board of advisors from academic, law enforcement, faith-based and civil rights backgrounds will lead the program, the DOJ said . The stated goal of the program is to provide technical assistance, research and organizational support to help police departments improve community relations.

"President Obama Talks About Mandatory Voting in the US – Truth!","2015-03-20 18:46:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-talks-about-mandatory-voting-in-the-us/"," President Obama said that mandatory voting for U.S. citizens would help make money in politics less powerful. "," It’s true that President Obama talked about mandatory voting at a town hall meeting. But the White House later denied that he planned to make it a law. President Obama was asked about the impact of money in politics at a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 18, 2015. Obama replied that mandatory voting would be one way to make money less powerful: “We shouldn’t be making it harder to vote. We should be making it easier to vote. I’ve said that publicly before. So, my Justice Department is going to be vigorous in terms of trying to force voting rights. I gave a speech down in Selma on the 50th anniversary, and it was incredibly moving for me, and my daughters, and the notion that in this day and age we would be deliberately trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense. At the state and local levels you can push back against that and make sure we’re expanding the franchise, not restricting it. “In Australia, that’s one of the countries that have mandatory voting. It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything. If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country because the people who tend not to vote are young, they’re lower income, they’re skewed more heavily toward immigrant groups and minority groups. They’re often the folks who are scratching and climbing to get into the middle class and working hard. There’s a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls when we should be trying to get them into the polls. So, that may be a better strategy in the short-term.” A day after the president’s remarks, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the president had given an “open-ended answer” to the question. Earnest added that, “The president was not making a specific policy prescription for the United States.” About 40% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. In Australia, voters are required to go to the polls, but they aren’t forced to cast a ballot. About 95% of people turn out for elections there, and the other 5% “may incur a small fine if insufficient excuse is offered,” wrote Haydon Manning, a professor at the University of Rochester.

"Valerie Jarrett, White House Behind Hillary Clinton Email Scandal-Unproven!","2015-03-19 17:36:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/valerie-jarrett-and-white-house-behind-hillary-clinton-email-scandal/"," Rumors are spreading that White House Advisor Valerie Jarrett and other White House officials leaked the story about Hillary Clinton using a private email address as secretary of state to the press, and that more negative stories are on the way. "," People close to Bill and Hillary Clinton have said that Valerie Jarrett leaked negative stories about Hillary to the press — but Jarrett has denied it. There’s no hard evidence to prove whether rumors about mudslinging between the Clintons and the Obama Administration are true, but let’s take a look at how the eRumor started. Hillary Clinton’s email scandal blew up in early March of 2015. Reports that Clinton had used a private email account and a personal email server during her time as secretary of state raised questions about whether she had broken federal laws. Daniel Metcalfe, a former Department of Justice official, wrote in Politico: “In this case, which is truly unprecedented, no matter what Secretary Clinton would have one believe, she managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the (Freedom of Information Act), both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it — perhaps forever. ‘Nice work if you can get it,’ one might say, especially if your experience during your husband’s presidency gives you good reason (nay, even highly compelling motivation) to relegate unto yourself such control if at all possible.” Rumors that Valerie Jarrett and other White House officials had leaked the email scandal to the press started days after the story broke. The New York Post cited unnamed sources from Bill Clinton’s camp who made that claim, and the story spread like wildfire: “Members of Bill Clinton’s camp say the former president suspects the White House is the source of the leak and is furious. “’My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us,’ one of Bill’s friends quotes him as saying. ‘The Obamas are behind the email story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.’ “Then, according to this source, Bill added: ‘The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.’” The Post also reported that the White House would leak more negative stories about Hillary Clinton. Valerie Jarrett denied that on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” She said that the claim was “preposterous” during an interview : “It’s preposterous … as the president said last week, he really prides himself on having an administration that is transparent, and he’s glad to see that he’s turning over her emails to the State Department. So, yes, that’s very important.” This probably isn’t the last we’ll hear about this eRumor. Check back for future updates. ","Government"

The blog was viewed more than 500,000 times and was shared on Facebook nearly 100,000 times. Poll numbers indicated that Benjamin Netanyahu could be voted out of office at the time the blog was published, but he was eventually re-elected prime minister . We’ll take a look at each of the blog post’s five claims about Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu Is a War Hero- Truth! This one is true. Benjamin Netanyahu volunteered with an elite Special Forces unit of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called Sayeret Matkal. He took part in cross-border raids and missions like Operation Inferno and the rescue of hostages from a hijacked airplane in 1972, the Haaretz Newspaper reports . Netanyahu rose to the rank of captain before he was discharged after six years of service, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs . Netanyahu Was Wounded in Combat- Truth! Benjamin Netanyahu was wounded in combat twice, so this claim is true. Netanyahu was first wounded in 1969 during the War of Attrition. Netanyahu’s unit was deployed to the Suez Canal to fight Egyptian commandos, and he was hit in the shoulder by shrapnel from a rocket propel grenade, the Times of Israel reports . Netanyahu was also wounded in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War in Israel. Netanyahu’s Brother Was Killed in Combat- Truth! It’s true that Jonathan Netanyahu, Benjamin’s brother, was killed during the Entebbe raid that freed 100 hostages from a French jetliner in 1976. After his brother’s death, Benjamin Netanyahu founded the Jonathan Institute to fight terrorism by organizing conferences and influencing other world leaders. Netanyahu Studied at MIT and Harvard- Truth! It’s true that Benjamin Netanyahu studied at MIT and Harvard. He earned degrees in management studies and architecture from MIT. He also studied political science at MIT and Harvard, according to his official bio . Netanyahu Is One of the Most Successful Politicians in Israeli History- Reported as Truth! With his 2015 re-election , Netanyahu became Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. An argument can be made that he’s one of the country’s most successful politicians ever, but Netanyahu’s critics would argue otherwise. This one is a matter of personal opinion. ","Government"

"The Pentagon was not struck by a hijacked jet on September 11-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pentagoncrash/"," The allegation  is that the destruction at the Pentagon on September 11 was not the result of being hit by a hijacked American Airlines 757, but some other cause.  The theories range from the building being hit by a remote-control U.S. fighter jet to being damaged by a truck bomb. "," There are numerous sites that promote the notion that the U.S. government is covering up the true cause of the Pentagon destruction on September 11, but the main one is from France at http://www.asile.org/citoyens/numero13/pentagone/erreurs_en.htm In large headline, it asks the reader to “Hunt the Boeing,” referring to the American Airlines Boeing 757 that plunged into the Pentagon. The site is a part of speculation by conspiracy theorists and includes a book published in France by Thierry Meyssan titled “The Frightening Fraud.”  In it, the author contends that flight #77 did not end by crashing into the Pentagon and that the whole thing is part of a government plot and cover-up.  Meyssan says it doesn’t make sense to him that there aren’t any airplane pieces left over from the crash and that the Pentagon did not immediately fall from the impact. The website asks several questions, which we will deal with in order. 1.  “The Associated Press first reported that a booby trapped truck had caused the explosion.” If this AP report was made, TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find it and none of the sites that makes reference to it lists a source.  Conflicting reports are common during breaking stories and if someone did speculate a truck bomb, that theory quickly disappeared. 2.  “Can you explain how a Boeing 757- 200, weighing nearly 100 tons and travelling at a minimum speed of 250 miles an hour only damaged the outside of the Pentagon? ” First, the Pentagon suffered extensive damage to more than just the outside. CLICK HERE TO SEE CHART Also, the portion of the Pentagon where the plane hit was probably the most heavily reinforced.  In the October 3, 2001 edition of Architecture Week, B.J. Novitski wrote that the impact of the plane was in “Wedge One,” which had been strengthened by recent renovation, a project that was inspired, in part, by the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He says that contrary to what is believed, the casualties among workers in the Pentagon were not low because of vacant offices, but because of the extraordinary structural strength of the building.  Novitski says that about 80 percent of the workers in the wedge were on duty that day, but …”the exterior walls had been reinforced with steel beams and columns, bolted where they met at each floor. Some of these reinforced walls very near the point of impact remained in place for a half hour before collapsing, allowing uncounted hundreds to escape.”  The hijackers chose one of the most reinforced buildings in the world to crash into. 3.  ‘Can you explain how a Boeing 14.9 yards high, 51.7 yards long, with a wingspan of 41.6 yards and a cockpit 3.8 yards high, could crash into just the ground floor of this building?’ Eyewitnesses to the crash as well as video from a security camera at the Pentagon show that the plane struck at ground level.  Considering the description of the strength of the building (above), it is not surprising that the weaker appendages of the plane such as the tail and the wings would not have had as much of an impact as the main body. 4.  “Can you explain why the Defence [sic] Secretary deemed it necessary to sand over the lawn, which was otherwise undamaged after the attack?” According to the article in Architecture Week, it was for a gravel bed that provided a road for large trucks to have access to the crash site. 5.  “Can you explain what happened to the wings of the aircraft and why they caused no damage?” Same answer as in #3.  Photographs show indentations where the stronger, inner portions of the wings may have made impact, but the farther out towards the tips of the wings and the tail, the less they would have had effect. 6.  “Can you find the aircraft’s point of impact? We’re not sure what this question is supposed to mean.  There are plenty of pictures that show clearly where the airplane hit the building.  For some reason, the creators of the website chose two of the pictures that don’t show it clearly.  Dick Bridges, the deputy manager for Arlington County was quoted by AP on September 14, 2001, as saying that both of the “black boxes” for flight #77 were found “…right where the plane came into the building.”  If the recorders didn’t get much beyond that, the plane not only struck the building at that point, but the ground as well.  The cockpit voice recorder was so badly damaged that it didn’t yield any information. Other considerations… 1.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77 that hit the Pentagon, then where is the airplane and the 64 people who were aboard? None of the conspiracy sites answers that question.  Few of them even ask it. 2.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77, then why do they have evidence of the bodies of known crew, passengers, and hijackers? C. Christopher Kelley of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology says that the effort to identify bodies that ended on November 16, 2001, identified all but one of the victims of flight 77. 3.  In response to the question of “Where is the Boeing,” the answer is “in pieces.” There was plenty of evidence of the airplane at the site including debris from the plane, as mentioned above, the remains of the passengers, and the cockpit data and voice recorders.  Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reported on September 13,2001,  that members of congress who had visited the Pentagon crash site were told by rescue officials that much of the fuselage of the Boeing 757 remained intact inside the damaged Pentagon. 4.  Radar tracked the plane toward the Pentagon. Much has been made on some of the conspiracy sites that the transponder in the cockpit was turned off by the hijackers so it isn’t clear what happened to the plane after that.  The founder of TruthOrFiction.com, Rich Buhler, is a licensed commercial pilot and says the transponder being turned off doesn’t mean the plane can no longer be seen on radar.  The transponder is a device that not only makes the airplane more visible on a radar screen, but also gives the radar controller other information such as the altitude, speed, and sometimes the identity of the airliner.  If the transponder is turned off, radar controllers can usually still see what is called the “primary target.”  That means there is a blip on the radar screen showing the location.  According to www.airdisaster.com , flight 77’s transponder was turned off shortly after departure from Dulles airport near Washington DC, but radar controllers could see the primary target flying directly toward the White House.  Then the plane was seen to veer away from the White House and head for the Pentagon.","Government"

A later version says that the reason CBS cancelled Touched By an       Angel was because of references to God on the show. "," This is a false eRumor and an interesting twist is that Madalyn Murray O’Hair has been out of the picture since she disappeared in August, 1995.  In January, 2001, authorities in Texas found her remains in a shallow grave and the question then became what would happen to the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors?  We got our answer less than a month later when we started receiving versions of the rumors that began with, “THOUGH SHE’S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE. – GET THIS:”  So, it looks like the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors will survive for a while. In the Fall of 2002, a new version appeared as an appeal from radio psychologist Dr. James Dobson for your help in fighting O’Hair and that in addition to the Touched By An Angel threat, she was also trying to take all Christian broadcasting off the air including Catholic Mass.  That was a combined version of the two major eRumors about O’Hair and is a hoax.  Dr.Dobson has made no such appeal. The end of Touched By An Angel was not a mystery and had nothing to do with the show’s religious content.  It was a very successful program that ran for 9 seasons and simply ran its course. The Touched By An Angel is a variation of another Madalyn Murray O’Hair rumor that is more than 20 years old. CLICK HERE for that story.  The petition number, “RM-2493”, is from a false rumor that Madalyn Murray O’Hair was appealing to the Federal Communications Commission to take all religious broadcasting off the air.

"IRS refund checks are not what we think-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:58:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxadvance/"," An article from the Rocky       Mountain News in Colorado has gotten wide circulation on the       Internet.  The writer, David Milstead, warns that the tax       “refund” everybody thought they were receiving as a part       of a tax reform measure from Congress and President Bush is not a       refund.  It’s actually money from taxes that will be paid for       tax year 2001. "," According to the Internal Revenue Service, this is true. Here is a step-by-step explanation. 1.  Congress passed, and President Bush signed, “The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.” 2.  Among other things, it lowered taxes on your income after December 31,2000.  That means it applies to money you earned beginning in 2001 and does not apply to money you earned in 2000. 3.  Ordinarily, you would wait until 2001 is over to compute your taxes and pay them by April 15, 2002.  That would mean that if Congress gave you a tax break for your 2001 income, you would expect to benefit from it at that time. 4.  The law passed by Congress, however, gives us an “advance payment” on our 2001 taxes even before the year is over and long before the time that we would normally be computing and paying those taxes. 5.  The problem, however, is that since you are receiving the advance payment for a tax year that is not yet completed, how  does the IRS know how much your payment should be?  The answer is that the IRS is using your year 2000 tax figures to give them a clue.  They are asking, “If the lower tax rate had been in effect at that time, how much less tax would you have had to pay?”  That’s one of the reasons why not every person is receiving a check.  If you didn’t pay any taxes for 2000, you don’t get an advance check.  You may ask, “But that doesn’t seem fair because even though I didn’t pay any taxes for 2000, I know I will be for 2001, so I should get a break too.”  You are right and when you compute your taxes for 2001, that can be adjusted. 7.  When tax time does come around in April, 2002, you may look at the tax tables and notice that the tax rates don’t seem to be lower.  That’s because the advance payment check represented your tax relief for 2001.  You already got it.  If Congress gave the advance payment and lowered the tax tables too, that would be a double tax cut. updated 7/17/12 ","Government"

"WWII Memorial revises history in Roosevelt quotation-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/wwiimemorial/"," A inscription on the new WW II memorial in Washington DC cites President Franklin Roosevelt’s famous “Day of infamy” quote about the attack of the Japanese on Pearl Harbor in 1941, but leaves out the phrase “So help us God.” "," The eRumor is simply wrong. There is a list of all the inscriptions on the World War II Memorial on the official website at www.wwiimemorial.com .  One of them is from Roosevelt’s “Day of Infamy” speech, but is not the portion quoted in the eRumor. According to the website, this is the inscription: “DECEMBER 7, 1941, A DATE WHICH WILL LIVE IN INFAMY…NO MATTER HOW LONG IT MAY TAKE US TO OVERCOME THIS PREMEDITATED INVASION, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS MIGHT, WILL WIN THROUGH TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.” The inscription uses the first phrase from Roosevelt’s speech then jumps down several paragraphs and draws a sentence from a portion of the speech that does not have any connection to the expression “So help us God.”  That phrase is near the end of the speech in a paragraph that says, “ With confidence in our armed forces – with the unbounding determination of our people – we will gain the inevitable triumph – so help us God.” Yesterday,       December 7, 1941 – a date which will live in infamy – the       United States of America was suddenly and deliberately       attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at       peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was       still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor       looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.       Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced       bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States       and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal       reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated       that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic       negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed       attack. It will be recorded that the       distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack       was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During       the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately       sought to deceive the United States by false statements and       expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the       Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval       and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.       In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the       high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu. Yesterday the Japanese       Government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night       Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong. Last night Japanese forces       attacked Guam. Last night Japanese forces attacked the       Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked Wake       Island. This morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island. Japan has, therefore,       undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the       Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The       people of the United States have already formed their opinions       and well understand the implications to the very life and       safety of our nation. As Commander-in-Chief of the       Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for       our defense. But always will we remember the       character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it       may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the       American people in their righteous might will win through to       absolute victory. I believe       that I interpret the       will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we       will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make       it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again       endanger us. Hostilities exist. There is       no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our       interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed       forces – with the unbounding determination of our people – we       will gain the inevitable triumph – so help us God. I ask that the Congress       declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by       Japan on Sunday, December seventh, 1941 a state of war has existed       between the United States and the Japanese Empire.

In the days following the announcement several news agencies have reported that President Obama issued an executive order that bypassed Congress to allow more than 800,000 young people to remain legally in the U.S. without fear of being deported but there has yet to be official executive order on the White House web site. Click for White House Executive Order page. The Dream Act: The Dream Act is a bill that was fist introduced in the Senate back in 2001.  This bill would grant conditional permanent resident status for certain long-term residents who entered the united states as children, if they met certain criteria. The word DREAM is an acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. The Hill, a newspaper that reports on the daily business in Congress while it is in session, has been following the progress of this act and in a May 11, 2011 article said the Dream Act would include immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children. According to the text of the Dream Act, some of the conditions that must be met by immigrants are that they must currently be residing in the United States and have a “good moral character during the entire period of conditional permanent resident status.”  Eligibility can also be granted to those who have “acquired a degree from an institution of higher education in the United States or has completed at least 2 years, in good standing, in a program for a bachelor’s degree or higher degree in the United States.”  There is also a condition for those who have served or are currently serving in the U. S. Military for at least 2 years.  If they are no longer serving and have been discharged they must show proof of an honorable discharge. Over the years, the bill has failed to pass in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which are the two necessary steps for a bill before it can be signed into law by the President.  The Dream act has been brought up a number of times since 2001.  The last time, in 2010 before the 111th Congress under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi.  Congress passed the bill on December 8, 2010 but it was met by tough opposition from the Senate according to an article posted that day in The Hill .

"," This eRumor is an unproven conspiracy theory. The first member on the list is Arif Alikhan, who has been serving in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since 2006.  His first appointment was Deputy Mayor for Homeland Security and Public Safety for the city of Los Angeles. Alikhan is a first generation American and his parents immigrated from Pakistan. One of his primary tasks over the years has been to educate our government and military on the culture and mindset of the terrorists that that the U.S. has been fighting since it began the War on Terror.   In 2009, DHS head Janet Napolitano appointed Alikhan  Assistant Secretary for Policy Development. Imam Mohamed Magid naturalized citizen who immigrated to the United States from the Sudan in 1987.  In 2011 President Barack Obama appointed Magid to serve in a Countering Violent Extremism Working Group with the DHS.  On January 22, 2013 Magid took part in the inaugural ceremonies of President Obama but the White House has no Sharia Czar, a title given to Iman Magid by critics of the Obama Administration. Mohamed Elibiary is an advisor to the Department of Homeland Security.  Out of this list he probably is the most controversial.   According to a November 9, 2011 CBN News article, Elibiary spoke at a Texas conference in 2004 and honored Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini as a “great Islamic visionary.”  Elibiary is a  member of the Department of Homeland Security’s Advisory Council.  He was granted access to a nationwide database that contained terror watch lists and sensitive FBI reports, which he was accused of leaking portions of the  documents to the media in order to spread charges of “Islamophobia” within Governor Rick Perry’s Texas government.

Salam al-Marayati was born in Bagdad, Iraq and at the age of 4 his family immigrated to the U.S.  He became a naturalized citizen and earned a bachelors of science degree in Bio-Chemistry from the University of California Los Angeles.  According to his bio Al-Marayati is one of the founders of the Muslim Public Affairs Council and is currently the director of the organization. Al-Marayati has been a member of the Executive Committee of the California Democratic Party.

Dearborn City Hall may not be that accessible to non English speakers.  We checked the website of the city hall of Dearborn, Michigan and all text appears in English.   All contact information on the website is English only as well. Michigan has a large number of residents from all over the world and immigrants from the Middle East make up a high percentage of their population. It is not uncommon for state and local governments all over the U.S. to offer help in languages other than English based on the demographics of their residents.  This is simply a practice that reaches out to a diverse population which helps to get their information out to citizens. In comparison to the rest of the nation, Michigan takes third place in Arabic immigration, according to a December 4, 2003 article by the Michigan Daily . The article said, “Almost half of the Arabs in the United States live in five states – California (190,890), New York (120,370), Michigan (115,284), New Jersey (71,770) and Florida (77,461).”   At the time of our investigation those numbers are ten years old but we found that the Census Bureau has more current information posted on data collected between 2007 and 2011 for the state of  Michigan.

"Medicare Premiums Predicted to Increase While Congress is Getting Pay Raises-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/medicare-premiums/"," This one blames the 112th Congress, under the leadership of John Boehner, for increases in Medicare premiums while at the same time Congress offering no cost of living increase to Social Security recipients voting themselves a cost of living pay raise.   The email says that premiums in 2012 will go up from $96.40 to $104.20. In 2013 it says premiums will rise to $120.20 and in 2014 they will be hiked up to $247.00. "," This eRumor gets a little complex.  There were increases in Medicare premiums announced in 2010.  Currently, in 2012, the rates posted on the Medicare site are $451 for Part A and $99.90 for Part B. There were no Cost of Living increases for Social Security recipients in 2010 or 2011.  Congressional representatives have not received pay raises since 2009 and in 2010 actually voted to stop their annual automatic cost of living increases. During the Spring of 2012 one official looking version of this eRumor said that premiums would be hiked up to $247 in 2014.  The warning appeared to have come from a representative of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama.   According to an April 5, 2012 article in the Boston Globe, the insurance representative received this viral email and forwarded it from her work computer which pasted her company information at the bottom of the email, thus lending some credibility to the Internet Hoax. Click for story. Medicare Premium Increases On October 19, 2009, the New York Times reported that there would be an increase to Medicare Part B premiums from $100 to $115, a 15% increase.  The Times article said, “About 12 million people, or 27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, will have to pay higher premiums or have the additional amounts paid on their behalf.” On November 5, 2010, the Social Security Administration published a report of increases of Medicare premiums that said that depending on what plan participants are enrolled, the increases would vary.  These policies were enacted while  the 111th Congress, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, was in session. The Republican majority led 112th House did not take office until January 3, 2011, months after the changes to Medicare were enacted. For the most part, increases in premiums affect Medicare participants of Part B.  The report said, “Most beneficiaries will continue to pay the same $96.40 or $110.50 premium amount in 2011. Beneficiaries who currently have the Social Security Administration (SSA) withhold their Part B premium and have incomes of $85,000 or less (or $170,000 or less for joint filers) will not have an increase in their Part B premium in 2011.” It went on to say, “For all others, the standard Medicare Part B monthly premium will be $115.40 in 2011, which is a 4.4% increase over the 2010 premium. The Medicare Part B premium is increasing in 2011 due to possible increases in Part B costs. If your income is above $85,000 (single) or $170,000 (married couple), then your Medicare Part B premium may be higher than $115.40 per month.” TruthOrFiction.com has not found any evidence that the Social Security Administration has announced any future increases to Medicare premiums.   Any cost predictions not posted on the Medicare or SSA sites should be considered speculation.

Click for our findings. Congressional Pay Raises Neither the 111th nor 112th Congress voted for a cost of living increase in their salaries.  According to a May 14, 2010 article in The Hill , President Obama signed into law a bill that would stop all automatic pay raises to members of Congress.  The article said, “The base pay for House and Senate lawmakers is $174,000, though leaders earn a higher salary. The cost-of-living increase would have given lawmakers a $1,600 raise in 2011. By rescinding the increase, lawmakers saved taxpayers $850,000 for next year.” The Hill article also said, the House (111th) voted against a $2610 pay raise for each member, which amounted towards a savings of $1.4 million to the taxpayers.  The article added, “In 2008, members did not opt to rescind their pay and received a $4,100 increase, or 2.5 percent,” which cost taxpayers just over $2.2 million. updated 07/10/12 ","Government"

In our investigation, we located the term “Federal Benefit Payment” on a resource page of the website Answers.USA.gov .  At the bottom of this page was a notice that said, “USA.gov is the U.S. government’s official web portal.” Screenshot from Answers.USA.gov Background The term “Federal Benefit Payment” was originally coined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and elected leaders in the 1930’s, when the government program was first introduced. We know the following about Social Security payment, according to a publication found on the website of the the SSA: Social Security is part of the retirement plan of almost every American worker. In order to qualify for retirement benefits, a number of credits are needed, depending on the age of the worker.  For example, if a worker was born in 1929 or later, a total of 40 credits is needed, which is approximately equivalent to 10 years of employment with regular payments to the SSA deducted from their pay checks The SSA benefit payment is based on how much is earned during the course of the individual’s  working career.  The higher the lifetime earnings, the higher the benefit payment would be. Benefits can be collected when a minimum age is achieved, depending on when the individual was born. We found the chart below on the SSA publication  “Understanding the Benefits” : From SSA publication: “Understanding the Benefits” Most Social Security payments are now sent to recipients by means of direct deposit but a spokesperson from the SSA told TruthOrFiction.Com that if a check needs to be cut then it is mailed from the Department of the Treasury.

"Muslim Stamp by U.S. Postal Service Commemorates Muslim Holidays-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/eid/"," Various emails that say a Muslim stamp has been released by the U.S. Postal Service to commemorate a Muslim holiday.   Some version list a number of terrorist events believed to have been carried out by Moslems and call out for a boycott of these postage stamps. "," There are U.S. Postal Service (USPS)  stamps commemorating the EID season during the Muslim period of fasting and prayer known as Ramadan.  There are also customized stamps from other vendors that contain a USPS barcode for mail. This eRumor has a habit of going viral every time the U.S. Postal Service raise the price of a first class stamp or during the Ramadan season. In late January 2010 rumors began to circulate that the U.S. Postal Service released a new version of a postage stamp commemorating the EID Muslim Holiday.  In 2011 the USPS issued a new version of the stamp, which sparked another fury of emails to circulate the Internet. Each of the terrorist events has either been connected to or believed to be connected to Muslim terrorists, but the most common question we get is whether the postage stamp story is true. 2011 USPS EID Postage Stamp According to the United States Post Office website the stamp has had several issues in various denominations spanning from 34 cents in 2001 to 41 cents in 2007. The latest release was announced August 12, 2011 with a “Forever” denomination, which means that its value will remain constant with any increases in first class postage. Non Government Issue The postage stamp illustrated below was not issued by the USPS but by the Zazzle.com web site that sells custom made products, including postage stamps.  The web site has a variety of EID stamps and also permits customers to upload personal photographs for custom apparel, mugs, postage stamps and gifts. Non-USPS Stamp custom made by Zazzle.com Earlier Official US Postal Service Releases: 2009 USPS EID Postage Stamp According to the U.S. Postal Service, a 34-cent stamp was issued in September of 2001 and October of 2002 commemorating two important Islamic celebrations or eids.   They are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.  On those days, Muslims greet one another with “Eid mubarak,” which translates literally as “blessed festival.” The phrase is written in Islamic calligraphy on the stamp. 42 cent version of the stamp Muslim Christmas Stamps: A later version of the eRumor circulated saying it was a “Muslim Christmas Stamp.”     That is a fabrication someone added along the way.     Although Muslims regard Jesus as a prophet, they reject Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God and God incarnate and do not celebrate Christmas.    The Islamic celebrations the postage stamp commemorates are roughly in November and January and are celebrations that many Muslims focus on during the Christian holidays. updated 01/25/13 ","Government"
"FEMA Coffins and Internment Camps-Fiction! & Unproven Conspiracy Theory!","2015-03-17 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-coffins/"," This is a forwarded email that alleges that President Obama has ordered one billion dollars worth of disposable FEMA coffins.  The email also alleges that FEMA is building internment camps and buying up MRE’s, what the U.S. Military calls “Meals Ready to Eat.” "," This is an old unproven conspiracy theory that dates back to the 1990’s.    Someone has inserted President Obama into this eRumor to freshen it up. Lets address this one at at time: Are these Coffins? The items in the photos that usually accompanies this forwarded email are not coffins but burial vaults or grave liners made by the Vantage Products Corporation.   These burial vaults are designed to house coffins and protect buried coffins from the elements for hundreds of years. Screen shot from Vantage Products website. Does FEMA own the items in the photo of the forwarded email? The coffins in the photo do not belong to FEMA.  According to an August 11, 2008 article by the Morgan County Citizen in Atlanta, Georgia, Vantage Products began leasing this land in 1997 or 1998 to store their products.   Since grave liners are weatherproof this location proved to be an affordable storage site for anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 grave liners. Did U.S. patent # 5,425,163, describe the items as “cremation containers for multiple bodies?” The above patent for a “multi-functional cremation container” was granted on June 20, 1995, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has regularly been cited as the alleged proof that FEMA is pushing forward with plans for camps to carryout mass cremations.    Patent, No. 5,425,163 expired and nobody holds it. It lapsed on June 20, 1999, because its original owners, Raymond Von Braun and Robert Millby, failed to pay patent maintenance fees. This eRumor once again rose from the ashes after a January 23, 2014 article by the website TellMeNow.Com said that President Obama had allegedly purchased $1 billion in disposable FEMA coffins that are being stored at FEMA camps around the country. Ghoulish photos even depicted people sitting in black, plastic containers that are big enough to hold “three or four bodies,” the article said, at one such camp in Madison, Georgia. Do FEMA Camps exist??? The FEMA Camps part of the eRumor and conspiracy theory still remains to be proven.  There have been several natural disasters in the U.S. since the inception of this conspiracy theory.  One would think that if these camps existed, the thousands of evacuees of the August 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster would have been taken to a camp instead of the Houston Astrodome. AP News photo of Katrina victims in Astrodome FEMA Background and Mission: FEMA is the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Their main mission, according to their website is “to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards.” FEMA falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and is the main training resource for the Incident Command System (ICS), the special training given to all first responders in the United States.  Their online courses are available free to anyone and certificates of passing the courses are emailed to the students.

Some versions of this eRumor say that millionaire Warren Buffett is asking readers to forward this email. "," This eRumor originally appeared as the “Congressional Reform Act of 2011,”  which was never a real bill in Congress, but it is a passionate plea for change on behalf of concerned citizens hoping to get the word out across the World Wide Web. It first appeared in January 2011. Later, in October 2011, versions with an inserted quote by business millionaire Warren Buffett began circulating and also said that he was requesting all readers to forward the email. The Buffett quote is real and taken from a transcript of an interview on CNBC on July 7, 2011 .  Buffett gave a humorous quick solution to fix the problems of the deficit and Congress during a live interview.  Buffett jokingly said, “I could end the deficit in five minutes. You just pass a law that says that any time there’s a deficit of more than three percent of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election. Yeah, yeah, now you’ve got the incentives in the right place, right?” TruthOrFiction.Com has found no evidence that Warren Buffett has made such a plea to forward this email on the Internet. Just about every year after that a new version off this eRumor has risen from the ashes and in 2014 a version, still alleged to have been thought of by Warren Buffet, was modified to include the salaries of retired presidents and members of the Legislative Branch. This version goes on to compare those salaries to enlisted military and teachers. We do not know who wrote this email other than a concerned citizen who wanted to change Congress. This call for citizen action first appeared on the Internet shortly after the 112th Congress was sworn in on January 5, 2011. Days later it began moving through the World Wide Web like wild fire. The writer of the email is apparently passionate about his recommendation but failed to give any directions as to where all these forwarded emails could be sent to do any good. We found some of the claims from the list to be inaccurate: Congressional representatives are exempt from paying into Social Security – Fiction! Elected representatives are not exempt from paying into Social Security. We have findings posted in a related eRumor. Click for findings. Congressional representatives are above the law- Fiction! Congressional representatives are not above the law. Here are some recent examples of those who have been caught, tried and convicted: In early January 2010 former GOP Congressman Tom Delay was sentenced to 3 years in prison after being found guilty for his participation in a scheme to illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. Three years later, a Texas court overturned Delay’s conviction, “saying prosecutors failed to prove that he broke the law in a fundraising scandal from the 2002 elections.”  This according to a September 19, 2013 article by USA Today.  The article also said that the  District Attorney for Travis County plans appeal the decision. James A. Traficant, an Ohio Democrat, was expelled from Congress after being found guilty of bribery and racketeering. Traficant served seven years behind bars in a Minnesota prison and was released in 2009. Congressional representatives are exempt from Health Care policies- Fiction! Congressional representatives are not exempt from the healthcare reform law. Congressional representatives have been voting themselves cost of living pay raises- Fiction! Cost of living salary increases for congressional members have been automatically generated in the past, but some members have been known to voluntarily opt out of it. Members of Congress have not gotten a raise in pay in the last 2 years while the US has been facing hard economic times. Also, the 111th Congress, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, voted to stop the automatic pay raise for the last two consecutive years. President Obama signed the last bill into law on May 14, 2010, which will affect congressional pay raises in 2011, according to a May 14th article by the congressional newspaper, The Hill. The article also said, “The base pay for House and Senate lawmakers is $174,000, though leaders earn a higher salary. The cost-of-living increase would have given lawmakers a $1,600 raise in 2011.

He was not heard from again until the Taliban posted a video of him in captivity.

Insurance Premium Sticker Shock To make matters worse, the ACA is driving premium costs higher.  On November 6, 2013, NBC News reported that the new conditions set into policies “To a larger degree than other requirements of the law, it is fueling the ‘sticker shock’ now being voiced by some consumers about premiums for new policies, say industry experts.”  This means people will either have to pay more to get similar coverage to what they are used to or shop for a plan with a higher deductible and less benefits. On November 7, 2013 President Obama, in an interview on NBC News, said that he was sorry “to Americans who are losing their health plans.”   This according to a Washington Post article dated the same day.

"Religious significance of George Washington and the Washington memorial-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/washmonument/"," The eRumor describes some of the inscriptions and design of the Washington Monument in Washington D.C. in light of controversy over references to God in government settings. "," This one’s got many statements in it, so let’s take them one by one. The words “Laus Deo” on the cap of the monument- Truth! There is an aluminum point crowning the apex of the monument. There are four sides, each facing a point of the compass.  According to the National Park Service, the north side lists the members of the joint commission that was in charge of the Washington monument project.  The west side lists the dates of the laying of the cornerstone, the first stone laid at the height of 152 fee, and the the setting of the capstone. The south side lists the names of chief engineer, the architect, and some of the workmen.  The east side simply has the words “Laus Deo” which is translated as “Praise be to God.” Washington DC was laid out to be in the design of a cross- Fiction! It seems to be in the form of a cross, but there’s no evidence that was the intent of the designer, architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant.  If one sees the layout of White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Capitol, and The Lincoln Memorial as the intended cross, it was not in the mind of Charles L’Enfant because he proposed the original design in 1791, which was long before it was decided that the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials would be built and where (1911 and 1934). On the 12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore- Truth! There is a memorial stone in the wall at the 140-foot level with the following blessing: “May heaven to this union continue its beneficence.  May brotherly affection with union be perpetual. May the free constitution which is the work of our ancestors be sacredly maintained and its administration be stamped with wisdom and virtue.” On the 20th landing is a memorial presented by some Chinese Christians- Truth! It is from Christians from the port city of Ningpo, Chekiang Province, Mainland China and is a eulogy to George Washington. On the 24th landing a presentation made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6.- Truth! The memorial says it is presented by the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York and from the Sabbath School children of the Methodist Episcopal church in Philadelphia.  It then says “A preached Gospel” and “A free press” then closes with “Washington, we revere his memory.” The inscriptions include the Bible reference Proverbs 10:7. There is also an open bible on the monument that includes Luke 18:16 where Jesus said “Suffer the little children to come unto me” and Proverbs 22:6, which says “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” When the cornerstone was laid, one of the items in it was a Bible-Truth! Several dozen items were placed into the monument at the laying of the cornerstone including, according to the National Park Service, a copy of the Bible presented by The Bible Society. Washington’s Prayer for America- Truth! But altered. This is an interesting one. This “prayer of Washington” is widely circulated and reflects his true wishes about the United States because the bulk of it comes from his own words. There is a certain lack of integrity with the prayer, however, in that he never really formally prayed it in the way that is circulated. Someone along the way decided to create the prayer from one of Washington’s letters and package it in the fabricator’s own religious cultural language. The original words from Washington are from the closing paragraph of a letter to the governors of the 13 states on the occasion of his retirement from command of the Continental Army and public life.  We consulted John C. Fitzpatrick’s collection of the writings of George Washington that are available through the University of Virginia Library and which includes the text of the letter. In the letter, Washington said that he wanted the governors to convey his words to their legislatures and that he hoped it would be regarded as coming from someone who always wished to be useful to his country and who in the shade of retirement would not fail to “implore divine benediction upon it.” Then his final paragraph contains the words of his benediction: I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preside, in his holy protection, that he would incline the hearts of the Citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to Government, to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow Citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have served in the Field, and finally, that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all, to do Justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that Charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the Characteristicks of the Divine Author of our blessed Religion, and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy Nation. The prayer that is circulated, however, adds a formal salutation and prayer ending, changes it to King James English (used for formal prayers among many Christian groups), changes some of the wording, and leaves out words from the original.   A blessing that was written to the governors of the states about their states and their soldiers was changed to be a general prayer about the country. We even found one reference that claimed the prayer was prayed by George Washington during battle at Valley Forge. Last updated 12/5/03 ","Government"

Supporters say totalization benefits large numbers of Americans too, not just foreigners in the U.S..  One of the problems, according to the Social Security Administration, is that Americans, for example, who have worked in both the U.S. and a foreign country may end up being double taxed for retirement benefits.  Additionally, there are some workers who have worked, for example, for a period of time in the United States then worked for a period of time in a foreign country, but failed to qualify for benefits in either country.  The totalization agreements allow both U.S. and foreign workers to qualify for benefits based on the combined coverage of both countries..  According to the Washington Post, there is an estimated 37,000 Mexicans who worked legally in the United States and paid into Social Security but have not been able to collect their checks.  One of the controversies of totalization is that it may include thousands of foreign workers who were in the U.S. illegally but did pay into Social Security.  Immigration reform in 1996 cut their benefits.

"," For some people, it’s sport to point out government waste and bureaucratic stupidity, but this story about the space pen won’t provide ammunition for it.  The government did not fund the development of the pen, it did not cost $12 million to perfect, and neither the Americans nor the Russians consider it desirable to use pencils in space.  In fact, both Americans and Russians use the space pen for their flights. The famous space pen, which is still a popular product today, was developed by Paul Fisher the founder of the Fisher pen company.  An engineer who improved ball point technology, he created his “bullet pen” in the 1940’s, which became one of the best-selling pens of the Twentieth Century. Later, he perfected a pen that was sealed with pressure inside of the cartridge that made the ink to flow regardless of gravity.  It also worked in high and low temperature extremes, underwater, and wrote on many kinds of surfaces.  According to the Fisher Pen company, after extensive testing, NASA chose the pen in 1967 for use by Apollo astronauts and it’s been a part of space travel ever since.  The company says it took Fisher about 2 years and $2 million to develop the space pen.  Prior to 1967, there were no pens that worked in space so there were pencils used, but there were concerns about pencil dust floating around the space capsules as well as fears that if the tip of a pencil broke off and drifted into the electronics, there would be problems.

"Democratic Origins of Social Security-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ss-origins/"," The eRumor lists several things about Social Security as it was supposed to have been instituted under the Democratic presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt: Such as: 1.  That contributions to Social Security were voluntary. 2.  That it would cost only one percent of the first $1,400 of annual income. 3.  That the contributions into Social Security would be tax deductible. 4.  That the money would go into a trust fund dedicated to Social Security and not be used to pay other federal bills. 5.  That annuity payments to retirees would not be taxed. "," Let’s take them one at a time. That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary- Fiction! According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Social Security (FICA) contribution is a payroll tax and, like all taxes, has never been voluntary. That the participants would only have to pay 1 % of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program- Fiction! SSA says the original tax rate was 1% on the employer and the employee on the first $3,000 of annual wages. That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year- Fiction! The 1935 law prevented Social Security contributions from being tax deductible and they never have been. That the money the participants put into the independent “Trust Fund” rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program…- Truth! This one gets a little complex. According to the SSA, the way that Social Security is financed has not changed since it was enacted in 1939. Social Security payroll taxes are deposited into The Social Security Trust Fund.  The SSA says that those funds have never been taken out and put into a “general fund.” There was an accounting change in 1968, however, that listed the Trust Fund under something called the “unified budget” along with all other federal programs. In 1990, there was another accounting change that took the Trust Fund out from under that umbrella, but according to the SSA, it was merely a matter of accounting practices, not the function of the fund itself. That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income- Fiction! There was no guarantee that Social Security payments would never be taxed. Originally, they were not taxed, but in 1983, Congress passed a law that did include Social Security payments as taxable income. posted 7/06/07 ","Government"

"," First, there is no evidence this was written by Andy Rooney. His seems to be one of the new and popular names that people want to add to a forwarded email in order to try and give it more credibility. Let’s take each statement one at a time: As you walk up the steps to the building which houses the U.S. Supreme Court you can see near the top of the building a row of the world’s law givers and each one is facing one in the middle who is facing forward with a full frontal view – it is Moses and he is holding the Ten Commandments!- Truth! But Inaccurate! Above the east entrance to the Supreme Court building (which is the back entrance, not the front entrance), Moses is one of three Eastern law givers along with Confucius and Solon. Although he’s in the middle, Confucius and Salon are facing the front as well, not facing Moses. There are figures on each side of the three men facing them. The tablets in the sculpture are blank and although inspired by the Ten Commandments, the office of the curator of the U.S. Supreme Court says they have come to symbolically represent the “tablets of the law.” The artist, Herman MacNeil, said “The ‘Eastern Pediment’ of the Supreme Court Building suggests…the treatment of such fundamental laws and precepts as are derived from the East. Moses, Confucius and Solon.” As you enter the Supreme Court courtroom, the two huge oak doors have the Ten Commandments engraved on each lower portion of each door- Unproven! As stated above, the tablets are used in the Supreme Court building as symbolic representations of law. In some places they also represent not the Ten Commandments but the first ten amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. As you sit inside the courtroom, you can see the wall, right above where the Supreme Court judges sit, a display of the Ten Commandments!- Fiction! The wall that is described includes a frieze that, among other things, has two male figures who represent the Majesty of Law and the Power of Government. Between the two male figures is a tablet with the numbers 1 through 10 in Roman numerals. According to the artist, Adolph A. Weinman, these represent the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. There are Bible verses etched in stone all over the Federal Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C. – Truth! It is true that there are versus from the Bible on various buildings and monuments in Washington D.C. James Madison, the fourth president, known as “The Father of Our Constitution” made the following statement “We have staked the whole of all our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”- Unproven! We’ve not been able to find documentation for this. Patrick Henry, that patriot and Founding Father of our country said, “It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians, not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ” – Unproven!

According to U.S. Senate documents, the chaplaincy for the U.S. Senate was established in 1789 . Fifty-two of the 55 founders of the Constitution were members of the established orthodox churches in the colonies- Truth! It was common for leaders of that time to be a member of a church. According to research conducted by U.S.Constitution.net, here is the breakdown of the religion of the framers of the U.S. Constitution: Congregationalist-7 Deist-1 Dutch Reformed-2 Episcopalian-26 Lutheran-1 Methodist-2 Presbyterian-11 Quaker-3 Roman Catholic-2 Some either changed church affiliation in their lifetimes or had dual membership. Thomas Jefferson worried that the Courts would overstep their authority and instead of interpreting the law would begin making law….an oligarchy….the rule of few over many- Truth! One of Jefferson’s biographers, Dumas Malone, wrote of Jefferson’s views on the dangers of judicial activism. In Volume 6 of his series Jefferson and His Time: The Sage of Monticello, he cites a letter that Jefferson wrote to a William Charles Jarvis of Massachusetts. Jefferson was responding to something the man had sent him to read and which Jefferson felt had included the erroneous doctrine that Judges were the ultimate arbiters in all constitutional matters.  Jefferson says that he knows of “no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves” and that the power did not belong to a judicial oligarchy. The very first Supreme Court Justice, John Jay, said, “Americans should select and prefer Christians as their rulers.”- Truth! The exact quote is “Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.” Jay wrote it in a private letter to Jedidiah Morse in 1797.

"Judge Roy Moore-10 Commandments","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/roymoore/"," The eRumor encourages       support for Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore who was ordered       by a U.S. appeals court to remove The Ten Commandments from a state       judicial building. The judge has refused to remove it. "," The story is true. Judge Moore was suspended from his post and charged with six ethics violations for refusing to remove the granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Supreme Court building by August 20, 2003. On November 13, 2004, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary expelled Moore from his position as Chief Justice. It all began in 1995 when the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Moore for his practice of opening court sessions in prayer and for a hand-carved wooden plaque of the Ten Commandments that hangs in his courtroom. They said it violates the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution. At the time, Moore was a state circuit court judge but he was later elected as the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 2001, he had a 5,280-pound granite monument of The Ten Commandments placed in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court. Moore says no taxpayer money was used to purchase or place the monument. In October of 2001, the Alabama ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed suit demanding that the granite monument be removed. A U.S. District court judge ordered Moore to remove the monument, but he refused saying that to do so would violate his oath of office because he has vowed to uphold the law, the foundation of which is The Ten Commandments. Then the case went to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ordered the August 20 removal date and threatened fines of $5,000 per day for the first week with that amount doubling each week thereafter. last updated 11/13/03 ","Government"
"A U.S. Federal Appeals Court has ruled the Pledge of Allegianceunconstitutional -Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pledge/"," The eRumor says that the       9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has decided that because the U.S.       Pledge of Allegiance mentions God, it is unconstitutional because of       the separation of church and state.  Follow-up versions say        that the suit that brought the decision is a sham because the        atheist who filed it isn’t the only one with parental authority        over the child who was allegedly injured by the pledge and that        the child is a Christian. "," As with many legal cases, especially constitutional ones, this is a complex issue. First, the story about the Appeals Court decision is true.  On 6/26/02 the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals ruled that the pledge of allegiance in public schools was and “unconstitutional endorsement of religion” because of the phrase “under God.” The next day Circuit Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, who wrote the opinion, blocked his own ruling until all the members of the 9th circuit decide whether to reconsider the case.  They can choose to hear the case again with a three judge panel or or an eleven member panel.  U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said his department would request the eleven.  The ruling and the decision to block the ruling have no effect on the schools affected by the decision since it had not gone into effect.  The decision would affect schools in 9 western states. The decision prompted a national outcry. At the heart of the controversy is Michael Newdow, a California emergency room physician with a law degree who has initiated several court actions acting as his own attorney.  In this case, he sued the El Grove, California school district, challenging the constitutionality of teachers being required to lead the students in the Pledge of Allegiance since it included the phrase “under God.”  The school district asked a judge to dismiss the complaint, which he did.  Newdow appealed to the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals.  In his appeal, Newdow said that his 8-year-old daughter is injured when she is compelled to watch and listen as the teacher leads her classmates in the pledge. Shortly after the appeals court ruling, however, new facts started emerging about Newdow and his daughter that, at the very least, brought criticism of Newdow and, at the very most, prompted some legal experts to say that he might not have a case. The mother of Newdow’s child is Sandra Banning, also of the Sacramento area.  Several articles including one from the Associated Press on July 11, 2002, quoted Banning as saying that she and Newdow have never been married, that she has full custody of their daughter, that both she and the daughter are Christians who attend church regularly, and that the daughter is not only not injured by reciting the pledge, but enjoys doing it. The AP article quotes Rory Little, a Hastings College of the Law professor who follows the 9th Circuit, as saying that the case could only be heard if there was an injured party and without that, there is no case.  There is also some question about the viability of his case if he does not have any custody of his daughter. Newdow is fighting the custody agreement in court. He has also filed an appeal to another court action of his that was dismissed.  That one was filed against President Bush, objecting to a prayer by Bill Graham at his inauguration. ","Government"

"," This is a puzzling story.  Home Depot confirmed at the beginning of June, 2002 that it was not doing business with the U.S. government or any government contractors, but denied it had anything to do with Iraq. A statement on the Home Depot website said “Since we have never been a federally approved contractor, our intent was to re-state our existing policy for our stores and associates and remind them of their responsibilities in complying with related rules.”  Whatever that meant. Then later in June, 2002, Home Depot issued a statement saying it   was going to pursue government business.  The statement said   the change in position was based on “feedback from its associates, customers and a further evaluation of the   systems and administrative requirements necessary to become a   federal contractor.” The National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) tried to make sense of it too.  They said that Home Depot had said it   was actually not a new policy but that letters to stores about the decision had been sent only in the weeks before it became a public   controversy.  The NECA said that commercial credit card customers were receiving notices with their June bills asking that they not make purchases that would make Home Depot compliant with three Federal laws.  The first was an Executive Order from the era of President Johnson in 1965 that prohibited government contractors from discriminating in employment applications on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  The second was a section of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that said that federal contractors and subcontractors with government contracts in excess of $10,000 were required to take affirmative action to “employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities.”  The third was the Veterans´ Readjustment Assistance Act (1974) that   said that contractors and subcontractors with contracts of $25,000 or more must “provide equal opportunity and affirmative action for Vietnam era veterans, special disabled veterans, and veterans who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.” The NECA said that government employees and contractors who had   previously done business with Home Depot were finding themselves   turned away. In 2003 Home Depot released details of what the company had done to be supportive of the troops in Iraq.  That included extending leaves of absence for 1,800 employees who have been deployed, assuring them of jobs when they return home, equalizing their pay differential, and keeping health benefits in force for their families.  Home Depot said that in 2004 it also donated $1 million in tools and materials to support the U.S. military efforts in Iraq, in 2003-2004 donated 1 million hours of volunteer service along with another $1 million to help military families with home repairs, and in 2005 donated $250,000 to help refurbish 10 USO centers in the United States.

Later, another similar case came up involving a woman named Sultaana Freeman who wore a covering that allowed only her eyes to be seen.  She was told she would have to remove it for the photo.  She refused and filed a lawsuit. She lost and in June, 2003, she was told that if she wanted a driver’s license, she would have to consent to having a picture taken with her face uncovered.

"Do Not Call lists and scams about them-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donotcall/"," This says that someone received a card in the mail offering free soft drinks. But the fine print on the card said that by responding to the offer, that person could be called by the sponsors or the co-sponsors of the offer even if the person had been protected by being included in a “do not call” list. "," TruthOrFiction.com has received numerous copies of this particular eRumor, but has not yet actually seen one of the alleged cards offering the soft-drinks. We have evidence, however, that this tactic is being increasingly used by businesses that want to try to disarm the “do not call lists.” Consumers have been angered by the volume and the nature of unsolicited telephone calls. Even unlisted numbers are not protected because of telemarketers who use automated dialing equipment. Additionally, there are annoying auto-dialers that constantly “test” your number and hang-up to see what times of the day somebody answers the phone to a telemarketer can call back during those times. Many states have established “do not call lists” which allow consumers to list the telephone numbers they do not want telemarketers to call. Additionally, In the U.S., there has been a federal do not call registry established at http://www.donotcall.gov/ It is operated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That blocks most telemarketers from calling your numbers. Some organizations, such as non-profit charities, political organizations, or pollsters are still allowed to call. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission is warning about a scam that is based on the “do not call” registry. Scammers are making telephone calls to offer consumers the opportunity to put their numbers into a “do not call” registry and ask for personal information. Some of the calls seek to confirm your alleged registry on the “do not call” list. Some try to get you to pay for your listing with a credit card. None of the registries initiates telephone calls to consumers or charges anything for listing your numbers..The telemarketers are hopping mad about the do not call lists and are attempting to fight them in court. Meantime, some of them are including fine print in their communications with consumers that is designed to allow them or their affiliates to call the consumers regardless of being on a government “do not call” list For example, a long page of fine print at www.catalog.com includes the words, <b”>By completing the forms on this website, you agree the sponsors or co-sponsors of of this contest may telephone you, even if your number is found on a “ do not call ” registry or list.

"," The bills, S.89 and H.R.163 are real. But they are not new. An eRumor started circulating in June, 2004 warning that the draft was only a year away. In reality, these twin bills have existed since 2003 and have never gotten out of committees. In other words, they are stagnant. Nobody in Washington seriously expects a draft and certainly not by 2005. It’s known as the “reinstate draft” bill or the “Universal National Service Act of 2003.” The wording of the bill says it is “To provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.” It would require U.S. citizens and other residents, both male and female, between the ages of 18 and 26 to serve two years of “national service.” The reason the bills have gotten attention in 2004 is the military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the war on terrorism. There has been debate about troop strength in Iraq and the status of all the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Selective Service, however, says that despite the Internet stories, the agency is not getting ready to conduct a draft. It says it is ready to do so should the President and Congress decide, but “that responsibility has been ongoing since 1980 and is nothing new.” The Selective Service further says that “…both the President and the Secretary of Defense have stated on more than one occasion that there is no need for a draft for the War on Terrorism or any likely contingency, such as Iraq.

Most of these statements were during the debate over whether to use force against Iraq. "," There are several quotes. Most of them come during a time in the Clinton administration when decisions were being made about action against Saddam Hussein and amid concerns about weapons of mass destruction. We’ll take them one at a time. “One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.” President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998- Truth! This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq. “If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program.” President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998- Truth! Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. His remarks followed that briefing. “Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.” Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998- Truth! This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton. “He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.” Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998- Truth! This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. “We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998- Truth! According to the U.S. Senate website, the text of this letter was signed by several Senators, both Democrat and Republican, including Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. “Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 – Truth! The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website. “Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.” Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999- Truth! This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago. She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country.  Albright said, “There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It’s just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies.” “There is no doubt that … Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 Truth! The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman. It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq. “We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.” Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002- Truth! These were remarks from Senator Levin to a Senate committee on that date. “We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! This and the quote below was part of prepared remarks for a speech in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club. “Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! “We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002- Truth! Part of a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins. “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons…” Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002- Truth! On the floor of the Senate during debate over the resolution that would authorize using force against Iraq. He was urging caution about going to war and commented that even though there was confidence about the weapons in Iraq, there had not been the need to take military action for a number of years and he asked why there would be the need at that point. “I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force– if necessary– to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002- Truth! Senator Kerry’s comments were made to the Senate as part of the same debate over the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein. “There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years … We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Rockefeller’s statements were a part of the debate over using force against Saddam Hussein. “He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do” Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Waxman’s contribution to the Senate debate over going to war. “In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members.  It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Clinton acknowledged the threat of Saddam Hussein but said she did not feel that using force at that time was a good option. “Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation … And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …” Sen.

"," The letter was written by poet, playwright, and journalist Claire Braz-Valentine, according to her office. The widely-publicized event of blue draperies being installed in front of the statue is true as well. The statue is one of two that stand at the end of the Great Hall in the Justice Department, which is commonly used for news conferences and announcements.  One of statues is known as “The Majesty of Justice” and is a male figure.  The other is called “The Spirit of Justice” and is the female figure.  They are both art-deco pieces cast in aluminum.  The female figure is dressed in a toga, leaving one breast exposed. Attorney General John Ashcroft has not issued any official statement that we know of about the statue issue.  The story was broken by Beverly Lumpkin of ABC News who said Ashcroft had made the request for the draperies.  The Justice department has said that the draperies were an aesthetic decision that allowed the room to be changed for various functions and that the blue draperies looked good on camera. Critics say the drapery is a reflection of Ashcroft’s conservative Christian view of things and that covering the breast seems to be an odd priority compared with other important issues for the Justice department to pay attention to. Supporters say Ashcroft has no problem with the art or the exposed breast but has gotten tired of photographers strategically positioning themselves to snap pictures of Ashcroft or other officials framed with the breast.  They say it is the photographers who have caused the breast to be an issue, not Ashcroft. The same issue came up in 1968 when then Attorney General Edwin Meese presented his commission’s REPORT ON PORNOGRAPHY to reporters in The Great Hall.  Several of the photographers took pains to get pictures of Meese holding up the report with “The Spirit of Justice” and her exposed breast prominently displayed in the background.

TruthorFiction.com reached out to Dr. Rustebakke to confirm whether or not he wrote the letter. Future updates will be posted here. African Horse Sickness dates back to the 1950s. A major epidemic spread through Africa from 1959-1961 and reached as far as Arabia, Pakistan and India. In all, 300,000 horses were killed in that outbreak. More recently, African Horse Sickness outbreaks have been reported in a number of sub-Saharan countries in Africa, according to the Merck Veterinary Manual . It’s true that USDA requires that horses imported from countries affected by African Horse Sickness be quarantined for 60 days before entering the U.S, according to the American Horse Council . It’s also true that screening and quarantine requirements for Ebola are more lax. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Ebola travel restrictions on October 22, 2014. Passengers who travel from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were required to fly into one of five airports that had enhanced screening and additional resources in place.

Mencken prophesied 94 years ago that a “downright moron” would someday adorn the White House. "," This eRumor was taken from a “prophecy” that Mencken made in the last paragraph of an essay that appeared in the Baltimore Evening Sun on July 26, 1920. The essay, which was called “Bayard vs. Lionheart,” was later collected in a book by Mencken titled “ On Politics: A Carnival of Buncombe .” Taken in a broader context, Mencken’s quote was about the challenges future presidential candidates would face in connecting with a growing nationwide electorate: The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by the force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notions that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron. Mencken was nicknamed the Sage of Baltimore and was a well-known journalist and author before his death in 1956. He was an outspoken advocate of the First Amendment and civil liberties, according to the Friends of the H.L. Mencken House website . Posted  05/14/14 ","Government"

"Illegal Immigrants Cost U.S. Taxpayers $338.3 Billion a Year-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-immigrants-costs/"," Illegal aliens cost federal, state and local governments $338.3 billion a year. "," Studies on how much illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers each year vary greatly, but the eRumor’s claim that the total cost is $338.3 billion a year is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) studied 29 different reports on the impact of unauthorized immigrants on state and local government budgets in 2007. “It is important to note, though, that currently available estimates have significant limitations; therefore, using them to determine an aggregate effect across all states would be difficult and prone to considerable error,” the CBO said. No comprehensive data has been compiled on how much state and local governments spend on services for illegal immigrants, but individual studies from both ends of the political spectrum are at odds with the eRumor’s claim that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers $338.3 billion a year. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research think tank, estimated in 2013 that the aggregate annual deficit for all unlawful citizens was about $54.4 billion. The “aggregate amount” is the total cost of benefits and services received by all unlawful immigrant households, with the taxes they paid subtracted. The CBO study concluded that about half of illegal aliens pay taxes, and that they receive more benefits from state and local governments than they pay for. “The estimates that CBO reviewed measured costs associated with providing services to unauthorized immigrants that ranged from a few million dollars in states with small unauthorized populations to tens of billions of dollars in California,” the CBO said. Education, health care and law enforcement were the highest areas of state and local spending on illegal immigrants. The CBO found, however, that unauthorized immigrants accounted for no more than 5 percent of total state spending on those services. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 established citizenship requirements in order to receive most federal benefits. When the bill was signed into law, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cut federal spending by $54.1 billion over six years. Restrictions on benefits for non-citizens were expected to account for 44 percent, or about $23.7 billion, of the total cost savings. However, much of the expected cost savings were “undone” by actions taken by state governments to provide benefits to immigrants who were affected by federal welfare reform. Some aspects of the law also weren’t fully implemented, according to a report by the Centers for Immigration Studies. Although studies and estimates vary greatly, available data does not support the eRumor’s claim that U.S. taxpayers spend $338.3 billion on illegal immigrants each year.

"Trey Gowdy’s Tough Questions for the Media-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trey-gowdy-conference/"," This is a forwarded email alleging that Congressman Trey Gowdy (R-SC) addressed the media with important questions that they overlooked in the coverage of the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi. "," The video is real and was taken from a press conference on Capital Hill in October 30, 2013. This according to a May 19, 2014, article by Rush Limbaugh. The Daily Caller confirmed the press conference but reported the date inaccurately. Gowdy was appointed by Congress to head up the investigation of the September 11, 2012 death of Ambassador Stevens and attack on the U.S. Consulate at Benghazi, Libya. The video went viral during in early May 2014. Real Clear politics posted a transcript of Gowdy’s statement: REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC): “We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act in Benghazi, and make no mistake, justice will be done.” That was the president of the United States over a year ago. “We’re investigating exactly what happened, but my biggest priority now is bringing those folks to justice.” That was the president of the United States over a year ago. No one has been arrested. No one has been prosecuted. No one has been brought to justice. We don’t even have access to the witnesses. You in the media were good enough for my 16 years as a prosecutor not to tell me how to do my job, and so far in Congress, y’all have been good enough not to tell me how to do my job. I’m not telling you how to do your job. But I’m going to ask you some questions, and if you can’t answer these questions, then I’ll leave you to draw whatever conclusion you want to draw about whether or not the media has provided sufficient oversight. Can you tell me why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi the night that he was killed? Do you know? Does it bother you whether or not you know why Chris Stevens was in Benghazi? Do you know why we were the last flag flying in Benghazi after the British had left and the Red Cross had been bombed? Do you know why requests for additional security were denied? Do you know why an ambassador asking for more security days and weeks before he was murdered and those requests went unheeded? Do you know the answer to why those requests went unheeded? Do you know why no assets were deployed during the siege? And I’ve heard the explanation — which defies logic, frankly — that we couldn’t have gotten there in time, but you know, they didn’t know when it was going to end. So how can you possibly cite that as an excuse? Do you know whether the president called any of our allies and said, “Can you help? We have men under attack.” Can you answer that? Do any of you know why Susan Rice was picked? The secretary of state did not go. She says she doesn’t like Sunday talk shows. That’s the only media venue she does not like, if that’s true. Why was Susan Rice on the five Sunday talk shows? Do you know the origin of this mythology that it was spawned as a spontaneous reaction to a video? Do you know where that started? Do you know how we got from no evidence of that to that being the official position of the administration? In conclusion, Congress is supposed to provide oversight, the voters are supposed to provide oversight, and you are supposed to provide oversight. That’s why you have special liberties, and that’s why you have special protections. I am not surprised that the president of the United States called this a phony scandal. I’m not surprised Secretary Clinton asked, “What difference does it make?” I’m not even surprised that Jay Carney said Benghazi happened a long time ago. I’m just surprised at how many people bought it. Posted 05/19/14 ","Government"
"Former Marine Arrested in Crack Down on Anti-Government Commenters -Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/former-marine-arrested/"," Forwarded emails claim that a former Marine was detained for making anti-government comments on social media, and that the case proves there is a larger government effort to crackdown on government critics. "," It’s true that a former Marine was held for psychiatric evaluation after authorities were tipped-off about cryptic anti-government Facebook posts he made. The case doesn’t, however, prove that a larger crackdown on people who post anti-government comments on social media sites is underway. Police from Chesterfield, Virginia, detained former Marine Brandon Raub for a mental health evaluation on August 16, 2012. Police and FBI agents had been dispatched to Raub’s home to investigate a complaint that his Facebook posts had grown increasingly dark. Chesterfield Police said county mental health crisis intervention workers determined that Raub should be held under a temporary detention order and taken to a hospital for further evaluation based on his interactions with police. Raub was held in psychiatric care until a county judge ordered his release on August 23, 2012. In his ruling, the judge said Raub had suffered “a deprivation of liberty,” an NBC News affiliate reports . No criminal charges were filed in the case. In May 2013, attorneys for the Rutherford Institute, an organization that says it defends civil liberties, filed a civil lawsuit on Raub’s behalf. The lawsuit sought damages for alleged violations of Raub’s First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In March 2014, a federal judge dismissed the case and said mental health workers had acted reasonably in recommending Raub’s detention, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports . Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute appealed the decision in August 2014. The appeal says a former Marine who served with Raub in Iraq had tipped-off authorities about Raub’s Facebook posts. Some of the posts called for the arrests of President George W. Bush and President H.W. Bush and claimed that the U.S. government had orchestrated 9/11. Raub also talked about how revolution could lead to the former presidents’ demise. Another passage that drew attention stated, “Sharpen up my axe; I’m here to severe heads.” Raub later argued that the passage was intended to be “metaphorical” and said it was a song lyric. Authorities determined that Raub’s messages didn’t include specific threats of violence and didn’t rise to a criminal level. The eRumor’s claims about a larger ant-government crackdown may be based on “Operation Vigilant Eagle.” The FBI launched the program in April 2009 to target white supremacists and “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reports . FBI memos stated that the Vigilant Eagle program was designed to “share information regarding Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans whose involvement in white supremacy and/or militia sovereign citizen extremist groups poses a domestic terrorism threat.” However, the FBI didn’t detain Raub as part of Vigilant Eagle. Local authorities ordered Raub held for psychiatric evaluation based on his interactions with police, not based on his Facebook posts. Posted 10/31/14 ","Government"

"," Blog posts that allege Bill Gates has admitted to the existence of chemtrails and has funded research for geoengineering are true. Gates first said geoengineering research, which includes chemtrails, could delay the impact of global warming by 20 or 30 years at a 2010 TED Talks event on geoengineering in Lithuania. “That’s just an insurance policy, and you’d hope you wouldn’t need to do that,” Gates said. “Some say we shouldn’t even work on the insurance policy… I’m not sure that’s wise, given the importance of the problem. “ A video of the TED Talks event can be viewed here . Gates went one step further in 2012. He established a multi-million fund for a small team of Harvard researchers to study geoengineering, the Guardian reported . “The objective is not to alter the climate, but simply to probe the processes at a micro scale,” David Keith, one of the researchers, told the Guardian. “The direct risk is very small.” There’s nothing illegal about the research, either. Small-scale research on chemtrails is allowed under a moratorium placed on geoengineering by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010. “…No climate-related geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity (may) take place, until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities and appropriate consideration of the associated risks for the environment and biodiversity and associated social, economic and cultural impacts, with the exception of small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting,” the group said.

"A tax refund on 2006 forms for excise tax on long-distance phonecalls-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/exisetax/"," The IRS is offering a tax credit on 2006 tax forms for money paid in excise taxes on telephone calls. "," The eRumor is long, detailed, and complicated but it is true that on your tax forms for the 2006 tax year in the U.S. you can claim a tax credit because of a change in the collection of Federal excise taxes on telephone calls.  This is because of federal court decisions ruling that the tax no longer applies to long distance calls the way they are billed today. It applies to land-line, cellular, and even Internet calls. Here are some of the details: -Excise taxes on long-distance telephone service was halted beginning August 1, 2006. -Refunds are being offered to individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations for excise taxes paid on long-distance service between February 28, 2003 and August 1, 2006. -If you want to go to the trouble of actually assembling all the telephone bills for that period, you can do it and get a refund on the actual taxes you paid, but for convenience there is a simpler way to do it. If you claim one exemption, the refund is $30 If you claim two exemptions, the refund is $40 If you claim three exemptions, the refund is $50 If you claim four exemptions or more, the refund is $60. -You do not need to itemize deductions.  The tax credit will be offered on all individual tax forms for 2006 taxes. -For businesses and non-profits, the IRS has come up with a formula for a refund.  Check with your tax preparer for details. Historically, the long-distance excise tax was based on the time and distance of a call.  But in the 1990s more telephone companies started charging for long-distance calls without regard to distance and court challenges argued that the tax should not longer be levied.

"Doe Run Smelter to Shut Down Operations-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doe-run-smelter/"," This is a forwarded email about the Doe Run Company located in Herculaneum, Missouri.   The email said that the smelter, that has been in operation since 1892, is being shut down because the company can not meet the emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "," It is true that Doe Run is shutting down the smelter that has been in operation since 1892. This is the last primary lead smelter in the U.S. and the Doe Run Company, citing a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency,  issued the following release on their website : The Doe Run Company (Doe Run) has issued the following response related to the company’s Herculaneum, Mo., smelter: On Dec. 31, 2013, The Doe Run Company’s primary lead smelter in Herculaneum, Mo., which has operated since 1892, will cease operations. As a result of the smelter’s closure, 145 Doe Run employees, and approximately 73 contractors, will lose their jobs. Seventy-five positions will be retained for closure and limited operations. Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States. (Primary smelters produce lead from mined resources.) In 2010, Doe Run reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Missouri. As part of that settlement, the Company agreed to discontinue its smelting operations in Herculaneum by the end of 2013. Over the operating life of the smelter, the Company spent millions of dollars in environmental and other upgrades. Continuing to upgrade the aging smelter to attempt to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations imposed on primary lead smelters was not economically feasible given the many other requirements of our business.* We shared this news in 2010 in a press release available on our website. The Company had hoped to bring a revolutionary lead metal production technology online prior to the closure of the smelter. This proprietary, new technology (also announced in 2010) uses a wet-chemical, electrowinning process instead of a heat-based smelting process, greatly reducing sulfur dioxide and lead emissions. In 2012, we announced that the cost to build a comparably-sized electrowinning plant was too great for our company, given the present economic conditions and other demands on our operations. We continue to pursue opportunities to bring this technology to commercialization, perhaps on a smaller scale. This past year, we have worked with our Herculaneum employees to help them transition into new opportunities. Some have taken jobs within other divisions of our company; others have found new careers. Those who remain have been provided skill assessment and training, resume and interviewing skill building, financial counseling and a variety of services. We have a dedicated, hardworking and skilled workforce and we are making every effort to help them transition successfully. As noted above, we expect to keep approximately 75 employees at our Herculaneum facility in 2014 to assist with the continuing operations, including refining and alloying of lead metal, and closure of our site. More than 80 percent of all lead produced in the U.S. is used in either motive batteries to start vehicles, or in stationary batteries for backup power (particular in military, telecom and medical applications). In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making  lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product. These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri. Lead is used in numerous other products, including ammunition and construction materials, as well as to protect against radiation in medical and military applications. While most applications can use secondary lead, those applications that require primary lead will need to import the lead metal in the future. Any additional demand for lead (above that which can be met through recycling at secondary smelters) will also have to be met through imports. *In 2008, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead was reduced from 1.5 µg/m3 (micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air) to 0.15 µg/m3.

Note:  New laws regarding the use of cell phones do go into effect in California in July, 2008.  Details about that are listed at the bottom of this article. It didn’t take long for someone to start circulating it as applying to Texas and Georgia and more states will probably be added along the way. Most of it is not true. The Texas Department of Public Safety quickly issued a release saying that there were not any new laws scheduled to go into effect in July, 2007. That left the California question to be dealt with. We’ll go through each of the items one at a time, but first there are not statewide mandated penalties for traffic fines in California. There are guidelines from what is called the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule but local jurisdictions make their own decisions on fines for traffic citations.  You may have discovered that on your own if you’ve gotten a traffic ticket for the same violation in different California cities or counties.  You did not necessarily get the same fine. If you want to know what the typical fines are in your area, call your local traffic court. 1. Carpool lane – 1st time $1068.50 starting 7/1/07 (The $271 posted on the highway is old). Don’t do it again because 2nd time is going to be double. 3rd time triple, and 4th time license suspended- Fiction! In 2007, the recommended fine for a first time car pool violation was $380.  Repeat offenders can expect to pay more, but nothing near the amounts represented in this email. 2. Incorrect lane change – $380. Don’t cross the lane on solid lines or intersections- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $134 for a typical infraction. 3. Block intersection – $485- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $175. 4. Driving on the shoulder – $450- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $134. 5. Cell phone use in the construction zone. – Double fine as of 07/01/07.  Cell phone use must be “hands free” while driving- Fiction! There was no law in California during 2007 restricting the use of cell phones in the car. There was such a law going into effect in July, 2008.   There was no “double fine” as of 7/1/07 because there was no law in effect regarding cell phones.  The new California law does not mention construction zones although penalties for traffic violations are higher if they occurred in a highway construction or maintenance area. 6. Passengers over 18 not in their seatbelts – both passengers and drivers get tickets- Truth! The California Mandatory Seat Belt Law requires all passengers to use some kind of restraint.   Children under 6 and weighing less than 60 pounds are required to be in “specified child passenger restraint system,” typically a car seat.

The law prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from using any type of wireless device while driving, except in an emergency situation. Q: Can a law enforcement officer stop me for using my hands-free device while driving? A: No. For drivers under the age of 18, this is considered a SECONDARY violation meaning that a law enforcement officer may cite you for using a hands-free wireless phone if you were pulled over for another violation. However, the prohibition against using a handheld wireless telephone while driving is a PRIMARY violation for which a law enforcement officer can pull you over. Updated 3/15/08 ","Government"

"Tonopah Solar Company $737 Million Government Loan For Solar Project-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tonopah/"," A solar energy project in Nevada will create 45 permanent jobs and cost the federal government $737 million, or more than $16 million per job. Also, the brother-in-law of House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stands to gain financially from the project. "," This viral email circling the Internet makes false claims and misrepresents a solar energy project in Nevada in an attempt to make a point about wasteful government spending. In 2011, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced finalization of a $737 million loan guarantee for Tonopah Solar Energy to develop the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project on land leased by the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada. The new facility will employ 45 full-time employees upon completion, but the eRumor’s claim that the jobs will each cost the federal government more than $16 million is false because it misinterprets what a loan guarantee is. According to Investopedia.com , a government agency agrees to purchase the remaining balance of a loan if a borrower defaults through a loan guarantee. So, a $737 million loan guarantee merely means the government could pay up to $737 million if Tonopah Solar Energy defaulted on the entire balance of the project. Unless the company defaults on the loan, the government won’t pay anything. Aside from that, SolarReserve, LLC, the developer sponsoring construction of the 110-megawatt concentrating solar power tower, noted on its website that the project would create 4,300 additional direct, indirect and induced jobs over a 30-month construction period that began in October 2013. And the eRumor’s claim about the role of Rep. Pelosi’s brother-in-law, Ronald Pelosi, with PCG is based in fact, but it misrepresented the connection. The S an Francisco Chronicle reported in 2011 that Ronald Pelosi was an executive of the private equity firm that owns a 2 percent equity stake in SolarReserve. But a PCG official said Ronald Pelosi joined the firm after it purchased the equity stake, and he won’t benefit from it because he doesn’t own interest in the fund that created that investment.

The FBI’s current system can only track data on up to 11 victims per incident, which means large-scale killings like the one that unfolded on Virginia Tech’s campus in Blacksburg, Virginia, in 2007 had to be broken up into multiple records. FBI crime data for 2007 doesn’t reflect those 32 murders, either. An FBI spokesperson told USA Today that the bureau hopes to install a new computer system by the end of 2014 that will be able to track homicide data in “nearly real time.” Posted 11/14/14 ","Government"
"Sandy Hook Shooting Was Staged by the Government-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sandy-hook-shooting-conspiracy-theory/"," Blog posts and articles circling the Web allege that the federal government staged the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School to shore up support for new gun control laws. "," Many of the theories surrounding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are based on personal opinions that cannot be definitively proven true or false — so this eRumor remains unproven. An official review of state and local law enforcement agencies’ response to the shooting, however, contradicts the claim that there were irregularities in the police response to the situation. A Connecticut Police Chiefs Association report found that officers made entry to the building less than nine minutes after the first emergency call was received at 9:35 a.m. The shooter committed suicide within two minutes of officers arriving. The report continued: State and local police continued to search the building and quickly triaged any victims they discovered. A Newtown Officer found a critically injured child, since EMS had not been cleared to approach the building; the officer scooped up the child and sprinted toward the EMS staging area. This is recorded by in-car video at 09:56:16 hours. Soon after, officers and troopers found other children and adults in the immediate vicinity of the suspect and led them out of the building. In-car video shows the wounded and trapped being shuttled out of the building from 09:58:39 hours on. This continued until the building was emptied. That report states that New Town, Conn., police officers correctly prioritized neutralizing the shooter before providing clearance for emergency response efforts to proceed. No information is available regarding what time the first media broadcast went live from the scene, so it’s impossible to determine what phase of the response television viewers first witnessed. Media outlets traditionally do not broadcast live footage from active crime scenes that involve shooters because it could allow the perpetrator to gain a tactical advantage over officers who are responding, or expose viewers to gruesome images of victims. The claim that New Hampshire Gov. Dan Malloy said he had been spoken to about how “something like this may happen” on Dec. 12, 2012, is true, according to a video of the press conference. “Earlier today, a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community,” Malloy said. “The lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to in attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident.” The claim that Robbie Parker, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School victim Emily Parker, is an actor appears to be based on speculation, not credible evidence.

"Social Security for Illegal Immigrants who have not contributed? Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/petition-illegals/"," A couple of these are circulating, both in the form of petitions. One says that the U.S. Senate has voted to allow illegal aliens to collect on Social Security even though they have not paid into the Social Security System. Another is an internet petition originated by Californians that is to be sent to President Bush, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and several members of Congress from California.  It says that the U.S. Senate voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants and protests it..  It asks that citizenship be required for eligibility for Social Services, that no free services or funding be given to illegal immigrants, and that no college education be provided free to illegals either. "," First, Internet petitions have, so far, been of limited or no value.  They do not bear the same weight of signed petitions since anybody who wants to take the time could generate them and just make up the names.  These petitions also depend on someone to ultimately send them to the right addresses, which is not a reliable way to get them there. Second, let’s look at each of the issues in the eRumors. The Senate Vote on Social Security that generated this petition was in May, 2006. The effect of that vote was to allow language in other legislation on the issue to proceed.  It would not have granted Social Security benefits to all illegal aliens but it would have allowed illegal aliens who had already paid into Social Security to accrue the benefits of their contributions.  The Senate went on to pass a controversial immigration bill but it differed greatly from a version passed in the House of Representatives. Social Security As of this writing, Illegal immigrants are not benefiting much from Social Security.  It’s technically illegal to hire an undocumented worker so theoretically there should not be any paying into Social Security.  But because of so many illegal workers who use bogus Social Security cards to get jobs, billions of dollars of Social Security deductions are made each year as well as employer payments into Social Security on behalf of those workers. Illegals are not supposed to collect on Social Security and because their Social Security numbers are manufactured, they cannot collect so the money has become a part of the controversy over Illegal immigration.  There have been some estimates that more than $60 billion a year are being paid into the system because of illegal immigrants, money that would disappear if the immigrants did. Immigration reform being debated in Congress could affect all this such as if amnesty is granted to illegal aliens currently residing in the U.S. or if illegal aliens are given some kind of participation in the Social Security system.  There is no legislation, however, that would give illegal aliens Social Security payments if they have not paid into Social Security. Social Services Let’s look at this from the standpoint of California since that is the concern of the petition and is the state with the largest population of illegal immigrants. A wide range of services are available in California for illegal immigrants including health care and education for children. College Tuition At present in-state college tuition rates are available to undocumented immigrants as long as they meet other standards such as residency requirements. Updated 3/30/07 ","Government"

Adam Clymer is a journalist who covered Washington for the New York Times who had been writing about Ted Kennedy since he played football for Harvard in the 1950’s. Clymer wrote a book called, Edward M. Kennedy: a biography based on personal interviews with the senator as well as published reports. According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy was expelled only once from Harvard, not twice, and he never paid a classmate to cheat for him. According to Clymer, it was in 1951 that Kennedy had a fellow student named Bill Frate take his Spanish exam. Kennedy was concerned his C -minus grade could result in his removal from the Harvard football team. Clymer said, there was no monetary compensation for the cheating episode and as a friend, Frate agreed to take the test in Kennedy’s name. Frate was recognized by a graduate student who proctored the exam when the exam was handed in. The two were reported to and shortly afterwards expelled from the university. They were told that they could reapply in one or two years if their conduct improved. Ted returned to Harvard after 1953 where he worked harder in his studies and earned an A minus in Spanish and eventually graduated with a Bachelors degree in 1956. 2. Kennedy enlisted in the Army for four years.  His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England, intervened to have his enlistment shortened to two years. Truth! According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy spent three or four weeks figuring out what he was going to do after his expulsion from Harvard and on June 25, 1951 enlisted in the U.S. Army.   The Korean War was already a year old and the young Kennedy, unaware of the student deferment policy signed induction papers for a four year term.   Having already lost a son in World War II, His father, Joseph Kennedy, was able to intervene in Teddy’s behalf and reduced his hitch in the Army by two years. 3. While in the Army, Kennedy was assigned to Paris but never advanced beyond the rank of Private. Truth! Clymer said that, after basic training at Fort Dix, in New Jersey Private Kennedy was assigned to Camp Gordon in Georgia for three months for military police training. There were a couple of incidents that resulted in a lot of latrine duty for Kennedy. Among them was a incident when on a cold night he tried to keep warm using a can of Sterno, a fuel made from jellied and denatured alcohol. It caused a fire when his sleeping bag ignited. Once again, at the intervention of Joe Kennedy, the Private was assigned as part of the honor guard for the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Paris, France. Kennedy received an honorable discharge from the US Army in 1953 at the rank of Private. 4. While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving four times. Unproven! Kennedy did attend the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville. His biographer said that Kennedy “drove wildly and got several speeding tickets.” The book also said that he once out ran a police car. 5. In 1964, Kennedy was legally intoxicated when his plane crashed.  He hospitalized for several months. The results of the blood alcohol test remained a “state secret” until in the 1980’s. Fiction! This makes it sound as though Kennedy was the pilot and that he was flying drunk. He was a passenger, however, and alcohol had nothing to do with either Kennedy or the accident. The plane crash happened on June 10, 1964. Kennedy, his wife Joan, Indiana Senator Birch Baye, Senator Baye’s wife, and Kennedy’s administrative assistant, Ed Moss, were being flown Washington D.C. to West Springfield, Massachusetts, the location of the Democratic Party Convention. The plane struck the ground during an instrument approach and a later investigation blamed the crash on pilot error. Kennedy was seriously injured in the crash, spent months in rehabilitation, and was plagued with back pain for the rest of his life. The eRumor said that Kennedy had been illegally impaired by alcohol during this crash but Ted Kennedy but he was not the pilot of this plane.   His Blood alcohol level would have no meaning in any investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), CAB or or National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) . 6. On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts and later  drove Mary Jo Kopechne home.  The car ran off the bridge, flipped, and into Poucha Pond and Kopechne drowned.   It is widely assumed Kennedy was drunk.   Kennedy was given a suspended sentence of two months. Truth! and Unproven! This is one of the most famous incidents in Kennedy’s life. It is true that a car that he was driving went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island on July 19, 1969 and that a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne died in the accident. According to Clymer’s book, it was a hot July day on the island and Kennedy had competed in the annual Edgartown Regatta, a sailboat race, earlier and finished in ninth place out of 31 boats. After the race, Kennedy returned to his hotel room, soaked his back in a hot bath and drank a rum and coke. He later went to a reunion of Robert Kennedy campaign workers which was also attended by Mary Jo Kopechne who worked for Robert Kennedy as a legislative aide. It is thought that Kopechne might have been feeling ill from exposure to the sun from the day’s events and Kennedy left the party with her after 11:00 PM to take her back to the inn where she was staying. The fatal accident took place a mile and a half from the cottage where the party was still taking place. The Oldsmobile that Kennedy had been driving went off the bridge on the right side, overturned and landed in the pond where it quickly submerged under the water. Kennedy managed to escape the sinking vehicle but Kopechne didn’t According to published reports, Kennedy stumbled back to the cottage and two other people from the party then went to the scene of the accident and tried to rescue Kopechne, but without success. One of the lingering controversies of the incident is that no one reported it to authorities. Police learned of it from two fishermen the next morning who happened upon the scene. The following day, when the police arrived on the scene and began their investigation Kennedy told them that he was not sure how he had escaped the submerged car and that he dove down to to the point of exhaustion see if his passenger was still in the car. Clymer wrote that the crash left Kennedy with a moderate brain concussion which resulted in memory failure and confusion. Kennedy was charged with leaving the scene of an accident to which he pleaded guilty. Kennedy testified in the inquest that he had only drank two drinks at the party. He was sentenced to 2 months jail time which was suspended. 8. Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years, but his accomplishments seem scant- Fiction! According to the http://www.govtrack.us web site , a civil project that tracks congressional and senate activities, Senator Kennedy Edward Kennedy sponsored 380 bills from Jan 14, 1991. and Aug 6, 2009.     At the time of this investigation 273 of these bills are still in committee and 24 have been successfully enacted. Kennedy also co-sponsored 2047 bills during this period. Kennedy was widely regarded as one of the most powerful senators of his time and below are some of his recently sponsored bills: S. 982: Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act Reported by Committee May 20, 2009 S. 277: Serve America Act Reported by Committee Mar 18, 2009 S. 1405: Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site Designation Act Introduced Jul 7, 2009 S. 1152: Healthy Families Act Introduced May 21, 2009 S. 1410: Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act of 2009 Introduced Jul 8, 2009 S.Res. 36: An original resolution authorizing expenditures by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.

Kennedy was prime instigator and author of every expansion of an increase in immigration, up to and including the latest attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Not to mention the pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court nominees- TRUTH! According to a August 27, 2009 CBS News article , immigration reform was a lifelong cause for Senator Kennedy and he “dramatically changed the United States’ immigration system with the Immigration Act of 1965, which eliminated the quota system and allowed immigration from Latin America and Asia to dramatically increase.”   The article said, “He also worked to pass the Refugee Act of 1980, and in 1986 he supported a measure that allowed nearly three million undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and established penalties against employers who hired illegal immigrants. He supported the Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the number of immigrants that could enter the country, including those who could enter with permanent job-related visas and temporary worker visas.” In 2007 Senators Kennedy cosponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 which failed passage. Because of timing of the original eRumor, it is believed that the two Supreme Court nominees mentioned were Chief Justice John G. Roberts (2005)  and Samuel A. Alito (2006).  Both justices were appointed by President George W. Bush, choices which Kennedy did not approve. The issue of abortion was the key focus in the confirmation hearing of Judge Alito.   In his closing comments during the hearing, Senator Kennedy said, “He didn’t back away one inch from his view that a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions is NOT protected under the Constitution.  He didn’t back away from his criticism of the principle of ‘one person, one vote.'” Kennedy added, “And on the cases he decided, in case after case, we see legal contortions and inconsistent reasoning to bend over backwards to help the powerful. He may cite instances in thish he thinks he helped the little guy. But the record is clear that the average person had a hard time getting a fair shake in Judge Alito’s courtroom.” After the death of William Rehnquist on September 23, 2005,  President George W. Bush nominated John G. Roberts to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. During Robert’s confirmation hearings for Chief Justice, Senator Kennedy said, ” I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States. Sadly, there is ample evidence in John Roberts’ record to indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country’s great march of progress toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has refused to release documents and information from his years in the Reagan Administration and in the first Bush Administration that might indicate otherwise, but without those records, we have no way of knowing.” Kennedy added, “John Roberts’s nomination are trying to force a nominee to adopt our “partisan” positions, to support our “causes,” to yield to our “special interest” agendas.” Kennedy also said, “Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most important functions. The future and the quality of life in this nation may literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a rubber stamp for the President’s nominees, if we put party over principle, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more important if we go along to get along with the White House we will be undermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish the great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and reasonable “no” vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent consciences tell us to do so.” Roberts attended Harvard Law School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review and after passing his bar exam, served as a law clerk for William Rehnquist.   Roberts was confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and later swore into office of the President of the United States another former editor of the Harvard Law Review, Barack Hussein Obama. 10. He is known around Washington as a public drunk, loud, boisterous and very disrespectful to ladies- Mostly True! Kennedy had a well-known problem with alcohol and in his earlier years was described by some as a “womanizer” and a “drunk.” Biographer Edward Klein said Kennedy was “…like the playboy of the Western world.” Klein said that Kennedy could get attention in his family by being the clown. CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller described Kennedy as a prolific elder statesman on one side and a brazen bad boy on the other.” She also said that after Kennedy’s first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in 1980, his reputation with women and booze spun out of control. Klein described a drunken incident in Alaska in 1969. He said Kennedy began yelling “Es-ki-mo Power!” and saying things like “They’re going to shoot my ass off the way they shot Bobby…” After the trip John Lindsey of Newsweek called Kennedy family friend Lester Hyman and told him about the Alaska incident. He said “Your friend Ted Kennedy is in a lot of trouble psychologically.” He was known for his boisterousness and loudness. He was famous for spontaneously bursting forth into song—and at a high volume. In 1991, Time magazine called him a “Palm Beach Boozer” and GQ magazine described him as “an aging Irish boy clutching a bottle.” Most credit his second marriage to Victoria Reggie Kennedy in 1992 as marking a change for the better in his life. updated 09/01/09 ","Government"

"," This eRumor is a combination of fact and fiction. It’s true that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) solicited bids for up to 34 million blank ID cards on October 3, 2014. The bid is for “card consumables” that will be used to make green cards and employment authorization documentation cards over a five-year period. However, the claim that the blank ID cards are needed because an influx in new U.S. citizens will follow planned executive action on immigration reform is false.

Congressman John Boehner (R-OH), in his June 26, 2009 blog entry warned, “Home Sellers Beware. Having a hard time selling your home? Here’s one more hurdle to jump: all home sales are conditioned upon an energy audit and a new energy rating assessment and energy labeling program for your home that’s outlined in the Democrats’ bill. And if you thought you could improve your property with a fresh coat of paint and some granite counters? Think again! Now your home will be subjected to a new energy rating assessment and energy labeling program that will penalize you for older windows, original fixtures, and dated appliances. So the Democrats’ bill would bring down the value of your home!” Doug Willis is a California Real Estate Broker and the creator of a real estate website  “up2date”.  In a June 30,2009 article, Willis points out that there is a provision  in the bill that could take place at a point of sale, meaning before a home transaction could close there would be a required energy audit on the property. Willis speculated that, “Minimum guidelines would probably be developed to determine pass or fail, and then the appropriate repairs or updates would have to be performed to bring your home up to standards.” Click for article. In a follow up July 8, 2009 article , Willis reported that The National Association of REALTORS® (NAR) Government Affairs Division released a report called, “NAR Myths and Facts -The American Clean Energy and Security Act” which addressed the realtor’s concerns.  The report said, the” NAR was successful in getting harmful federal energy audit requirements and point-of sale triggers dropped from the bill.” The NAR reported: Claim: “The bill mandates energy audits and labeling before any home in America is sold.” Fact: The bill does not create a federal energy audit or labeling requirement. As introduced, the original bill would have required energy audits and labeling at the time of sale. However, Realtors succeeded in making many positive changes before the bill passed. Many published reports are not based on the version of the bill that was considered by the House. As approved, the bill: • Does not create energy audit requirement for real property at time of sale. • Exempts existing homes, multifamily and commercial buildings from any federal energy labeling guidelines such as the existing federal Energy Star label program (section 204(m)), and • Leaves the decision entirely to state governments whether to pass a law to require labels, but expressly prohibits labeling during a transaction (Section 204(h)).

"," It’s true that Jonathan Gruber cited the “stupidity of the American voter” in getting the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, signed into law. Gruber first made the controversial comment during a Health and Economics Conference hosted by the Penn Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (PennLDI) in October 2013. “The bill was written in a tortured way to make sure (the Congressional Budget Office) did not score the mandate as taxes,” Gruber said. “Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter, or whatever, but basically that was really critical to get the thing to pass.” The “mandate” that Gruber refers to is ACA’s individual mandate , which requires that Americans purchase health insurance, or face a fine. Gruber went on to say that he wished that “we could make it all more transparent,” but then added, “but I’d rather have this law than not.” Gruber appeared on MSNBC days after the video went viral on November 11, 2014. “The comments in the video were made at an academic conference,” Gruber said. “I was speaking off the cuff, and I basically spoke inappropriately, and I regret making those comments.” But after Gruber’s appearance on MSNBC, Fox News aired a second video in which Gruber referred to the “stupidity” of the American people. In that video, which was recorded at Washington University in St. Louis in October 2013, Gruber was reportedly referring to how the ACA’s Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans was structured. Claims that Gruber was an architect of Obamacare, however, may be over-exaggerated. Gruber’s MIT bio describes him as “a key architect of Massachusetts’ ambitious health reform effort” from 2003-2006.

"," The most incendiary part of this eRumor is the information about a number being required under the skin of the left hand—and it is false.  It hearkens to several other eRumors that have circulated about people being required to have identification chips implanted into their bodies or on their right hands or foreheads, which brings up speculation about Biblical prophecy about “The End Times.” The heart of the eRumor is about the “Federal Tax ID Number.”  There is no such terminology about individual citizens but there has been legislation passed in the U.S. Congress under what was called the REAL ID act and that sought to establish minimum standards for driver’s licenses and identification cards that would be acceptable by Federal Agencies.   The legislation prohibits Federal Agencies from accepting IDs for any official purposes that have not been issued based on the requirements of the act, although some states will get extensions and there will be a phasing-in period of 5-years for everything to be working correctly.  The Department of Homeland Security says this is not a “National ID Card.”  It is simply an attempt to establish common standards for states to issue licenses and identication cards.  The licenses will be issued from each state, not the Federal government. Driver’s licenses are accepted as legitimate ID at airports, for example, when you show up to board a flight.  That means that the issuance of a driver’s license should be based on the kind of documentation that will prove that the person who is getting it is really who he or she claims to be.  The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the reliability and accuracy of ID documents.  The commission report said that for terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons and that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers had some kind of identifying document, some by fraud. Regarding the woman’s ordeal in getting her license, it is not hard to understand what she was required to provide.  If you come to California from another state, a valid driver’s license is accepted as ID for a California license, but not an expired one.  If your name has changed, such as through marriage or divorce, you are required to have the documentation of that change in order to either get a license or have a name changed on a license. The part of the eRumor that says a number will be required under the skin of your left hand may have been prompted by questions about whether some of the states may want to embed what are called RFID devices in the drivers licenses.  RIFD stands for “radio frequency identification” and refers to small, inexpensive chips that are increasingly used for a variety of things including identifying products in stores.  It’s a high-tech electronic substitute for bar codes.  An RIFD chip doesn’t require a battery and merely needs to be passed near a special device to be read.  RIFD devices have also been implanted into animals for identification purposes and there is some use of RIFD devices being implanted in humans for the same reason.  That led a big eRumor several years ago about a chip made by Mondex and that it was going to be used by governments to track and control its citizens.  For more information about that, CLICK HERE.

"," The coin is real.  It is a new $1 George Washington coin.  Contrary to the eRumor, the coin does include “IN GOD WE TRUST” but it’s not on the front or the back of the coin.  It is engraved on the edge along with “E PLURIBUS UNUM.” The eRumor makes it sound as though the phrase “IN GOD WE TRUST” was left out of the design of the coin and asks the question of who was responsible. The design has always included “IN GOD WE TRUST” but it is possible that you might end up with one of the coins in your hand that does not have the engraved words on the edge.  That’s because when about 300 million of the coins were released on February 15, 2007, an unknown quantity were accidentally put into circulation without either “IN GOD WE TRUST” or “E PLURIBUS UNUM” on them.  They immediately became a hot item among coin collectors and on online auction sites.  Then in mid-March, the Associated Press reported that a Colorado couple found yet another flawed coin.  Mary and Ray Smith of Fort Collins heard about the “Godless” coins and bought two rolls of them, hoping to get one that did not have the engraving.  Instead, they found one that had the engraving, but not the front picture of George Washington or the back picture of the Statue of Liberty.  It could be worth thousands.

There are other allegations that say the senior vice president of the company, Toni Townes-Whitley was a classmate at Princeton with the future First Lady, Michelle Obama and  that CGI has donated millions of dollars to the Obama reelection campaign. "," There are various reports about CGI Federal, the company that developed the website for enrollment for the Affordable Healthcare Act, also known as Obamacare. Lets look at them one at a time: CGI Federal is a Canadian Company – Truth! CGI Federal is a U.S. subsidiary of CGI Group, which is headquartered in Montreal, Canada.  CGI Group has offices 40 countries around the world including 66 branches in the U.S.  This according to the company’s website . CGI Federal Senior Vice President Toni Townes-Whitley attended Princeton in 1985 with Michelle Obama- Reported to be True! “ First Lady Michelle Obama’s Princeton classmate is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the failed Obamacare website.”  This according to an October 25, 2013 article by that Daily Caller, which said, “Townes-Whitley and her Princeton classmate Michelle Obama are both members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni.” Townes-Whitley is Senior Vice-President of Civilian Agency Programs according to the CGI Group website. CGI Federal was the only company considered by the U.S. Government to design the health insurance exchange website- Disputed ! We found mixed reports on this one. According to an October 17, 2013 article by Reuters there were 31 bidders for the contract.  The article said “The work on Healthcare.gov grew out of a contract for open-ended technology services first issued in 2007 with a place-holder value of $1,000. There were 31 bidders. An extension, awarded in September 2011 specifically to build Healthcare.gov, drew four bidders, the documents show, including CGI Federal.” Another report said that CGI Federal got the order without going through the bid process.  This according to an October 13, 2013  article by the Washington Examiner .  The article said,  “CGI was one of 16 companies that had been qualified by HHS during President George W. Bush’s second term to deliver, without public competition, a variety of hardware, software and communication products and services.” On October 28, 2013 commentators on the Fox News network repeatedly said CGI got the order without bidding,  on both the Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity programs. CGI Federal was paid $678 million to build the enrollment website at Healthcare.gov- Fiction! The October 17, 2013 article by Reuters said, “As U.S. officials warned that the technology behind Obamacare might not be ready to launch on October 1, the administration was pouring tens of millions of dollars more than it had planned into the federal website meant to enroll Americans in the biggest new social program since the 1960s.”  At the time of this report the “potential total value” of the website is close to $292 million. CGI “donated” $47 Million to Obama’s campaign- Fiction! According to the Open Secrets site , “a research group tracking money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy,” CGI donated $128,000 to federal candidates and 52% of the recipients were  Republicans. We also found that CGI President George Schindler donated $1000 to the Obama reelection campaign, according to an October 17, 2013 article by the Daily Caller .   The article also said that Schindler donated $1000 for the election campaign for Mitt Romney, $1000 to Virginia Democratic Rep. Jim Moran in March 2011 and donated  $2,300 to the John McCain Presidential campaign.

"Christmas Tree Tax Begins in 2014-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/christmas-tree-tax/"," The federal government will levy a 15-cent tax on all Christmas trees sold in 2014. "," There are no plans to levy a federal tax on Christmas trees. The eRumor misrepresents a fee that will be collected through an industry-driven research and promotion program as a federal tax. Reports of the Christmas tree “tax” surfaced in 2011 when the USDA published a rule in the Federal Register. The rule was requested by the Christmas Tree Checkoff Task Force to establish a promotional program, which is also known as a checkoff. According to the rule: “The program will  be financed by an assessment on Christmas trees domestic producers  and importers and would be administered by a board of industry  members selected by the secretary of agriculture. The initial  assessment rate will be $0.15 per Christmas tree domestically  produced or imported into the United States and could be increased  up to $0.20 per Christmas tree. The purpose of the program will be  to strengthen the position of fresh cut Christmas trees in the  marketplace and maintain and expand markets for Christmas trees  within the United States.” However, the rule didn’t effect. In the wake of political backlash, a stay was placed on the rule a week after it was published in 2011 to give the USDA “time to reach out to the Christmas tree industry and the public to explain how a research and promotion program is a producer-driven program to support American farmers.” The stay was lifted in April 2014 by the Agriculture Reform, Food and Drugs Act of 2014 . That paved the way for the industry assessment to move forward. Producers of various commodities elect to participate in similar checkoff programs to help support marketing and research efforts. “These programs allow farmers, ranchers and other stakeholders to pool their funds and develop a coordinated program of research, promotion and consumer information to improve, maintain and develop markets for their products,” the USDA says. The National Christmas Tree Association (NCTA) said it first requested the checkoff program in 2009, and that as many as 70 percent of growers expressed support for it. “The program is designed to benefit the industry, especially small family farms, and will be funded by growers at a rate of 15 cents per tree sold,” the NCTA said. “The program will be administered by a 12-member board of industry representatives who will be responsible for developing and approving promotional research efforts to benefit the entire industry.” Those who produce or import more than 500 Christmas trees each year  will be subject to the 15-cent fee. It’s expected to generate $2  million a year, and a referendum vote will be held to gauge industry  support for its continuation in 2017. Posted 11/20/14 ","Government"
"Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad is Why Keystone Was Not Approved-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/burlington-rail-road/"," Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF), owned by President Obama-backer Warren Buffett, would lose billions of dollars in oil freight if the Keystone XL Pipeline were approved. "," This hoax has been circling the Internet in an email that went viral. The claim that BNSF owns all the railroad lines that connect the United States to western Canada is false. Canadian Pacific Railway operates some 14,000 miles of rail that extend from provinces in western Canada down through the Midwest. BNSF, meanwhile, operates 32,500 miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces, the company said on its website. The eRumor’s claim that BNSF transports 80 percent of the oil imported from Canada is mathematically impossible. Berkshire Hathaway, BNSF’s parent company, said in its 2013 annual report that BNSF transports about 500,000 barrels of oil per day. That accounts for about 10 percent of oil produced in the lower 48 states. The United States imports up to 2.2 million barrels of oil from Canada per day, according to an NPR report in April 2012. BNSF would have to transport 1.76 million barrels of oil per day to account for 80 percent Canadian imports, which is far beyond the company’s capacity. The eRumor’s claims about the cost of transporting oil by rail vs. pipeline also appear to be incorrect. According to an April 2014 New York Times report , it costs about $5 per barrel to transport oil via pipeline, and $10 to $15 to transport oil via rail. The claim that President Obama refuses to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline because Buffett stands to lose billions of dollars in oil freight is also false. Experts have said that a combination of rail and pipeline is needed to handle the volume of oil being transported in the United States. Neither system will have the capacity to transport all the oil. Buffet weighed in on the issue in an interview with the Minneapolis Star Tribune in Mach 2014. “I think the Keystone pipeline is probably a good idea for the country,” Buffett said. Buffet added that he wasn’t sure if it would be cheaper to transport millions of barrels of oil by pipeline or rail over the course of 100 years. The eRumor was correct on one point, however. Buffet has been a longtime supporter of Obama. Buffett has a well-documented history of making campaign contributions and hosting fundraisers, as ABC News reported in 2011 .

"Hillary Clinton’s Aide Has Family Ties To Muslim Brotherhood- Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/huma-abedin-muslim-brotherhood/"," Allegations spreading on the World Wide Web that Hillary Clinton’s aide and State Department Deputy Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin’s family has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.   The rumor alleges that Abedin’s mother and brother are both associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. "," We have not found any evidence of this being   true but we are continuing our investigation.  The State Department   was contacted but declined to comment. The source of the   rumor came from an article   written by Walid   Shoebat , who claims to be a former Palestinian   terrorist and a former  member of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Shobat   claimed that Abedin’s mother, Saleha Abedin,  belongs “to   the Brotherhood’s secret women’s division known as the Muslim Sisterhood   or what is known as the International Women’s Organization.”  The   article went on to say that her brother, Hassan, who is listed as a   fellow of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies , “partners with a number of Muslim Brotherhood members.”    Shoebat said that al-Qaeda associate, Omar Naseef and   Muslim Brotherhood leader Sheikh Youssef Qaradawi are listed   as Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies trustees. Shoebat was interviewed on the subject by Frontpage on June 24, 2011 , which resulted in a fury of opinions on   Internet blogs and calls for Abedin to step down. According to several   bios posted on the Internet, Huma Abedin was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan   and at the age of two moved with her family to Saudi Arabia.     She returned to the U.S. to study journalism and in 1996 began working   as an intern in the White House for Hillary Clinton and eventually worked for   her 2008 presidential campaign.   Abedin is the   wife of former Congressman Anthony Weiner who stepped down from office   in June 2011 after admitting to allegations of inappropriate behavior in   a “sexting” scandal. updated 6/29/11 ","Government"

"," This is a delicate one and could possibly be affected by which history book you read and how you interpret what is there.  The courageous patriots who signed the Declaration of Independence, as well as other of the fathers of our country, deserve all the recognition and honor we can give.  They risked everything to bring this country into being.  This email, however, makes it sound as though the British won, not the Colonists.  We don’t want to diminish the sacrifices each of them experienced.  There were hardships and losses, but to characterize the signers as not having enjoyed the fruits of their project of liberty is to overlook the quality of their abilities and the success of what they did. Here are some of our findings: First, none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence died in captivity.  All but two, or possibly three, died natural deaths and the majority of them lived to advanced age and had adequate possessions if not wealth.  Of the deaths, Thomas Lynch, Jr. was lost at sea on a recreational voyage, Button Gwinett died from injuries in a duel with a political rival, and George Wythe was thought to have been poisoned by a man who wanted his estate, but the man was acquitted.  At least four of the signers were captured by the British, but apparently because they were soldiers, not signers of the Declaration.  We consulted seven sources about the signers and none contained accounts of what could be called torture, at least not that was directed toward any of them for being founding fathers.  Two who were captured may have experienced some kind of torture because of the severity of their confinement, but that is conjecture.  All were released and died natural deaths, although the health of some was affected by their imprisonment.

"It’s against the law for Americans to have contact with space aliens-Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:58:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aliens/"," This message says that a law already passed by Congress makes it illegal to have contact with a space alien and establishes penalties for anybody who does. It specifies Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations. "," Several things to say about this story. First, the section of the Code of Federal Regulations that it is referring to is Title 14, Chapter V, Section 1211. Title 14 is the part of the code dealing with aviation and space and sections 1211 through 1299 specifically regulate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Section 1211 was added in 1969 when the U.S. would be bringing a space vehicle and astronauts back to earth from a mission to the moon. The section was designed to protect the earth from any contamination that may have been picked up during the trip and did not specifically describe contact with alien beings or UFO’s. The wording from Section 1211 part 100 says, ” NASA policy, responsibility and authority to guard the Earth against any harmful contamination or adverse changes in its environment resulting from personnel, spacecraft and other property returning to the [earth] after landing on or coming within the atmospheric envelope of a celestial body…” There is no mention of alien beings or vehicles. Section 1211 was taken out of the Code of Federal Regulations in 1991. An announcement in the 1991 code says that the section was removed “…since it has served its purpose and is no longer in keeping with current policy.” A complete reading of the regulation makes it clear that it applied to any manned or unmanned space mission that lands or comes within the “atmospheric envelope of a celestial body.” That would apply to anyone who has been into space, not all American citizens. It didn’t prohibit contact with extraterrestrials. It merely specified what regulations would affect a mission’s return to earth to protect us from space contamination. Also, although the government has denied that there have been known contacts with extraterrestrial beings or vehicles, there has never been, to our knowledge, a governmental position that there could not be. The NASA Origins Project, for example, includes the search for any life outside of our planet. According to NASA, the project is designed to explore two questions: Where do we come from and are we alone? ","Government"

General   Assembly in 2000.  He quotes a Millennium Project official as saying   that the U.S. would be forced to pay 0.7 percent of Gross National   Product in increased foreign aid spending.  That would be $65 billion a   year over what the U.S. currently spends in foreign aid and over a   13-year period from 2002 to 2015 when the U.S. is expected to reach the   Millennium Development Goals.  That adds up to $845 billion.

"List of Facts and Figures about Illegal Immigration-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-aliens/"," The eRumor claims to have a list of alarming facts about Illegal immigration. "," Illegal immigration is a significant issue for Americans and deserves attention, but whoever authored this eRumor did not help his or her cause.  Most of the figures are either difficult to prove or don’t match known facts.  Some seem to be fabricated. A couple actually proved their point even better than the statistics quoted. Some versions say the figures are from the Los Angeles Times (which is not true).  Others say they are statistics from the FBI (which is not true either). One of the challenges with this topic is that illegal immigrants are somewhat invisible to statistics.  They are living underground and the best figures about illegal immigrants are mostly based on deductions from those who are either in professional positions working with immigrant issues or doing research on immigration.  None of the estimates should be considered the last word on illegal immigration and the figures we found sometimes varied widely. Here is our research on each of the points of the email: 1. 40% of all workers in L.A. County (L.A. County has 10.2 million people) Fiction! Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles issued a report in 2005 on what it called “L.A’s Off-The-Books labor force.”  Its research was about the city of Los Angeles, not the entire county, and concluded that there were 3,908,000 wage earners in the city and about 972,000 “informal workers,” meaning they were getting paid under the table.  It does not break down how many of them might have been illegal aliens, but the percentage was no where near 40 percent.  Los Angeles Almanac estimated number of “unreported jobs” in 2005 in Los Angeles County at 643,000 with a number of workers at 4,090.630. 2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens- Mostly Truth! The most commonly quoted source for this is a report by Heather McDonald and published by the Center for Immigration Studies.  She repeated her research on April 13, 2005 in testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on “Immigration, Border Security, and Claims” saying that 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide in Los Angeles targeted illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens- Unproven! We could not find anything to substantiate this.  If you browse through the Most Wanted list for the Los Angeles Police Department there are a lot of foreign-born listed, but not how many of them may be illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers- Inaccurate! According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, about half the births in Los Angeles County in 2004 were to undocumented women.  In 1989 California required by law that the state  Medi-Cal program be available to pregnant women living in poverty. 5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally- Fiction! National statistics would tend to suggest that this claim is not true.  A 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center said that among men 18-39, which represents the majority of prison inmates, the incarceration rate of foreign born was 0.7 percent while the incarceration rate of native born was 3.5 percent.   Foreign born Mexicans had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent in 2000 compared with 5.9 percent for native born men of Mexican descent.  The report did not say how many of the foreign born were illegal.  A 1993 report to the California Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations estimated that more than 15 percent of the 116,000 state prison inmates were illegal aliens.  In her congressional testimony (referenced above), Heather McDonald said that the L.A. County Sheriff reported in 2000 that 23% of inmates in county jails were deportable, according to the New York Times.  That’s all inmates, however, not just Mexicans. 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages- Unproven! It is known that large numbers of illegal immigrants are crammed into houses and apartments that are too small for the number of people living in them and that others are living in garages, but we could not find anyone who kept statistics on garage-dwellers or how anybody would know their numbers. 7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border- Unproven! It is known that gangs do include illegal aliens but coming up with a reliable statistic would be difficult.  Again, the gangs operate underground. 8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal- Unproven! 9. 21 radio stations in L.A. are Spanish speaking- Mostly Truth! As the Spanish-speaking population of Los Angeles has grown so has the presence of Spanish-speaking media.  We counted about 18 stations in Los Angeles that are either Spanish or are multi-cultural and include Spanish in their music or programming.  At this writing, four of the top ten stations in Los Angeles are Spanish and the number-one station is usually Spanish. 10. In L.A. County 5.1 million people speak English. 3.9 million speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people in L.A. County )- Inaccurate But the Real Figures Support the Point! The U.S.Census Bureau reported that as of 2004, 3.9 million people in L.A.County spoke only English at home; 3.7 million spoke primarily Spanish at home. 11. Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare- Fiction! The U.S. department of Labor said that the number of farm workers who were undocumented in 1998-1998 was 52% . Regarding welfare, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for welfare except for elementary and high school education and emergency medical care.  Children born in the U.S. are citizens and qualify for certain public assistance. But what is generally thought of as welfare is available only to citizens or legal immigrants. 12. Over 70% of the United States annual population growth (and over 90% of California , Florida , and New York) is illegal aliens- Fiction! The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that the number of illegal aliens increased in 2000 by 408,000 while the general population increased by 32,712,033.

A Facebook post that appeared on social media includes a photo of dozens of men hanging from a gallow with a caption that begins: “This picture is of 39 men that were ordered to be executed by Abraham Lincoln for treaty violations (hunting off of their assigned reservation). Yes the ‘Great Emancipator’ as the history books so fondly referred to him as.” It’s true that 38 (not 39) Dakota men were executed on December 26, 1862, in America’s largest mass execution ever. But the eRumor’s first false claim is that the men were executed for things like “hunting off of their assigned reservation.” The truth is that the Dakota men were hanged after a bloody conflict with white settlers. The Dakota were frustrated with late annuity payments for land, with corrupt traders and government officials, and with not having a way for their complaints to be heard, according to records kept by the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Then, in August of 1862, it boiled over when four young Dakota men killed five white people, including a 14-year-old girl. The Dakota men got into an argument about stealing chicken eggs from a white farmer, and the killings were to prove to each other that they weren’t afraid of white men, Big Eagle, a member of the Dakota at the time, later recalled . That led to a bloody conflict between the Dakota and the white settlers of Minnesota over the next couple months. There were as many as 600 white people killed and hundreds more Dakota. More than a thousand Dakota were taken prisoner and Colonel Henry Sibley — who had been appointed by Minnesota’s governor to handle the conflict — set up a military commission to try the prisoners for “murders and outrages” committed against Americans, according to historical accounts of the trials: “The trials were elaborately conducted until the commission became acquainted with the details of the different outrages and battles, and then, the only point being the connection of the prisoner with them, five minutes would dispose of a case. “If witnesses testified, or the prisoner admitted, that he was a participant, sufficient was established. As many as 40 were sometimes tried in a day. Those convicted of plundering were condemned to imprisonment; those engaged in individual massacres and in battles, to death.” The commission had sentenced 307 Dakota to death by the end of the trials. A list of Dakota men who were to be executed was sent to Abraham Lincoln for approval. And, this is the second time that the eRumor jumps the rails. Lincoln’s action to pardon most of the men infuriated Minnesotans and has been viewed by many as an example of Lincoln’s “Solomon-like wisdom,” according to the Johns Hopkins University Press : “Lincoln willfully ordered this mass hanging in order to appease a Minnesota settler populace threatening riots and anarchy, perhaps even secession, if he did not do as they demanded. “During the war trials that followed the 1862 conflict, President Lincoln was made aware of the conditions on the Dakota reservations, particularly at Lower Sioux, in addition to Minnesotans’ clarion call for the Dakotas’ extermination. With this in mind, the process through which Lincoln decided to reduce the number of condemned from three hundred and three to thirty-nine (with the thirty-ninth acquitted at the last moment) is seen by some as another example of this president’s Solomon-like wisdom. In other words, Lincoln is credited with having drawn a difficult compromise between a vengeful populace and a defeated Indian nation reduced to being prisoners of war. Even Dakota writer and activist Charles Alexander Eastman, whose father and uncles fought against the United States in 1862, expressed his gratitude for Lincoln’s magnanimity, when he stated in his 1915 book ‘The Indian To-Day’ that a ‘new Indian policy’ emerged when Lincoln refused ‘to order the execution of three hundred Sioux braves, whom a military court had, in less than two days, convicted of murder and condemned to be hung, in order to satisfy the clamor of the citizens of Minnesota.’” It’s true that actions taken by Congress forced the Dakota from Minnesota after the executions were carried out on December 26, 1862 — but it’s not fair to place all the blame for that on Lincoln, the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council reports : “The original Dakota Community was established by treaty in 1851. The treaty set aside a 10-mile wide strip of land on both sides of the Minnesota River as the permanent home of the Dakota. However, in the aftermath of the U.S.-Dakota Conflict of 1862, Congress abrogated all treaties made with them and the Dakota were forced from their homes in the state. The four communities were reestablished in their current localities by acts of Congress in 1886. The four Dakota Communities today represent small segments of the original reservation that were restored to the Dakota by Acts of Congress or Proclamations of the Secretary of Interior.” Lastly, the photo of men hanging from a gallows that appears with the eRumor is likely not a photo of the actual Dakota execution. The photo doesn’t exist in the Minnesota Historical Society’s archive , and the men in the photo are dressed like Europeans, not Dakota. It’s highly unlikely that Minnesotans would have given Dakota men new pants, vests and coats before their execution. In the end, a lot of factors led to the Dakota conflict and the fallout that followed it. Arguments can be made that the Dakota were treated unfairly, but its wrong to pin all the blame for the mass execution on Lincoln, as this eRumor attempts to do. ","Government"
"The Slavery Tax Refund-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/slaverytaxrefund/"," The story is that the U.S. government has passed a bill to make things right with all descendants of slaves through a refund called the “Black Inheritance Tax Refund/40 Acres and a Mule.”  A telephone number is given, which, if you call, you’ll receive a packet of information on how to receive the refund.  The eRumor also says this was passed under President Bill Clinton, but the government does not want you to be educated about your rights, so there hasn’t been much publicity about it. "," This rumor has been making the rounds of       the African American community for quite some time, but there is no       current  truth to it.  It is the attempt to apply an order       that was given by a Union general during the Civil War that some       freed slaves were given 40 acres and a mule, but no longer has       validity. The Internal Revenue Service says scam artists have seized on the       eRumor and have been charging people for arranging for them to get       their refund.  The IRS has discovered that it mistakenly paid       more than $30 million to tax payers who claimed the non-existent       slavery tax credits in 2000 and 20001.  According to the IRS,       more than 77,000 tax returns were received in 2001 that included the       slavery tax credit that, if paid, would have added up to $2.7       billion.  Most of them were based on a figure of $43,000 that       Essence magazine suggested was the 1993 value of 40 acres and a       mule.

"Police Officer in Prison Because Her Police Dog Bit a RobberySuspect-Truth!","2015-03-17 16:36:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stephanie-mohr/"," The forwarded email is an appeal for financial assistance from a former Maryland Police officer who is in prison for what she says is a wrongful conviction of her police dog biting a robbery suspect in 1995. "," This mailer is from officer Stephanie Mohr who is in prison and appealing a conviction that resulted from an incident with her police dog on 9/21/95. According to court records, an officer was doing surveillance in an area of Prince George’s County where burglaries had been taking place. When he spotted two men on top of a building, he radioed for help and someone, in turn, asked for a K-9 (dog) unit.  Officers Stephanie Mohr and Anthony Delozier, along with a Maryland State Police helicopter, all showed up at the scene. The two suspects were arrested and charged with burglary.  The charges were later dismissed against one of them.  The other pleaded guilty. In 2000, the suspect whose charges had been dismissed brought action against Mohr and her partner with violating the law by “acting under color of law to willfully deprive him of his right to be free from the use of unreasonable force.”  Both were also charged with conspiracy.  In the trial Officer Mohr said that one of the suspects did not raise his hands as ordered and did not follow her orders to stop when he came down from the roof.  She says that his body motions indicated to her that he was beginning to flee in a direction where there were no officers.  She says she told him to stop then released the dog to handle it.  The result was that the suspect was bitten by the dog.  Prosecution witnesses said they remembered it differently.  The officer who originally requested the assistance, Sgt. Dennis Bonn, among others, testified that the two suspects came from the roof peacefully, with their hands in the air, and did as they were told.  He says the dog was released on the suspects as they stood cooperatively with their hands up. The jury dropped the conspiracy charge against Mohr and the violation of rights charge against her partner but could not agree on the violation of rights charge against Mohr or the conspiracy charge against her partner.  A mistrial was declared.  The second trial convicted Mohr of the violation of rights charge and cleared her partner of the conspiracy charge.  She was sentenced to 120 months in prison. Officer Mohr says she’s been the target of zealous prosecutors who are looking for cases of civil rights violations against minorities and that some testimony against her has been stacked against her.  Critics of Mohr say she was part of a pattern of officers whose dogs had bitten cooperative suspects. TruthOrFiction.com has confirmed with the Prince George County Police Department in Maryland that the solicitation for funds is legitimately from the Law Enforcement Officer’s Legal Defense Fund.

"The IRS is going to require guns to be listed on income tax forms-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sb2099/"," This story is that Congress is considering legislation that will require all firearms that a person owns be listed on that person’s personal income tax return.  Additionally, it may require fingerprints and tax of $50 per gun.  This is said to be in SB2099, a bill in the United States Senate. "," This was either a misreading of the actual bill or an intentional misrepresentation of it. SB2099 was known as the “Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000.”  Some versions of the eRumor have changed the dated to 2009 but that was added by someone along the way.  The bill died in a Senate committee and was never passed into law. TruthOrFiction.com  reviewed some of the history and the text of the bill as well as a portion of the IRS code it sought to amend. The bill would amended the National Firearms Act (NFA) to require registration of handguns in the same way as machine guns and short-barrel weapons.  That process have would include photographs, background checks, fingerprinting, and restrictions on interstate transport.  It would have also required a $5 tax for transferring ownership and a $50 tax per gun on gunmakers. Nothing in the law required gun owners to list their guns on their income tax returns.  That confusion may have come from the fact that the law refered to the Internal Revenue Service, but only because the act it sought to amend, the NFA, was a part of the Internal Revenue Service Code. Also, there was language in the bill that refered to “return” information, but that wasn’t about personal income taxes.  It was about a database of gun registration information which this bill would have sought to allow law enforcement agencies to access online. updated 08/07/09 ","Government"

"," Go get a cup of coffee to drink while reading this, because this one is confusing. First, don’t worry about the July 1 deadline.  It actually referred to July 1, 2001, and it wasn’t a deadline for you.  It was a deadline for certain financial institutions to notify you of “opt-out” policies (explained below).  You haven’t missed out on anything. Second, most version of this eRumor say that if you don’t respond, anybody who asks will be given your personal information including your Social Security number.  That is not true. Here are the details. As you have discovered, it is common for people with whom you have done business to put you on their mailing lists and for them to send you information from time to time about themselves.  They’re looking for additional business from you. It is also true that many of those companies will make your name, address, and other information about you available to other companies so those companies can send you information about themselves, their products, and their services.  Sometimes that information is sold to other companies.  Sometimes it is shared among companies that have the same ownership or other alliances. A lot of people objected to this company-to-company sharing of personal  information so in response, Congress passed The Financial Services Modernization Act, also known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB).  It required financial institutions such as banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, or brokerage firms to notify their customers by July 1, 2001 of their policies regarding what is done with information about them…and to give the chance to “opt out” of the process.  In other words, to to give you the chance to tell those institutions that you do not want your information shared or sold to anyone else.  It did not mean that if you failed to respond by July 1 you were out of luck.  You can request privacy information at any time from any company and ask about whether you can opt-out and, if so, how. In a completely separate and previous action in 1996, Congress also passed an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  This one applied to credit bureaus, those companies that keep track of your credit information.  The amendment required them to give customers an opportunity to “opt-out” if they didn’t want their information shared with other companies who may want to solicit them for business.  That’s where the telephone number came from and it is authentic.  If you dial (888) 567-8688, that will accomplish your opt-out request with the top four major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, Trans-union, and Innovis. To make things more confusing, if you call the number, there is a recording that explains that some of the information in the eRumors is incorrect and some people have thought that means the number is bogus. We do urge caution.  Before you call any of the telephone numbers in an email, make sure they are correct. (See the links below).  You will be asked to share personal information such as your Social Security number and you don’t want to give it to anyone who many have inserted a bogus phone number into the email.

"Ted Kennedy Sent a Secret Letter to the Soviets in 1983-Truth!","2015-03-13 02:27:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ted-kennedy-sent-a-secret-letter-to-the-soviets-in-1983/"," Ted Kennedy asked leaders of the Soviet Union to help the Democrats defeat President Reagan in the 1984 presidential election in a secret letter that he sent in 1983. "," This eRumor is true. Sen. Ted Kennedy wrote the letter to Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov in 1983. In the letter, Kennedy reportedly talked about his concerns with U.S.-Soviet relations, and about President Reagan’s plan to deploy middle range nuclear weapons to Western Europe. Ted Kennedy’s original letter to Soviet leaders hasn’t turned up. But Kennedy’s letter was discussed in a memo from KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov to Yuri Andropov that turned up in 1992. According to the memo : “The only real threats to Reagan are problems of war and peace and Soviet-American relations. These issues, according to the senator, will without a doubt become the most important of the election campaign. The movement advocating a freeze on nuclear arsenals of both countries continues to gain strength in the United States. The movement is also willing to accept preparations, particularly from Kennedy, for its continued growth. In political and influential circles of the country, including within Congress, the resistance to growing military expenditures is gaining strength. “However, according to Kennedy, the opposition to Reagan is still very weak. Reagan’s adversaries are divided and the presentations they make are not fully effective. Meanwhile, Reagan has the capabilities to effectively counter any propaganda.” The memo goes on to discuss Ted Kennedy’s request for Yuri Andropov to invite him to Moscow for a meeting. Kennedy reportedly said that he could provide “explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the U.S.A.” Kennedy said he had similar meetings planned with British and French leaders. Ted Kennedy also requested that Yuri Andropov do a number of interviews on American television, according to the memo : “A direct appeal by the General Secretary to the American people will, without a doubt, attract a great deal of attention and interest in the country. The senator is convinced this would receive the maximum resonance in so far as television is the most effective method of mass media and information.” Kennedy also reportedly said he was “very impressed” with the Soviet’s commitment to “heal international affairs, and improve mutual understandings between people.” Historian Paul Kengor wrote about the memo in his book, “The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism.” Kengor explained in a 2008 interview how the document had been discovered: “It comes from the Central Committee archives of the former USSR. Once Boris Yeltsin took over Russia in 1991, he immediately began opening the Soviet archives, which led to a rush on the archives by Western researchers. One of them, Tim Sebastian of the London Times and BBC, found the Kennedy document and reported it in the February 2, 1992 edition of the Times, in an article titled, ‘Teddy, the KGB and the top secret file.’ “But this electrifying revelation stopped there; it went no further. Never made it across the Atlantic. Not a single American news organization, from what I can tell, picked up the story. Apparently, it just wasn’t interesting enough, nor newsworthy. Reports of the Ted Kennedy-KGB memo went viral after a group of Republican senators sent an open letter to leaders of Iran about ongoing nuclear negotiations. This sparked a debate about senators undermining presidents and brought new attention to the Kennedy memo. ","Government"
