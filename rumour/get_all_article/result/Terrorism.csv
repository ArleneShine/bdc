"Yavex USA Sent Ammo to Terrorists in Shipping Containers-Mostly Fiction!","2016-10-10 11:18:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/yavex-usa-ammunition-headed-terrorists-europe/"," Greek border agents found guns and ammo made by Yavex USA headed to terrorists in shipping containers full of furniture. "," Claims that Greek customs officials found guns and Yavex ammunition headed to regions controlled by terrorists are mostly false This is actually a new twist on old rumor. In September 2015, Greek officials found guns and ammo inside a shipping container that was disguised to look like lawn furniture. Although it was rumored that the arms were headed to Syrian refugee camps in Europe, it was actually bound from Turkey to Libya, Reuters UK reports : Greek authorities have seized a freighter carrying an undeclared shipment of weapons en route from Turkey to Libya, coast guard officials said on Wednesday. A coast guard patrol boat raided the vessel on Tuesday, 20 nautical miles northeast of Crete. The freighter, with a crew of seven and which had sailed from the Turkish port of Iskenderun, was escorted to Heraklion port on the island. The United Nations has imposed an embargo on weapons shipments to Libya, which is plagued by factional conflict. “The ship’s crew is being questioned and the content of its containers will be checked,” a coast guard official said, declining to be named. The coast guard provided no further details of what kind of arms the freighter had on board, or its ownership. A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the cargo included weapons but said it was fully documented and was destined for the Sudanese police force. The vessel was also carrying building materials for Libya, he said. In September 2016, the story was re-reported as breaking news. This time, photos showed boxes of “Yavex” brand ammunition, which led internet sleuths to claim that it was being supplied by Yavex USA, an American company based in Florida, to terrorist cells or refugees. First, we can confirm that boxes of Yavex ammunition were indeed found in the shipping containers in 2015. Photos and videos of the shipping containers, like this one published by the Independent , clearly show boxes of Yavex ammo: However, theories that Yavex USA shipped the arms to terrorists, proving that radical Muslims are infiltrating America, don’t check out. Turkish company Yavascalar A.S. makes Yavex ammunition, the company’s website reports : YAVASCALAR AS, based in Balikesir / Turkey and specializes in the manufacture and marketing of civil explosives, initiating systems and hunting munitions. Founded in 1940, Yavascalar ranks today as a leader in the field of explosives in Turkey and in the countries of the region. And Yavex USA is just a distribution division of Yavascalar AS, according to “ Shot Show ,” an online resource for gun shows and exhibitors: YAVEX USA is a US Distribution division of Yavascalar AS of Turkey. Yavascalar is a well known Turkish manufacturer of high quality pistol ammunition and shotshell loads. Currently product line includes 9mm Luger pistol ammunition and related components but in year 2016 company is planning to produce all pistol calibers and rifle calibers as well. Yavex USA servers all dealers form Fort Myers, FL USA warehouse location since 2013 directly. Besides that, it’s not clear exactly who sent the shipping containers full of arms, but it’s highly unlikely that it came directly from Yavascalar AS. In reality, anybody could have put the company’s ammunition into the shipping containers. And, even though it’s not clear exactly who was behind the shipment, the Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed the contents and destination of the containers, indicating that it could have been behind the shipment.

"Shooter Arcan Cetin Illegally Voted 3 Times-Mostly Fiction!","2016-09-30 08:39:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/shooter-arcan-cetin-voted-3-times-despite-lack-of-green-card/"," Arcan Cetin, the man accused of a mass shooting at Cascade Mall in Washington State on September 23rd, is a registered voter who participated in three elections even though he isn’t a naturalized citizen. "," It’s true that Arcan Cetin has voted in three state elections since 2014 — but he is a naturalized U.S. citizen who had the right to do so. Cetin, a Turkish native, was charged with five counts of murder in connection to a mass shooting at Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, on September 23rd. Almost immediately, speculation began to stir about Cetin’s political affiliations, citizenship and voting record. In the days that followed the shooting, state and federal authorities described Cetin as a “permanent U.S. resident” — not a naturalized U.S. citizen with voting rights. The National Review seized on those early reports to argue that non-citizens frequently vote for Democratic candidates: Arcan Cetin faces five counts of murder after his shooting rampage at a Seattle-area mall last week. But he also turns out to be a non-citizen who has voted three times in state elections since 2014. Liberals claim non-citizen voting fraud is extremely rare, but Cetin’s case should cast light on both just how easy it is to commit and the efforts of federal and state officials to block efforts to uncover it. Cetin, who is from Turkey, is a legal resident of the United States but not a citizen. In 2014, he registered to vote and voted three times, most recently in May’s presidential primary. Washington State, like all but a handful of states, doesn’t require any proof of citizenship. “Our hands are kind of tied,” Secretary of State Kim Wyman told a Seattle TV station, noting that the state doesn’t allow verification of a person’s citizenship for voting purposes. “But make no mistake,” she adds. “We want to make sure that everybody has confidence that people casting ballots are eligible. This is certainly going to be a topic at the next legislative session.” Local registrars can currently use a database to check the age and residence of people who register to vote, but a person’s claim to be a citizen is based on the honor system. However, NBC Washington affiliate KING 5-TV, the outlet that first reported that Cetin had voted illegally, updated its initial report with a correction that stated Cetin was indeed a naturalized citizen who legally voted: UPDATE: KING 5 learned Thursday that Arcan Cetin, the 20-year-old who killed five people at Cascade Mall on Sept. 23, is in fact a U.S. citizen. For days after the shooting, Cetin was described by local and federal law enforcement as being a permanent U.S. resident. He immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey when he was a child, after his mother married an American citizen. On Thursday, a federal official told KING that further investigation revealed that Cetin is a naturalized U.S. citizen. That means he was legally registered to vote. And, while it’s clear that Cetin praised an ISIS leader in a blog post , but his political affiliations aren’t clear at this point. Some have pointed to a 2015 tweet as proof that Cetin supports Hillary Clinton: However, Cetin appears to have been referring to the NFL Conference Championship game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks that was held on the same day, January 18, 2015, that Cetin tweeted. In saying that if “we win” he would vote for Hillary Clinton, Cetin appears to imply that he wouldn’t vote for Clinton under normal circumstances. So, it’s true the Cetin voted in three state elections in Washington since 2014, but he was a naturalized U.S. citizen who was legally allowed to do so. And claims that Cetin supports Hillary Clinton don’t check out since his tweet from January 2015 seems to state the opposite. ","Terrorism"

"Hillary Clinton VP Pick Tim Kaine’s Ties to Radical Islam-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-07-25 15:28:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-vp-pick-tim-kaine-ties-radical-islam/"," Claims about Tim Kaine having longstanding ties to radical Islam went viral after Hillary Clinton named the Virginia senator as her running mate. "," Claims about Tim Kaine’s connections to radical Islam are true, false and misleading. Those rumors started with a report by Breitbart that appeared under the headline, “Clinton VP Pick Tim Kaine’s Islamist Ties” that makes three specific claims about Kaine. We took a look at all three claims: Tim Kaine Appointed Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Suspect to State Immigration Commission- Truth! & Fiction! Tim Kaine appointed Dr. Esam Omeish to serve on the Virginia Commission on Immigration while Kaine served as the state’s governor in 2007. Omeish resigned a month later after a video from a political rally in 2000 surfaced that showed him calling for support of the “jihad way.” Another video showed Omeish call for a crowd gathered for at a Jerusalem Day rally in December 2000 to stand with Muslims fighting in the Middle East. In the video, Omeish says, After requesting Omeish’s resignation, Kaine said in a statement that, “Dr. Omeish is a respected physician and community leader, yet I have been made aware of certain statements he has made which concern me. Dr. Omeish indicated he did not want this controversy to distract from the important work of the commission.” The American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) said in a statement that it was “unfortunate” that Kaine did not thoroughly vet Omeish prior to his appointment to the commission: Many of Dr. Omeishﾒs statements and activities in the past have in fact been a manifestation of political Islam and his attempt to use the Muslim community as a tool in a specific Islamist political agenda. This not only violates the core principles of the separation of religion and politics, which is a cornerstone of our nation, but is in fact the main mechanism of influence of transnational Islamism. His public advocacy of  jihad in the Middle East by co-religionists implicitly via terrorist organizations like Hezbullah or HAMAS against Israel, an ally of the United States, should certainly highlight the toxicity of Islamism as a political ideology — regardless of the ideological jujitsu one uses to define ‘jihad’. For his part, Omeish denied that he had advocated for violence, saying, “In Islam, jihad is a broad word that means constant struggle — struggling spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, physically — in all respects. So my words were in support of people who are resisting occupation and people who are trying to . . . remove oppression from their land.” So, while it’s true that Omeish resigned from the immigration commission after videos came to light of him making controversial comments about jihad, the claim that Omeish himself was suspected of terrorism is false. That claim appears to stem from his involvement with the Muslim American Society (MAS) — and allegations that the group has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Omeish served as president of multiple regional chapters of MAS, and he also served on its national board of trustees, according to his website . However, MAS denies any current ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The group, which was founded in 1993, acknowledges that the Muslim Brotherhood (or Ikhawan) played an influential part in post-colonial Muslim history, and, as a result, literature written by Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been used to form the foundation of MAS: The Ikhwan are an influential part of post-colonial Muslim history, and have given rise to many prominent Muslim thinkers. This naturally resulted in the literature of those Islamic movements becoming the foundational texts for the intellectual component for Islamic work in America. We believe this had the advantage of protecting the majority of Muslims from extremist ideologies. With Muslims establishing themselves more and more as an integral part of American society, there was a need for an ongoing effort to re-evaluate the literature. This resulted in a re-examination of various authors and their contributions to the legacy. The outcome was the realization that the majority of what was written by Hassan al-Banna can be categorized as foundational thought (e.g. balanced understanding of Islam, societal reform, peaceful change, etc.) while a part of what he wrote may have been applicable to his time and place, but not to Muslims in America. MAS is not listed as a terrorist organization by the State Department. Beside that, we could not find any official documents to support the claim that Omeish was suspected of terrorism. Tim Kaine Spoke At Dinner Honoring Muslim Brotherhood Terror Suspect- Truth! & Misleading! While running for the Senate in 2011, Tim Kaine spoke before the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) during a “Candidate Night” dinner hosted by the organization. Kaine was among “46 Democratic and Republican politicans making their pitch for election or reelection to state offices” during the dinner, IIIT reported in a 2011 press release about the dinner. And, as the former governor of Virginia, Kaine was invited to speak at the dinner. At the Candidate Night dinner, Dr. Jamal Barzingi, a man who was reportedly instrumental in establishing the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence in the United States, was honored with IIIT’s lifetime achievement award, according to the press release. Barzingi’s obituary (he died in 2015) reports that he was the president of the Muslim Students Association (MSA) in “its early days.” During that time, the Washington Post reported in 2004 , Bazingi shaped the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence in Egyptian elections: The life story of one of the IIIT network’s leaders illustrates the key role it has played in the global politics of the Ikhwan. Jamal M. Barzinji fled his native Iraq in 1969 when the Baathist regime started executing fellow Islamists. An engineering student and top MSA leader, he joined MSA associates in 1971 to host the top leaders of the Egyptian Brotherhood, just released from 16 years in prison, for two weeks of meetings in Indiana. He and other then-MSA leaders helped persuade the Egyptian brothers to try participating in Egyptian elections as an alternative to underground struggle , he said. “It was one of our main contributions to the Ikhwan movement worldwide,” he said. He and his associates likewise have hosted many other Islamist leaders here over the years to “show them how wrong they are in being anti-American,” Barzinji said. But again, there’s no indication that Barzinji was suspected of terrorism. In fact, Barzinji actively worked with Republican strategist and thought leader Grover Norquist to help Republicans win over Muslim voters. Norquist later said the Muslim vote won the presidency for George W. Bush in 2000. And Kaine’s appearance at the IIIT Candidate Night dinner has been mischaracterized. Kaine and nearly 50 other politicians from Virginia were in attendance that night to court support for their campaigns, which isn’t out of the ordinary. Tim Kaine Accepted Islamist Financial Support- Truth! & Fiction ! Claims that Tim Kaine accepted funding from an Islamist are a mixed bag of truth and fiction. The Breitbart article correctly states that Barzingi’s group, IITC, donated $10,000 to New Dominion PAC in 2011 — and that New Dominion PAC donated $43,050 to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign from 2003-2005. So, clearly, Kaine received contributions from New Dominion PAC more than six years before IITC donated $10,000 to the PAC. That connection between IITC and Kaine’s political career doesn’t check out. Kaine did receive $7,800 from American Islamic organizations from 2011-2012, according to the Islamist Money in Politics database . But that’s not very unusual. Candidates from both parties are listed as having received donations from Islamic groups (even though Democrats usually receive more), so it doesn’t prove much. In conclusion, claims about Tim Kaine’s “longstanding ties” to radical Islam are a mixed bag of truth and fiction. It seems, however, that tidbits of truth have often been manipulated and misconstrued to support the larger narrative that Kaine has radical Islamic ties. ","Terrorism"

The story surfaced with a report at the Christian Times Newspaper under the headline, “BREAKING: Feds Cancel ALL July 4th Fireworks Due to Terror Fears.” The report begins: Thursday that Fourth of July fireworks shows across the U.S. will be canceled for safety and security reasons. Representatives from the FBI, DOD, and Department of Homeland Security held a joint press conference in Washington to announce the unprecedented policy move. “Ongoing threats to American national security from ISIS, domestic terrorists, and foreign terrorist organizations led federal authorities to determine that a cancellation of July 4th fireworks is necessary to reduce potential attack scenarios,” said Terrance Lively, a counter-terrorism expert with the DHS. However, a quick glance at the Christian Times Newspaper’s disclaimer reveals that it’s not a reputable source for news. It states that the site makes clear that “not all stories are necessarily grounded in fact.” Given the fake news website’s resemblance in name and branding to the reputable Christian Times , there’s often confusion about the credibility of the website.

But who knows? The article is based purely on speculation about Seddique Mateen’s Facebook posts, and it even concludes with the catchall disclaimer, “but who knows?” The article uses screen grabs of photos that Seddique Mateen posted of himself posing outside of a door marked “State Department” and “Committee on Foreign Affairs.” That’s flimsy proof that he held meetings with high-ranking officials. Seddique Mateen also posted pictures of himself with Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel and Republican U.S. Rep. Ed Royce ( who chairs the Committee on Foreign Affairs ). Royce said in a statement that he had a “brief, inconsequential” meeting with Seddique Mateen: “About a year and a half ago, we had a brief and inconsequential meeting. I routinely meet with Afghan-Americans, and I vaguely recall a discussion about the issue of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.” A spokesperson for Rangel, meanwhile, said the congressman was stopped in the hallway by Seddique and was asked for a photo — but the two men never had a meeting.

"," Laila Alawa served on the DHS Advisory Council’s Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Subcommittee — but this isn’t a new development and she wasn’t included in a final report released  by the subcommittee in June. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson ordered the Homeland Security Advisory Council to establish the Countering Violent Extremism Subcommittee in November 2015. The goal was for the subcommittee to serve as “an incubator of ideas” and to develop recommendations to help DHS support non-governmental organizations directly or indirectly work to counter violent extremism. Laila Alawa was listed as a member of the subcommittee on the DHS website — and an article published by conservative pundit Tucker Carlson’s The Daily Caller under the headline, “Syrian Immigrant Who Said 9/11 ‘Changed the World for Good’ Is a Homeland Security Adviser.” The report takes issue with this 2014 tweet from Laila Alawa about 9/11: The Political Insider picked up the story under the headline, “Just After Orlando, Obama Hires Muslim Who Praised 9/11 FOR THIS JOB.” That story falsely made it appear that President Obama had “just” hired Laila Alawa for a DHS post and fueled outrage among conservative and right wing blog sites. Even though Laila Alawa was listed as a member of the subcommittee on the DHS website, her name does not appear anywhere in an i nterim report that was released by the subcommittee in June. Alawa, the CEO and founder of The Tempest , a media company that caters to young women, responded to her critics, and claims that she had “just” been hired in a blog post . Of her work on the subcommittee and its interim report, Alawa wrote: The report, focused on creating “just add water” solutions to counter extremists of all backgrounds and ideologies, went out this week, following the horrific Orlando tragedy and amidst the murky political election season we all know too well. We were working to “leverage outside expertise and new thinking to support and enhance, as well as assist in reframing and re-envisioning, where necessary the Department’s CVE efforts.” I worked to ensure that the future of America’s CVE programming focused on creating inclusive solutions that promoted a national sense of community and belonging, rather than isolation and alienation. The problem is – I wasn’t included on the final report. I was just noted on the DHS website, and that’s when things got horrific. And in response to the tweet about 9/11, Alawa wrote: Just like every American, 9/11 was a tragedy that hit close to home. I was 10 when it happened, living in upstate New York, and the event and ensuing aftermath left me – and the nation – reeling. So much so that it changed my career path for good – I now fight to ensure that every woman, no matter who or where or how she is, has a media outlet to find a space in. So in 2014, upon the anniversary of the attacks, I sent out a tweet, like I do every year, about the events that had transpired. To put it in third grade terms, since everyone is pretending not to understand given what I wear on my head, believe as my faith, and identify as my heritage: The tragedies of 9/11 changed the world as we know it permanently. It’s up to us to make the world a more united place by having conversations, no matter our differences. So, it’s true that Laila Alawa was once appointed to serve on the Homeland Security Advisory Council’s Countering Violent Extremism Subcommittee — but claims that she was “just” hired or that it was in response to the Orlando terrorist attack are false. And it’s also true that Alawa tweeted about 9/11, but she has argued that her statements were misinterpreted and taken out of context. Given all that, we’re calling this one truth and fiction.

"The Math Doesn’t Add Up in the Orlando Nightclub Shooting-Fiction!","2016-06-17 07:44:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/math-doesnt-add-orlando-nightclub-shooting/"," A post claiming that the “math” of the terrorist attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that left 50 people dead doesn’t add up has gone viral on social media. "," This post detailing “a short math problem” about the Orlando nightclub shooting uses incorrect information and an incorrect version of events to arrive at that conclusion. The post began circulating Facebook shortly after Omar Mateen went on a rampage at the Pulse in Orlando that left 50 people and many more injured. It’s not clear where it started or who the original author was, but a screen grab of it posted at The Free Patriot has been widely circulated. First, it argues that there’s no way a lone shooter could have fired 1,000 rounds of .223 ammunition from an AR-15 and reload 30 times in under seven minutes. However, Omar Mateen didn’t use an AR-15 in the shooting, and he didn’t fire 1,000 rounds. He used a Sig Sauer MCX rifle that he purchased on June 4, and a Glock 17 handgun that he purchased on June 5, according to Orlando Police. The Sig Sauer MCX has an “effective rate of fire” of 150-200 rounds per minute, according to Army documents , and local news outlets have reported that Mateen fired 202 rounds at the nightclub. Claims that the math doesn’t add up also lay out an incorrect chain of events — claiming that after Mateen stormed the club he holed up for three hours and then engaged in a gun battle with nine police officers for over an hour. In reality, the entire ordeal lasted about three hours. After smuggling his weapon past a security guard or shooting his way into the club, Mateen unleashed a hail of bullets. An off-duty officer who had been working at Pulse was among the first responders, and quickly engaged him in a shoot out, the New York Times reports : Chief Mina said that an off-duty officer who had been working at Pulse responded to shots fired at about 2 a.m. Sunday. Additional officers rushed to the scene, he said, and entered the nightclub, where they engaged in a gun battle with Mr. Mateen, forcing him to retreat to a bathroom where officers believed he had four to five hostages. About 15 to 20 people were in another bathroom. Mina said that things “kind of stabilized” after Mateen barricaded himself in the bathroom, and he established phone contact with police and called 911: “He was cool and calm when he was making those phone calls to us,” Chief Mina said. “We had a team of crisis negotiators that did talk to the suspect, just trying to get as much information as possible, and they focused on what they could do to resolve the situation.” But, he added, “he really wasn’t asking for a lot and we were doing most of the asking.” Asked about reports that Mr. Mateen was laughing or celebrating, the chief said there was no sign of that in the phone conversations. “There was talk about bomb vests, about explosives, throughout,” and eventually “there were statements made about imminent loss of life.” After Mateen talked about explosives and more causalities, police used an explosive device and an armored vehicle to blow through an exterior wall of the bathroom, which allowed hostages to flee. Mateen came out shooting and was killed in a gun battle with police. So, the entire ordeal lasted about three hours from 2 a.m. – 5 p.m. And, for most of that time, Mateen was barricaded inside a bathroom. He fired about 200 rounds when he first entered the club, but it’s not clear how many he fired in total, including the last exchange with police. Given that claims that the math doesn’t add up get the key events wrong — the type of gun used, how many shots were fired and the timeline of events — we’re calling this one fiction. ","Terrorism"
"Denny’s Waitress Assaulted by Muslim Men for Serving Bacon-Fiction!","2016-06-16 15:34:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dennys-waitress-assaulted-muslim-men-serving-bacon/"," A report that two Muslim men assaulted a Denny’s waitress because she served pork during Ramadan has gone viral. "," A fake news website is behind this false report of a Denny’s waitress being assaulted for serving bacon during Ramadan. The story originated at JTXH News under the headline “Denny’s Waitress Assaulted by Muslims for Serving Bacon During Ramadan” that begins: ROUND ROCK TX: A Denny’s waitress was allegedly assaulted by two Muslim men for serving pork during Ramadan. The woman, an 18 year old that had just graduated high school, was working at a local Denny’s restaurant when she was reportedly insulted by two passers-by on Wednesday. The men are said to have started to abuse her when they saw she was serving bacon to customers, The Times reported. She said one of the men screamed she was a “whore” and slapped her across the face, leaving her with a black eye after she was knocked to the ground. The story was widely shared on social media, and many believed that it was an actual news report about a waitress being assaulted for doing her job. However, JTXH News is a relatively new fake news website that was launched in April 2016. The site doesn’t clearly identify itself as fake or satirical news, which often leads to confusion. The fake Denny’s report even generated enough interest that the Statesman , a daily newspaper based in Austin , contacted local police about it: Round Rock police spokesperson Angelique Myers said there is no truth to the story. “The website is not one bit credible,” she said by email. Despite its lack of credibility, the story has been shared through social media and has garnered 61 comments on the website as of Wednesday afternoon. Most of the comments condemn the two men and contain anti-Muslim rhetoric. Alfonso Ruiz, an operating partner for the Denny’s restaurants in Round Rock and New Braunfels, said the corporate arm of the restaurant franchise made him aware of the story. “It’s unbelievable because I’m in my restaurant all the time,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d come up with a story like this.” In its short lifespan, JTXH News has (falsely) reported on a NASA announcement about “God and Religion,” and that Chic-fil-A is considering banning “anyone who can’t figure out their gender.” The story of a Denny’s waitress being assaulted by two Muslim men for serving bacon falls into the same category as those two stories: fake news.

"Hillary Clinton’s Connection to Orlando Shooter Omar Mateen-Reported as Fiction!","2016-06-15 09:17:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clintons-connection-orlando-shooter-omar-mateen/"," In the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting that left 50 dead, accusations have been made that Hillary Clinton stopped an FBI investigation that could have prevented it. "," Claims that Hillary Clinton stopped an investigation into Omar Mateen because it “unfairly singled out Muslims” are unfounded. Shortly after Omar Mateen killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando before police killed him, accusations and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton’s role in allegedly stopping an FBI investigation began to fly online. First of all, Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state did not overlap with FBI investigations into Omar Mateen. Clinton’s last day in office was in January 2013, and the FBI didn’t initiate its investigation into Omar Mateen until May 2013. FBI Director James Comey has said that Omar Mateen was investigated for 10 months in 2013 and again in 2014 after the bureau received tips about him: …We first became of him in May of 2013. He was working as a contract security guard at a local courthouse, and he made some statements that were inflammatory and contradictory that concerned his coworkers about terrorism. First he claimed family connections to al Qaeda. He also said he was a member of Hezbollah, which is a Shia terrorist organization that is a bitter enemy of ISIL. Comey said Omar Mateen was tailed and interviewed twice over the course of a 10-month investigation, and that he said he only made the comments because his coworkers were teasing him about his Muslim faith. Then, in 2014, the FBI initiated a second investigation after it was revealed that Omar Mateen worshiped at the same mosque as a Florida man who blew himself up as part of an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, and that the FBI’s investigation turned up “no ties of consequence” between the two men. Neither of those FBI investigations of Omar Mateen overlapped with Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, and there’s been no indication by Comey that these investigations were stopped early because of concerns about religious profiling. Additional rumors that Hillary Clinton stopped an FBI investigation into the Fort Piece, Florida, mosque where both Omar Mateen and the Syrian suicide bomber worshiped. There haven’t been any official documents or records produced to support that claim, however. And FBI Director James Comey has indicated that Omar Mateen was radicalized online — not at a mosque in Fort Piece anyway. Considering that Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state did not overlap with two FBI investigations into Omar Mateen, and that there’s no evidence that Mateen was radicalized at the mosque in Fort Pierce or that Hillary personally stopped an investigation there, we’re reporting this rumor as “fiction.” ","Terrorism"

"," There was just one shooter at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Omar Mateen. Rumors that the media has conspired to cover up that there were as many as three shooters at the club and that two got away were started by an unreliable Facebook user who has been known to falsely drum up hysteria in the past. Cody Agnew posted an account of the Pulse nightclub shooting that he allegedly heard second hand from someone who was working at the Pulse at the time of the shooting: Earlier I had posted about my employee’s sister who was at the club when the whole situation went down. I just got some updates. She took 12 bullets, 11 were removed and one is in her liver and can’t be taken out. She is coherent, fairly stable, and VERY lucky to still be alive. But that’s not the point of this post. There are bits of information that the media aren’t telling us. Mind you, this is coming directly from a survivor of the attack: there are two others that were in the club slaughtering people last night that were not caught. They are still out there and they are armed and dangerous. The media is not reporting this because they don’t want to scare everyone, but I think it’s important that people know. Friends, please stay safe. I would probably avoid theme parks, clubs, shopping malls or anywhere with a high concentration of people for a little while. I’m not trying to spread fear, rather awareness, and make sure that all of my friends stay alive… Within a day, the post had been shared more than 70,000 times, and many took Cody Agnew’s claims at face value and believed that there were three shooters at the Orlando nightclub and that every media outlet chose not to report it because “they don’t want to scare everyone.” But the post and Cody Agnew’s entire Facebook profile were quickly deleted after users began coming forward that he was incredible and hand made false posts in the past to generate attention and even to scam people out of money. Another Facebook user re-posted screenshots of gushing messages that Cody Agnew had sent to famous singers and said “he just wants attention and to spread hysteria”: The Orlando Police Department also came forward on Twitter to directly address rumors that there was more than one shooter: The local police department would have no reason to lie about there being just one shooter, and doing so could help the other shooters get away, or lead to another mass casualty incident. Given that, and Cody Agnew’s lack of credibility, we’re calling reports of more than one shooter at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando fiction ","Terrorism"

The story quoted excerpts from Fareed Zakaria’s so-called “private blog”: “The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation. Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.” The fake report parodied and referenced an actual column that Fareed Zakaria wrote for the Washington Post . In that column, Zakaria, an Iranian-born man who immigrated to America as a child, questioned “America’s self-destructive whites.” Nowhere in that column (or any other), however, did Zakaria call for jihad or rape.

"Bulk Cell Phones Purchased, Propane Tanks Stolen in Missouri-Truth!","2015-12-14 09:46:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bulk-cell-phones-purchased-propane-tanks-stolen-in-missouri/"," A group of men bought more than 60 pre-paid cell phones at Walmart stores in Missouri, and dozens of propane tanks were stolen from nearby convenience stations, sparking fear of imminent terrorist attacks among online communities. "," Police in Missouri have confirmed that more than 100 pre-paid cell phones were purchased and dozens of propane tanks were stolen near Kansas City, Missouri, in early December 2015. Local police departments in Missouri said that they alerted the FBI about the bulk pre-paid cell phone purchases and propane tank thefts as a precautionary measure, but they didn’t warn of any imminent threats of terrorist activity. Still, in the wake of terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and California, those reports have sparked fear among online commentators. Here’s what we know: Police were called to a Walmart in Lebanon, Missouri, on December 5, 2015, for a report of suspicious activity. According to an incident report released by the Lebanon Police Department , an officer spoke with two male subjects about “electronics purchasing” and determined that no crime had been commitment: On Saturday December 5, 2015 at approximately 0352 hours I was dispatched to 1800 S. Jefferson in reference to suspicious activity regarding electronics purchasing. Upon my arrival, I made contact with two male subjects that were pointed out by store employees. Upon speaking the two males, it was determined that there was no further reason to detain the subjects and they were allowed to leave. Police in Ava, Missouri, also responded to a report of suspicious cell phone purchases at a Walmart store on December 5. Ava police said that they’d learned the same man who purchased 60 pre-paid cell phones at the Walmart in Lebanon had purchased “a large amount” of cell phones at the store in Ava, according to a news release . There were similar reports of bulk cell phone purchases at stores in nearby Columbia, Jefferson City and Macon around the same time. Thirty-two cell phones were purchased at the Walmart in Macon, and an unspecified number of phones were purchased in Columbia. Then, on December 10, reports surfaced that 48 pre-paid cell phones had been purchased in Jackson and 10 had been purchased in Cape Girardeau, local CBS affiliate KFVS 12 reports : Cape Girardeau Police Chief Wes Blair says up to 10 pre-paid cell phones were purchased the same day at the Cape Girardeau Walmart. Both the Jackson and Cape Girardeau police departments turned over their investigations to the FBI. A witness who does not want to be identified says that she and a family member saw a man with several pre-paid cell phones in his shopping cart Friday at the Cape Girardeau Walmart on William Street. She thought it was suspicious and wondered if maybe he was going to re-sell them. Another witness says she saw the victim at the cash register purchasing the phones in pairs. She says she thought it was suspicious, but was told by the cashier that the person was price-matching and getting a deal. “Historically there have been large purchases of pre-paid cell phones throughout the United States that are shipped overseas just because there is a market for that,” Cape Girardeau Police Chief Wes Blair said. “So that’s what the FBI is for to vet all of that out and determine it, which is why we’ve taken everything we learned so far and forwarded it to them.” Later that night, the woman said that same family member went to the Jackson Walmart and saw the same man with another individual buying several pre-paid phones. “They do a lot for resale on those phone too, but we don’t want to take any chances,” Jackson Police Chief James Humphreys said. A total of five police departments contacted the FBI about the cell phone purchases. Still, the departments said that no crimes had occurred and there was no reason to detain the men who bought the phones. AN FBI spokesperson in Missouri said it’s not uncommon to receive these types of reports from local law enforcement agencies and confirmed pending investigations in three of the five reports: An FBI spokeswoman in Kansas City, Missouri, Bridget Patton, said Thursday it is not uncommon for local law enforcement to contact that federal agency if they deem something suspicious. Patton would not say if the FBI is formally investigating. Prepaid cellphones, popular among international travelers and consumers with poor credit, also are commonly used by drug dealers and gang members because they don’t require personal data be given to the seller or service provider, masking the user’s identity. Such phones also have been linked to suspected terror activity including by a man accused of plotting to bomb Times Square in 2010 and using a prepaid phone to communicate with co-conspirators in Pakistan. Police reports and interviews with investigators where the transactions took place did not disclose demographics about the buyers. Then, reports of dozens of stolen propane tanks in the same area of Missouri sparked even more panic about possible terrorist activity. A local Fox News affiliate in Kansas City reported that 18-20 propane tanks had been stolen from outside cages of gas stations in Lee’s Summit in November. Two weeks later, 28 propane tanks were stolen from a CVS in Independence, Missouri. But a retired FBI agent said it was unlikely that terrorists would steal propane tanks to make a bomb: Retired FBI agent Michael Tabman says it is up to law enforcement to investigate and try to connect the dots. “Certainly, we hear something about gas being stolen we worry about a potential bomb. The good news is this is probably not part of terrorist planning for a number of reasons,” Tabman told FOX 4’s Shannon O’Brien. “One is they wouldn’t steal these items because they know that would attract law enforcement’s attention. Also this would not be a tool of choice,” he continued. The FBI would not comment on the cell phone purchases or propane thefts, only saying that they encourage the public: If you see something, say something. In conclusion, we can confirm that the FBI is investigating bulk pre-paid cell phone purchases at Walmart stores in Missouri. We can also confirm that dozens of propane tanks have been stolen from the outside cages of stores in the same area of Missouri. However, there’s currently nothing linking those two things together, or that these events signal an elevated risk for terrorist activity. Contrary to some online reports, Missouri has not been placed on “high alert,” and there haven’t been any national security advisories issued about this. Check back for updates. ","Terrorism"

"," Reports that mosques in France have been raided and shut down in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13th are true. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on December 2nd that French officials had shut down three mosques and had detained 22 people who were believed to have participated in “Islamist radicalization.” In one of the mosques, located about 22 miles east of Paris, authorities seized a 9mm revolver, a hard drive and documents, the Wall Street Journa l reports: The sweep was part of the government’s massive security crackdown in the weeks sincecoordinated attacks on the streets of Paris left 130 people dead and hundreds injured. Since President François Hollande declared a state of emergency the night of the attacks, police have conducted more than 2,200 raids on homes and businesses, detained 232 people and seized 334 weapons, including 34 military weapons. The other mosques closed since the declaration of a state of emergency are in Lyon and Gennevilliers, a northwestern Paris suburb, Mr. Cazeneuve said. “We will be totally firm against all those who preach hate in France,” Mr. Cazeneuve told lawmakers. Despite the raids, French officials have cautioned against concluding that mosques in France are hotbeds for radicalization. “We must not cut ties with loyal Muslims of good faith,” Lagny-Sur-Marne’s mayor, Jean-Paul Michel, said on French television channel BFMTV. A leading French Imam told Al Jazeera that many more shutdowns were likely in the days ahead. Hassan El Alauoi said that he expected between 100 and 160 mosques to be closed based on conversations with the interior ministry: “This kind of speech shouldn’t even be allowed in Islamic countries, let alone secure countries like France,” El Alaoui, who became the first Muslim prison chaplain-general in 2005, said. The recent mosque closures, he added, were made under “a legal act that the authorities have” and must have happened because “of some illegal things that they found”. The imam also rejected those suspected of carrying out the suicide bomb and gun attacks, which left 130 people dead, as “terrorists”. So, it’s true that three mosques have been shut down in Paris, and that more shutdowns could follow. ","Terrorism"

"Jimmy Carter Banned Iranians from Entering the U.S.-Mostly Fiction!","2015-12-09 11:47:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jimmy-carter-banned-iranians-from-entering-the-u-s/"," President Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from entering the U.S. during the hostage crisis that played out at a U.S. embassy in Iran in the early ‘80s, according to reports. "," Jimmy Carter didn’t ban Iranians from entering the U.S. — but he did strip non-immigrant Iranians of visas and temporarily suspended new visas to Iranians. Jimmy Carter took those steps during the Iranian Hostage Crisis that spanned from 1979-81. However, immigration data shows that more Iranian immigrants were actually allowed into the country during those years due to political asylum laws — so the claim that Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from entering the U.S. is mostly false. Jimmy Carter’s action on Iranian immigration during the early 80s was drudged up after Donald Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. during the 2016 presidential campaign. Critics compared Carter’s action to Trump’s proposals and argued that the media and liberals had treated Trump unfairly. Aside from the fact that Jimmy Carter didn’t actually “ban” Iranians from entering the country (more on that below), there’s one more big difference: Jimmy Carter’s action on Iranian immigrants was based on nationality, not religious beliefs. Trump’s proposal, on the other hand, targets those who practice a specific religion. Jimmy Carter declared a state of emergency after a mob of Islamic revolutionaries overtook a U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. Sixty Americans were held hostage there for 444 days in what would become known as the “ Iranian Hostage Crisis .” During that time, Carter declared a state of emergency, advanced economic sanctions against Iran and issued the executive order in question on November 27, 1979. The official text of Executive Order 12172 reads : DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO ENTRY OF CERTAIN ALIENS INTO THE UNITED STATES By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 USC 1185 and 3 USC 301, it is hereby ordered as follows: SECTION 1-101. Delegation of Authority. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are hereby designated and empowered to exercise in respect of Iranians holding nonimmigrant visas, the authority conferred upon the President by section 215(a) (1) of the Act of June 27, 1952 (8 USC 1185), to prescribe limitations and exceptions on the rules and regulations governing the entry of aliens into the United States. SEC. 1—102. Effective Date. This order is effective immediately. JIMMY CARTER The White House, November 26, 1979. The executive order effectively revoked the visas of non-immigrant Iranian visitors and suspended new visas to Iranian citizens. The measure, according to a Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans report , mostly impacted Iranian students studying in the U.S.: A number of Iranians were deported from the United States and those who were immigrants were required to report to their local Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) office for extensive interviews. During this period, 56,700 Iranian students reported to the INS and almost 7,000 were found to be in violation of their visas, of whom a number were deported, while most applied for political asylum, fearing that return to Iran would result in their persecution. The discrimination and difficulties that Iranians experienced throughout this time increased their motivation to blend into and comport themselves as productive members of United States. Immigration data does not support the claim that Jimmy Carter “banned” Iranians from coming to the U.S. in those years, however. Thanks to U.S. political asylum laws, there was actually an uptick in the number of Iranians admitted in to the U.S. in 1979 and 1980, according to State Department data: After the Iranian Hostage Crisis was resolved, the number of Iranians immigrating to the U.S. continued to rise. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out, many young men fled the country to avoid fighting in the conflict, according to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans: Following the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980, an exodus of young men eligible for military service and middle class professionals ensued in Iran, and is reflected in the INS records depicting the relatively high number of men entering the United States. 22 Between 1981 and 1990, 116,172 Iranians immigrated to the United States. 23 Young men who were at risk of being drafted to fight in the Iran-Iraq War (1980 – 1988) became the beneficiaries of United States political asylum laws. 24 Between October 1981 and February 1985, more Iranians were granted asylum — 11,055 in total — than any other nationality. Thousands of other Iranians, however, remained in the United States illegally, working odd jobs, living with relatives and family, and making every effort to pass detection by INS agents and deportation back to Iran. So, Jimmy Carter revoked the visas of non-immigrant Iranians in the U.S. and temporarily suspended issuing new visas to Iranians. But immigration data shows that Carter didn’t “ban” Iranians from entering the country, as has been claimed. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has proposed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country.” That proposal targets individuals who practice a certain religion, not citizens of a government that the U.S. is in conflict with. Trump elaborated on his remarks in a written proposal: “Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.” In conclusion, we have classified this rumor as “mostly false” for two main reasons. First, Jimmy Carter didn’t actually ban Iranians from entering the U.S. Second, Jimmy Carter’s action targeted people based on nationality, and Trump’s targeted people based on religion, which makes the proposals very different.

"72 DHS Employees on a Terrorist Watch List-Fiction!","2015-12-08 11:06:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/72-dhs-employees-on-a-terrorist-watch-list/"," It’s been reported that 72 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees are on a terrorist watch list. "," Claims that 72 DHS employees are on a terrorist watch list are false. An inspector general report found that 73 airport employees across the country — not DHS employees — had not been properly vetted for possible links to terrorism. These rumors can be traced back to a Boston Public Radio interview with U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts, on December 1, 2015. When asked why Lynch was one of 47 Democrats who backed a GOP bill to ramp up screenings for Syrian and Iraqi refugees, he answered: …Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate. Stephen Lynch’s comment that 72 DHS employees are on a terrorist watch list were immediately picked up by blog sites, and by right-wing blog sites in particular. Lynch’s statement stirred panic because he seemed to assert that people suspected of terrorism could actually be working within the DHS. We tracked down the inspector general report that Stephen Lynch referenced, and he was flat wrong. The report did not say there were 72 DHS employees on a terrorist watch list. The report, called “TSA Can Improve Aviation Worker Vetting,” looked at how the Transportation Security Administration (which is under the DHS) vets aviation workers for potential links to terrorism. The report found that the “multi-layered process” for vetting aviation employees was “generally effective.” However, the portion of the report that Stephen Lynch referenced found that: …In addition to initially vetting every application for new credential, TSA recurrently vetted aviation workers with access to secured areas of commercial airports every time the Consolidated Terrorist Watchlist was updated. However, our testing showed that TSA did not identify 73 individuals with terrorism-related category codes because TSA is not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current interagency watch listing policy. So, it’s true that the report found that TSA vetting missed 73 airport employees that had been assigned “terrorism-related category codes.” DHS Inspector General John Roth testified before a congressional committee in June 2015 to explain the report’s findings: Despite rigorous processes, TSA did not identify 73 individuals with links to terrorism because TSA is not cleared to receive all terrorism categories under current inter-agency watchlisting guidance.4 At our request, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) performed a data match of over 900,000 airport workers with access to secure areas against the NCTC’s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). As a result of this match, we identified 73 individuals with terrorism-related category codes who also had active credentials. According to TSA officials, current interagency policy prevents the agency from receiving all terrorism-related codes during vetting. TSA officials recognize that not receiving these codes represents a weakness in its program, and informed us that TSA cannot guarantee that it can consistently identify all questionable individuals without receiving these categories. In 2014, the TSA Administrator authorized his staff to request some missing category codes for vetting. However, according to an official at the DHS Office of Policy, TSA must work with DHS to formalize a request to the Watchlisting Interagency Policy Committee in order to receive additional categories of terrorism-related records. So, Lynch’s claim that 72 DHS employees were on a terrorist watch list is false. The report he cited found 73 airport employees — not DHS employees — had possible links to terrorism and had not been properly vetted by the TSA. And that does not mean that those 73 employees were in fact terrorists, only that they had not been properly vetted. Lynch, with his claim that 72 DHS employees were on a terrorist watch list, played into a popular conspiracy theory that radical Islamic terrorists have infiltrated the White House and other governmental posts and are prepared to toppled the U.S. government. Also, Lynch’s claim that “the director had to resign” over the report’s findings is false. DHS Director Jeh Johnson held the post when the report was released, and he still held the post at the time of Lynch’s interview. However, the acting head of the TSA was reassigned after the report came out, the Wall Street Journal reports . ","Terrorism"

TruthorFiction.com has debunked rumors about stolen UPS uniforms in the past , and reports about ISIS terrorists wearing stolen UPS uniforms are a new variation on it. On November 18, 2015, days after terrorist attacks on Paris, a homeland security alert that appeared to be issued by the Department of Homeland Security went viral on Facebook. The letter warned that 32,000 UPS uniforms had fallen into the hands of ISIS terrorists who purchased them on Ebay. After a sheriff in Alabama “shared” the bogus warning about ISIS terrorists dressed as UPS delivery drivers on Facebook, the story took off. A day later, Talladega Sheriff Jimmy Kilgore apologized for sharing the false warning: TruthorFiction.com also spoke with a UPS spokesperson that confirmed that there have been no reports of stolen UPS uniforms, and there is no threat of imposters posing as UPS delivery drivers. “This is a hoax,” Susan Rosenberg, the pubic relations director at UPS, told us. “UPS actively monitors the unauthorized re-sale of UPS uniforms on E-Bay and takes measures to remove them from the public domain. As a matter of safety and security it is prudent in any situation to ask for an ID from any delivery personnel if you are in doubt.” This old rumor about stolen UPS uniforms for sale on Ebay is still false.

Some who were frustrated with the response of U.S. and European leaders to ISIS terrorist attacks applauded the moxie of Vladimir Putin’s comment on terrorists. But soon news broke that the quote had been misattributed to Vladimir Putin on Facebook, and Remi Maalouf issued an apology for spreading the false rumor: And if Putin’s so-called quote sounds familiar, you may have heard Denzel Washington say something similar in the 2004 movie “Man on Fire.” In the movie, Denzel says, “Forgiveness is between them and God, it’s my job to arrange the meeting”: Vladimir Putin’s alleged quotes on Muslim extremists have gone viral in the past. A chain email that has been circulating the web for years claims that Vladimir Putin said “no to sharia” in a speech before the Russian Parliament, but we found that one to be false as well . We did find at least one quote that Vladimir Putin actually made on terrorists, however.

"," A so-called ISIS kill list of U.S. cities has been misrepresented on social media sites. The terrorist group released the ISIS kill list in March 2015. At the time, ISIS released the names, photos and home addresses of U.S. Armed Forces personnel who it said had taken part in the war on terror and called for extremists to attack them in their hometowns. ISIS was able to get the contact info for U.S. Armed Forces personnel by hacking into Department of Defense servers. A local news station in Texas reporting on the data breach released a list of 56 U.S. cities that the military personnel lived in, and said that security in those cities would likely be heightened. That list of 56 U.S. cities is exactly the same as the ISIS kill list that went viral after the November 2015 terrorist attacks on Paris: Texas: Abilene, New Braunfels, San Antonio, Wyle, Fort Hood, Bedford, Killeen Indiana: Michigan City, Bolivar Michigan: Dearborn Heights, Lake Orion Connecticut: Barkhamsted, Manchester Nevada: Reno Georgia: Griffin Maryland: Upper Marlboro, Warrensburg, Lexington Park Arizona: Phoenix Louisiana: Shreveport, Bossier City South Carolina: Daniel Island, Charleston North Carolina: Fayetteville, New Bern Virginia: Burke, Virginia Beach, Suffolk, Springfield, Norfolk, Chesapeake Colorado: Colorado Springs California: Hanford, Solvang, San Ardo, Monterrey, Newberry Park, Carlsbad New Mexico: Farmington North Dakota: Minot South Dakota: Rapid City Florida: Merritt Island, Palm Coast, Saint John, Middleburg, Saint Augustine Washington: Colton, Cheney, Seattle, Spokane, Anacortes Nebraska: Bellevue Illinois: Orland Park Rhode Island: Newport Idaho: Bonners Ferry So, it’s true that an ISIS kill list was released — but the kill list named specific military personnel members, not entire U.S. cities, and the kill list was not released in the wake of deadly terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015. After the attack on Paris, however, ISIS did threaten to attack at least one city in the U.S. In a video released after the Paris attack, an ISIS terrorist warned: “We say to the states that take part in the crusader campaign that, by God, you will have a day, God willing, like France’s and by God, as we struck France in the center of its abode in Paris, then we swear that we will strike America at its center in Washington,” the man said. Reuters reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not have “specific credible information of an attack on the U.S. homeland,” that the threat would be taken seriously. ","Terrorism"

"," Reports that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in New Orleans are false. That rumor started with The Hayride, a right wing blog site, on November 2, 2015. The website reported that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had been resettled in Louisiana, specifically in Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Metairie and New Orleans: The 10,000 Syrian refugees are first flown to the United States, according to the French news wire Agence France-Presse, with the State Department paying the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the airfare. Then, once the refugees arrive in the country, they could be dispersed across the 180 cities listed above, where they are to aided within the first 30 to 90 days in settling and finding employment in the area. After approximately 90 days, refugees are no longer eligible for the State Department-funded support that they were receiving through migrant and refugee services. However, they are able to join support programs through the Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, it is unclear how much the screening process for the 10,000 Syrian refugees will cost American taxpayers. To back up the claim that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had arrived in Louisiana, The Hayride linked to a Yahoo News story headlined, “How the US plans to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees.” But the story didn’t confirm that 10,000 Syrian refugees had arrived in Louisiana — it talked about how 10,000 refugees that President Obama plans to resettle in the country over the next 12 months would be vetted and located: Once the US State Department receives their case files it employs NGO contractors to pre-screen them for eligibility for refugee status, then they are subjected to health and security checks. Officers from the Department of Homeland Security fly from Washington to the camps and conduct interviews with candidates, seeking to weed out what a US official called “liars, criminals and terrorists.” Each case file is reviewed by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI’s terrorist screening center, the DHS, the Department of Defense and “other agencies” — US intelligence. “Refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States,” another State Department official told reporters. After the deadly terrorist attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, The Hayride’s false report that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had been resettled in New Orleans spread across various right wing blog sites and officially went viral. President Obama announced in September 2015 that the he would push for the U.S. to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees total — not just in New Orleans or Louisiana — in fiscal year 2016. As for New Orleans, The Times-Picayune reports that a total of 14 Syrian refugees had been settled in Louisiana so far in 2015 — not 10,000. So, reports that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in New Orleans are false. ","Terrorism"

"," Trey Gowdy, a Republican assemblyman from South Carolina, has been accused of altering Benghazi documents — but he disputes those claims. Gowdy is the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, the congressional panel investigating an attack on a U.S. embassy in Benghazi that left four Americans dead. Trey Gowdy asserted in a letter that an email from Hillary Clinton to outside advisor Sidney Blumenthal contained the classified name of an informant that the intelligence community relies upon, stating, “ This information, the name of a human source, is some of the most protected information in our intelligence community, the release of which could jeopardize not only national security but human lives.” Rep. Elija Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the select committee, then wrote a letter requesting that Gowdy correct the record after the CIA confirmed that the name of the informant was not classified, “debunking” Gowdy’s claim. Cummings also accused Gowdy of altering a document by adding redactions to make it appear that Clinton had leaked confidential information: To further inflate your claim, you placed your own redactions over the name of the individual with the words, “redacted due to sources and methods.”  To be clear, these redactions were not made, and these words were not added, by any agency of the federal government responsible for enforcing classification guidelines. Predictably, commentators began repeating your accusations in even more extreme terms, suggesting in headlines for example that “Clinton Burns CIA Libya Contact.” Contrary to your claims, the CIA yesterday informed both the Republican and Democratic staffs of the Select Committee that they do not consider the information you highlighted in your letter to be classified.  Specifically, the CIA confirmed that “the State Department consulted with the CIA on this production, the CIA reviewed these documents, and the CIA made no redactions to protect classified information.” Trey Gowdy denied the claim that the CIA had “debunked” his claims about Hillary Clinton in a letter to Cummings . Gowdy also said that the executive branch, not the CIA, declassified the informant’s name: Contrary to your assertion, the CIA did not inform the committee that anything about the facts stated in the October 7 letter “(was) wrong.” As usual, I would ask you to completely and accurately relate the facts rather than attempt to create an impression that is misleading based on an incomplete and selection recitation of the facts. In fact, my understanding is the CIA advised the committee in a very brief email late Saturday night that it had reviewed the material in question and asked for no material to be redacted. In fact, the name of the alleged source was redacted from the material cleared for public release by someone in the executive branch…” So, it’s true that the ranking Democrat on the House Select Committee on Benghazi accused Trey Gowdy of misrepresenting facts and altering a document to paint Hillary Clinton in a negative light — but Gowdy has disputed those allegations. The CIA has declined to weigh-in publicly. ","Terrorism"
"10,000 Passports Seized in Bulgaria Were Bound for Islamic Terrorists-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-10-12 13:58:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/10000-passports-seized-in-bulgaria-were-bound-for-islamic-terrorists/"," Officials in Bulgaria seized a box of 10,000 fake Syrian passports that were going to be given to Islamic terrorists to gain entry into Europe. "," It’s true that 10,000 fake Syrian passports were seized in Bulgaria, but there’s no indication that the passports were going to be given to Islamic terrorists. The rumor that 10,000 fake Syrian passports had been seized in Bulgaria started with a report that appeared in the German newspaper Der Tagesspigel about the refugee crisis fueling a black market for stolen or forged Syrian passports: Fake or real Syrian passports have become a coveted commodity on the black market in Germany and other countries. In Bulgaria, the police recently (seized) 10,000 false Syrian passports. The documents will be sold for a lot of money to prospective customers because they are important for a successful application for asylum in the West. Many of the approximately two million Syrians who arrived in recent years in Turkey, have no valid identity papers more. Some lost their passports during the escape, others never had papers: The Kurds in Syria, for example, were not considered as citizens, but as stateless persons of Damascus long. In other cases, the passes are long expired – in young Syrian men who have not yet performed their military service, the pass is valid for only two years. Few refugees venture out into the Syrian embassy or consulate in Turkey or elsewhere, to apply for an extension. For a long time it was not a big problem. But since Germany and other countries to the Syrian refugees promise almost automatic recognition of their asylum application, Syrian passports for the refugees have suddenly become very important and worth a lot of money. Many of the refugees who fled Syria because of the civil war don’t have passports. Either they were never issued a passport, they didn’t take their passport with them when they fled, or their passport has expired. Because Germany and other countries require Syrian migrants to show proof of identification and citizenship before they’re accepted, so there’s been a huge surge in demand for fake Syrian passports. And, in many cases, even actual political refugees from Syria need to buy Syrian fake passports — so the claim that all of those passports were going to Islamic terrorists is false. Also, migrants from other Middle Eastern and African countries are posing as Syrians to gain asylum in Germany and other European countries need to purchase fake or stolen passports, according to the report: Not only Syrians are interested in Syrian passports. Even as refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan will (pose as) Syrians to secure in this way a recognition as asylum seekers in Western Europe. So, it’s true that there’s a huge black market for fake Syrian passports, and that Bulgarian officials seized 10,000 fake passports. It’s not true, however, that those 10,000 passports were going to be given to Islamic terrorists. That rumor started after a story appeared at the New Observer website that reported Bulgarian officials had seized 10,000 fake Syrian passports. Then, Walid Shoebat linked to the story on his blog site and (falsely) reported that, “Bulgarian police discover boxes owned by Muslim refugees going to Germany, and in them they find 10,000 fake passports that Were going to be given to Islamic terrorist.” However, German reports don’t indicate that the passports were being smuggled by Muslim refugees — they were actually being smuggled by people looking to exploit the refugees. And there’s no indication that the Syrian passports were going to be given to an Islamic terrorist since so many actual political refugees from Syria need fake or forged passports to gain asylum in Germany.

"Loretta Lynch Announces “Strong Cities Network” Global Policing Initiative-Fiction!","2015-10-06 13:30:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/loretta-lynch-announces-strong-cities-network-global-policing-initiative/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Loretta Lynch Announces “Strong Cities Network” Global Policing Initiative- Fiction! Summary of the eRumor: U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has announced a new global policing initiative called the Strong Cities Network to help fight extremism. "," Loretta Lynch has unveiled an initiative called the Strong Cities Network, but it’s not a global police initiative, and it doesn’t have law enforcement powers. Conservative political activist Pamela Geller spread that rumor in a blog post in which she reported that the Strong Cities Network amounted to a global law enforcement initiative that would override American laws: Yesterday, Loretta Lynch announced before the United Nations that the Attorney General’s office, in collaboration with several US cities, will form a global law enforcement initiative called the Strong Cities Network. This is the implementation of UN rules and laws on US soil, bypassing Congress and circumventing the Constitution. (thanks to Noisy) The UN is a sharia-compliant world body, and Obama has insisted that jihad is not exclusive to Islam (which it is). So will the UN, driven largely by the sharia-enforcing  OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) and pro-Islamic Obama, use a “global police force” to crush counter jihad forces? I suspect this global police force will be used to impose the blasphemy laws under the sharia (Islamic law). But the Strong Cities Network doesn’t have the authority to enforce any laws, so it’s not a global police force. Rather, it’s a network of cities around the world who will share information and best practices to help prevent violent extremism, according to the Department of Justice : The SCN will connect cities, city-level practitioners and the communities they represent through a series of workshops, trainings and sustained city partnerships. Network participants will also contribute to and benefit from an online repository of municipal-level good practices and web-based training modules and will be eligible for grants supporting innovative, local initiatives and strategies that will contribute to building social cohesion and resilience to violent extremism. The SCN will include an International Steering Committee of approximately 25 cities and other sub-national entities from different regions that will provide the SCN with its strategic direction. The SCN will also convene an International Advisory Board, which includes representatives from relevant city-focused networks, to help ensure SCN builds upon their work. It will be run by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a leading international “think-and-do” tank with a long-standing track record of working to prevent violent extremism. Loretta Lynch said the Strong Cities Network would empower local communities by “promoting initiatives they design and lead themselves” to help prevent violent extremism: These efforts have shown us the power of harnessing local expertise and leveraging local leadership to create targeted and effective approaches to eradicating violent extremism in any community.  We have learned that open dialogue and consistent engagement with a wide range of constituents is essential to crafting strategies and forging partnerships that will address the full scope of the threats we face.  We have seen that communities must be empowered to take these steps themselves so that the prevention approaches they design are crafted for their unique situations.  And we have observed the need for a mechanism that will expand the most effective efforts to reach more people around the globe – a way to highlight the best local ideas so that they can be adapted for use in other communities. Another important detail is that cities aren’t required to join the Strong Cities Network. They have to “opt in.” New York Governor Bill de Blasio was among the first to do so, the New York Daily News reports : “The Strong Cities network will be a message to all families who have lost loved ones because of extremism that something is being done in a new and powerful way,” de Blasio said. He also stressed that the alliance would not focus on any one type of extremism, and pointedly referenced past violent attacks like the 1994 shootings on greater Boston Planned Parenthood clinics and the racially motivated Charleston, S.C., shooting in June that killed nine African-American churchgoers. “We will be vigilant against all forms of violent extremism, whether it’s based in religious, or racial, or nationalistic or ideological intolerance,” he said. However, civil liberties groups like the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Association of Muslim American Lawyers have voiced opposition to the Safe Cities Network because they fear it will unfairly target Muslims: In the letter, the groups cite the recent arrest of a Muslim high school student in Texas on suspicion of bomb making — when he actually brought a homemade clock to school — as evidence of how “high levels of suspicion” harm the community. It also referenced the NYPD surveillance programs that spied on Muslims, instituted under ex-Mayor Bloomberg, as an example of the kind of program they hoped to avoid. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the NYCLU, said she appreciated de Blasio’s comments about diversity, but said “today’s announcement raises concerns because what we have heard about CVEs indicates that they can be counterproductive, violative of constitutional rights and stigmatizing.” ","Terrorism"

"," There’s been no indication that Chris Harper Mercer was motivated by Islamist terrorism to murder 10 people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Those rumors surfaced shortly after authorities identified Chris Harper-Mercer as the gunman in the mass murder. It has since been reported that Harper-Mercer wasn’t affiliated with any religion and was opposed to the concept of organized religion, however. Shortly after the mass shooting, the conservative blogger Charles C. Johnson published a report headlined, “Confirmed: Chris Harper-Mercer is 26 Year-old Muslim Killer.” The report, which had been shared nearly 70,000 times on Facebook, supposedly linked Harper-Mercer to Islamist terrorism through a MySpace profile that he had created. After further review, however, Chris Harper-Mercer’s MySpace page would seem to indicate that he was not motivated by Islamist terrorism, not that he was. Harper-Mercer shared propaganda for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a Catholic nationalist group, on his profile page: Given that Catholic nationalists who wanted to push back against the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland established the IRA, it’s highly unlikely that someone with radical Islamic beliefs would spread the group’s propaganda. Chris Harper-Mercer also identified himself as “not-religious, but spiritual” in a profile that he posted on a dating website, which would seem unusual for a man with radical Islamic beliefs: Also, Harper-Mercer’s user name was listed on the site as“IRONCROSS45,” a reference to Nazism and symbol of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League : In the United States, however, the Iron Cross also became one of several Nazi-era symbols adopted by outlaw bikers, more to signify rebellion or to shock than for any white supremacist ideology. By the early 2000s, this other use of the Iron Cross had spread from bikers to skateboarders and many extreme sports enthusiasts and became part of the logo of several different companies producing equipment and clothing for this audience. Consequently, the use of the Iron Cross in a non-racist context has greatly proliferated in the United States, to the point that an Iron Cross in isolation (i.e., without a superimposed swastika or without other accompanying hate symbols) cannot be determined to be a hate symbol. Care must therefore be used to correctly interpret this symbol in whatever context in which it may be found. Then, later on, it was reported that a manifesto that Chris Harper-Mercer left behind on the science of the mass shooting made satanic references and said he would be “welcomed in Hell and embraced by the devil.” Few details about the manifesto, or Chris Harper-Mercer’s motives were made clear in the days following the mass shooting. But Chris Harper-Mercer’s father is from Lancashire, England, and local media there spoke with a police spokesperson about the manifesto: Last night a police source confirmed that Mercer – whose father Ian is from Preston, Lancashire – had left behind a typewritten manifesto along with a computer drive outlining his ‘motives’ for the massacre. ”He had a hatred of black people, women, everyone,’ the source said, adding: “The drive and manifesto are being analysed. There is a lot about his hatred of organised religion.” There has been a lot of speculation about what motivated Chris Harper-Mercer to kill, but there’s no indication that he was an Islamist terrorist.

Bowe Bergdahl are now ISIS leaders. "," Three of five detainees that were swapped for Bowe Bergdahl’s release haven’t become leaders of ISIS. That rumor started in September 2014 with a report published at the blog site Political Ears : It is being reported that at least 3 of the 5 detainees involved in the swap have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq as commanders and are using that rank to usher in an “Islamic Caliphate” (a Sunni Islamic Theocracy – contrary to Obama’s claims that ISIS is not Islamic). The “Taliban 5” who were transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to custody in Doha, Qatar, are Mohammad Fazl, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS. Political Ears, which identifies itself as “a conservative political website which focuses on news and opinions from a conservative perspective,” hasn’t identified a source for its report that three of the five released detainees have joined ISIS, so we can’t fact-check the particulars of that claim. But the movements of the five detainees from the prisoner swap have been well documented since they were released in May 2014, and there’s no indication that any of them are now leaders of ISIS. The detainees were released into the custody of Qatar, where they were housed and monitored on a one-year travel ban. Then, as the date approached for the travel ban to be lifted, the U.S. began renegotiating the terms, Vice News reports : After the deal was hatched in May 2014, the high-level militants known as the Taliban Five were sent to Qatar, where government officials have monitored their activities and movements and enforced the travel constraints. With the restriction nearing its June 1 expiration date and American officials alarmed that the former prisoners will return to the battle for Afghanistan, the Associated Press has reported that the United States government is discussing a possible extension of the ban with Qatar, though no details have been revealed. …As the ban’s expiration date approaches, four out of the five detainees remain on the United Nations’ blacklist that freezes their assets and imposes a separate travel restriction. But the UN ban’s effectiveness is evidently limited: the UN sanctions committee has conceded that it routinely receives reports suggesting that individuals who are barred from travel had become “increasingly adept at circumventing” the sanctions, particularly when it comes to travel, though the reports are as yet officially unconfirmed. In May 2015, Fox News reported that Qatar had agreed to extend the travel ban and monitoring of the five released detainees. The U.S.’s concern about the detainees returning to the battlefield stems from reports in January 2015 that one of the detainees was suspected of “militant activities” and had made contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan: The officials would not say which of the five men is suspected. But an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details. “What I can say with confidence is this individual has not returned to the battlefield, this individual is not allowed to travel outside Qatar, and this individual has not engaged in any physical violence,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday. There have been plenty of reports that the detainees are involved with ISIS, but none of them have proven true. ","Terrorism"

A caption reads, “Container with aid for ‘refugees’ was full of weapons and ammunition,” and a narrator speaks in Greek over the top of it: The video does show Greek customs officials unpacking illegal weapons that they’d intercepted — but those weapons were shipped from Turkey to Libya, not from Turkey to refugee camps in Europe, Reuters reports : A coast guard patrol boat raided the vessel on Tuesday, 20 nautical miles northeast of Crete. The freighter, with a crew of seven and which had sailed from the Turkish port of Iskenderun, was escorted to Heraklion port on the island. The United Nations has imposed an embargo on weapons shipments to Libya, which is plagued by factional conflict. “The ship’s crew is being questioned and the content of its containers will be checked,” a coast guard official said, declining to be named. The coast guard provided no further details of what kind of arms the freighter had on board, or its ownership. A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the cargo included weapons but said it was fully documented and was destined for the Sudanese police force.

"Ex-CIA Officer Clare Lopez Calls Obama a Radical Islamic Threat to America-Correct Attribution!","2015-09-09 12:46:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ex-cia-officer-clare-lopez-calls-obama-a-radical-islamic-threat-to-america/"," Ex-CIA Officer Clare Lopez called President Obama a radical Islamic threat to America. "," This one is true. Clare Lopez, a former CIA officer , said that President Obama has “switched sides” in the war on terror, and that he has the same goals that Osama Bin Laden had: to reduce U.S. influence in Islamic areas of the world. Clare Lopez has said for years that extremist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood have infiltrated the Obama administration and are carrying out their agendas through U.S. foreign policy. In August 2014, Lopez told the website WND that: Lopez told WND she sees a pattern in Obama’s actions, or inaction, that reveals his blueprint for the Middle East and Northern Africa is to let the warring jihadi factions, the Sunnis and the Shiites, divide the region into two spheres of influence, and for the U.S. to withdraw. “The administration’s plan, I believe, is to remove American power and influence, including military forces, from Islamic lands,” Lopez asserted. When WND remarked that was just what Osama bin Laden had demanded, Lopez pointed out that is the aim of all jihadis, “Because that is what Islam demands, that foreign forces be kicked out of Islamic lands.” Does Obama think if we leave the Mideast the jihadis will then leave us alone? “I don’t know,” she said. “I can just see the pattern that is enabling the rise of Islam, empowering the Muslim Brotherhood domestically and abroad, alienating and distancing ourselves from our friends and allies and debilitating the American military.” Then, a month later, WND reported that Lopez said Obama had “switched sides” in the war on terror by siding with groups like the Muslim Brotherhood: She said the global war on terror had been an effort to “stay free of Shariah,” or repressive Islamic law, until the Obama administration began siding with such jihadist groups as the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates. Why the switch? Lopez explained, when the so-called Arab Spring appeared in late 2010, “It was time to bring down the secular Muslim rulers who did not enforce Islamic law. And America helped.” And why would Obama want to do that? As she told WND earlier this month, Lopez believed the Muslim Brotherhood has thoroughly infiltrated the Obama administration and other branches of the federal government. This isn’t necessarily news, however. Clare Lopez has been accusing the Obama administration of being infiltrated by Islamic extremists and carrying out their agenda as far back as 2009: ","Terrorism"

"," Admiral James “Ace” Lyons delivered this speech at a “Defeat Jihad Summit” organized by the Center for Security Policy in February 2015. Admiral Lyons spent 36 years as a Naval officer. He last served as commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet under President Regan. Lyons now serves as president and CEO of a consulting firm that specializes in trade, anti-terrorism, port security and foreign affairs. Admiral Lyons said during his speech at the Defeat Jihad Summit that: A number of you heard me say before; we’ve had many opportunities to change the course of history. It hasn’t mattered if it’s been a Democratic or Republican administration; we’ve failed every one them. Starting with Carter and the takeover of our embassy. We could off Komini and Islamic fundamentalism at the knees. …We all say that we have to identify the threat. Well, I think the one who identified it best was (President Recep Tayip) Erdogan from Turkey who said, ‘Islam is Islam.’ There are no modifiers. Democracy is the train we ride to our ultimate objective. He couldn’t have said it any plainer. Until you recognize that Islam is a political movement masquerading as a religion, you’re never going to come to grips with it. As far as a strategy … the Obama administration has a strategy. It’s very simple; any thinking American should be able to grasp it. It’s anti-American, anti-western, it’s pro-Islamic, it’s pro-Iranian, and it’s pro Muslim Brotherhood. But President Erodgan’s quote that “Islam is Islam” appears to have been taken out of context by Admiral Lyons. Erodgan made the comment in 2007 in response to the phrase “moderate Islam” being used to describe the country, the Turkish publication Milliyet reports : Speaking at Kanal D TV’s Arena program, PM Erdogan commented on the term “moderate Islam”, often used in the West to describe AKP and said, ‘These descriptions are very ugly, it is offensive and an insult to our religion. There is no moderate or immoderate Islam. Islam is Islam and that’s it.” Erodgan’s “Islam is Islam” quote has been thought to mean that Islam and extremism are inseparable, but Erodgan was actually arguing the opposite when he made the statement : “The animosity, unfortunately, strengthens the scenarios that there is a so-called clash of civilizations in the world. Those, who defend such speculations, may go further to identify the terrorism with Islam which is based on peace,” he maintained, adding that the situation helps those who try to globalize Islamophobia. Drawing attention to the importance of mutual understanding and respect, Erdoğan stated that he believes and respects Moses and Jesus, and accepts them as prophets. “I expect the same attitude from a Jew or a Christian toward my own prophet,” Erdoğan noted. He underlined the importance of Turkey’s European Union membership in terms of establishing connections between the West and the East. “As a country whose population is mostly composed of Muslims, Turkey endeavors to get its place in the EU. Turkey’s effort is closely watched not only by European people but also by the citizens of Islam countries,” he said. “The thesis that the West and the East, Islam and other religions cannot reconcile, has become invalid in Turkey’s membership process.” ","Terrorism"
"Marc Thiessen’s Column on Obama “Courting Disaster” by Canceling Interrogations-Authorship Confirmed!","2015-08-19 12:43:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marc-thiessens-column-on-obama-courting-disaster-by-canceling-interrogations/"," A column authored by Marc Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, argues that President Obama’s decision to cancel advanced interrogation techniques is “courting disaster.” "," Marc Thiessen wrote the column on Obama courting disaster to promote his book, “Courting Disaster: How the CIA Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama is Inviting the Next Attack.” The courting disaster column was first published on January 18, 2010, by a blogsite called Power Line that’s operated by a group of conservative lawyers. The column reemerged in mid-2015 in forwarded emails. Marc Thiessen worked as the chief speechwriter for President Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during the Bush presidency. Today, he’s a political commentator who writes weekly columns for the Washington Post The Courting Disaster column opens with a reference to Richard Reid, the failed shoe bomber who tried to bring down a flight over Detroit on Christmas Day 2001: If the plane had exploded and crashed into downtown Detroit, thousands could have perished. Only luck saved us from catastrophe. We did not see this attack coming. By the Obama administration’s own admission, we know very little about this new terror network or its plans to attack America. In Courting Disaster, I explain that the reason why we were caught by surprise on Christmas Day — and the reason why we are in growing danger of suffering another terrorist attack — is that Barack Obama has eliminated the most important tool our nation has in the fight against terror: the ability to detain and effectively interrogate senior terrorist leaders. Marc Thiessen takes issue with Executive Order 13491 – Ensuring Lawful Interrogations , which Obama issued days after he took office in January 2009. The order calls for “effectiveness of human intelligence gathering, to promote the safe, lawful, and humane treatment of individuals in United States custody.” At the time, Thiessen and other critics warned that Obama was courting disaster by not using what has become known as “advanced interrogation techniques” to get information from captured terrorists. There have been new developments in the debate about CIA interrogation techniques since Marc Thiessen’s courting disaster book and column were published in 2010. For one, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report on CIA detention and interrogation programs in December 2014. The report made a number of conclusions: enhanced interrogation techniques were not effective in acquiring intelligence, the CIA used inaccurate claims to justify enhanced interrogation and there was little oversight, among other findings. Still, the report hasn’t changed the debate. Marc Thiessen has called it “partisan and shameful.” He also wrote in the Washington Post that Democrats had lost the torture debate after the report’s release. ","Terrorism"

The commentary titled “Europe Died in Auschwitz” was first published on November 21, 2004, by the Spanish website Gentiuno. The author is listed as Sebastián Vivar Rodriguez — not Sebastián Vilar Rodrigez , as reported in the eRumor. But aside from the “Europe Died in Auschwitz” commentary, there’s no record of a Spanish writer named Sebastian Vivar Rodriguez — or Sebastián Vilar Rodrigez — anywhere online. That means the name was likely made up to conceal the true author’s identity. The commentary suggests that 6 million Jewish people who were killed in the Holocaust were “traded” for 20 million Muslims who later came to Europe: In Auschwitz we burned a culture, thought, creativity, talent. We destroyed the chosen people, truly chosen, because they produced great and wonderful people who changed the world. The contribution of this people is felt in all areas of life: science, art, international trade, and above all, as the conscience of the world. These are the people we burned. And under the and because we wanted to prove to ourselves that we were cured of the disease of racism, we opened our gates to 20 million Muslims, who brought us stupidity and ignorance, religious extremism and lack of tolerance, crime and poverty due to an unwillingness to work and support their families with pride.

"Taxpayers Paid for Convicted Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s Family Travel Expenses-Truth!","2015-05-18 11:15:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxpayers-paid-for-convicted-boston-marathon-bomber-dzhokhar-tsarnaevs-family-travel-expenses/","s: Tax dollars paid for Boston Marathon Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s family to travel to the U.S. during his trial. "," This one is true, but it’s not clear exactly how much of the travel expenses were paid for with tax dollars. News outlets like the Boston Globe and FOX News reported that convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s family had arrived to Massachusetts in April 2015 to testify during the death penalty phase of his trial. FOX News reports : “As of Thursday , family members of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been staying at the Hampton Inn in Revere under very tight security, just one of the things tax dollars are paying for. FOX25’s Sharman Sacchetti investigated how much this trip is costing you. “Sources say these family members are being called as witnesses and not only that, at least three agencies are working around the clock to protect and transport them. This is all part of the defense team’s strategy to save Tsarnaev. While it’s unclear when their flight started, we know the last part of it came through Amsterdam and landed at Logan Airport and cost nearly $2,500 per person. “The cost to put them up at the Hampton Inn at the government rate: almost $200 per night, per person. And a source says at least three agencies, the FBI, US Marshal’s and Revere Police are involved in constant protection.” Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s defense team was expected to call his relatives to testify about the “impact of being reared in a traditional Chechen Muslim household” as jurors considered the death penalty, the Boston Globe reports : “The funds to bring Tsarnaev’s overseas relatives to Boston for the trial likely comes from federal money approved by the presiding judge for the defense. George Kendall, a New York attorney who specializes in death penalty cases nationwide, said the court system bears the cost of transporting all witnesses, whether they are an expert from a nearby state or a family member from abroad. “The defense must prove to the judge that the witnesses are critical for the defense case, in order for their travel to be paid for by the government, but they are not required to take the stand and testify. Legal specialists say the defense could ask for the family witnesses to help provide guidance on the case, but could decide they don’t need each of them to testify.” Because U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole, who presided over trial, had sealed the majority of documents related tothe Boston Marathon bombing trial, the exact cost of the travel expenses — and of the trial as a whole — are not known, Boston.com reports : “Some of the sealed documents could shed light on how many taxpayer dollars are going to pay for Tsarnaev’s defense. But we don’t know. Because they’re sealed. Chris Tritico, who represented Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, said the high volume of sealed documents could be designed to protect Tsarnaev. “’It’s important to remember that a defendant’s right to a fair trial trumps the public’s right,’ Tritico said. ‘When the court feels the media attention is so strong, it has to do something to protect the defendant’s rights.’” Death penalty trails are typically costly for taxpayers. The cost of legal representation alone in death penalty cases averaged about $218,000 through the 1990s. That doesn’t include travel and other costs for witnesses, experts, security and investigators, according to a government report . ","Terrorism"
"ABC News Bans Flag Lapel Pins – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-04-20 01:58:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abcflag/"," ABC News executives told reporters not to wear American flag lapel pins because the network should remain as neutral as possible. "," Rumors that ABC News has banned American flag lapel pins have been swirling ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim was based in truth at one time, but it has drifted more toward fiction over the years. The 9/11 attacks resulted in a wave of patriotism that had not been seen in decades. The shared enthusiasm for the country and flag were widespread. It created difficulties for reporters, however, who try to professionally earn and keep people’s trust by avoiding personal partisan displays while reporting in the news. Many media outlets struggled to preserve their image as journalists while at the same time appearing unpatriotic in a time of crisis. Some journalists elected to wear American flag lapel pins on air, and the debate started. CBS, NBC and CNN did not have a lapel pin policy in place before or after 9/11, the Orlando Sentinel reports . Reporters for those stations regularly wore American flag lapel pins on air while covering 9/11. When word got out that ABC News had “banned American flag lapel pins,” the network became a lightning rod for criticism. However, the eRumor began to drift away from the truth almost immediately. The network never specifically singled out American flag lapel pins — it prohibited its reporters from wearing any lapel pin on the air. David Westin, the former president of ABC News, said in a 2012 interview with CNN that he made the decision to stick with the no-lapel pin policy in the days that followed 9/11: “It came up while I was in the control room. As you’ll recall, we were on the air for about four and a half days straight — 24 hours, seven days a week with no commercial interruption or anything else. There was constant reporting coming in during that time and we were having to make decisions about what to do and what not to do … They came to us and said, ‘We are being asked why we’re not wearing lapel pins,’ because a number of other outlets, particularly cable news, were. Fox News in particular had integrated the American flag into the backdrop and bumpers and teases and everything else. And we’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort. The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly, ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision.” Ever since, the stance that ABC News takes on all lapel pins — including American flag lapel pins — has been widely misunderstood. Under the policy, reporters are simply asked not to wear lapel pins. What happens if they do anyway? Not much, apparently. Terry Moran, who covered the Bush administration for ABC News in 2001, chose to defy the network and wore a flag lapel pin . He still climbed the network’s ranks over the next decade and became co-anchor of the show “Nightline.” This eRumor has resurfaced a number of times over the years. After President Obama temporarily stopped wearing an American flag lapel pin in 2007, ABC News was accused of “following the president’s lead” in a series of viral emails. Considering the long standing lapel pin policy at ABC News, that claim is false. Then, in early 2015, another viral email claimed that ABC News had just ordered reporters not to wear “lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia.” That email was outdated and stretched the truth about the policy to begin with.

"," There’s no proof that there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico. This isn’t the first time that the claim has been made, either. Reports that ISIS fighters were being smuggled into the U.S. from a camp in Mexico first surfaced in September of 2014. The website Judicial Watch made the initial report , but the page later disappeared from the website. At the time, a number of politicians and websites spread rumors of an ISIS camp located just south of El Paso. In a conference call with a conservative non-profit group, U.S. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) said, “It is true that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez, or they were within the last few weeks.” Blog sites and publications repeated those claims, and the eRumor went viral. U.S. defense officials shot down the reports and said there was “no credible information” that ISIS planned to attack the U.S., the Guardian reports . Then, in a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing held in September of 2014, Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary Jennifer Lasley addressed the claim : “To date, we have not had credible reporting that either Hezbollah or any other terrorist group has been taking advantage of our borders to move individuals in an out. It’s something we are always looking for, but to date, we have not seen credible evidence of that.” Claims about the ISIS camp in Mexico faded away, and nothing ever came of it. Then, the exact same eRumor re-surfaced in April of 2015. Again, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS was camped in Mexico. Citing unnamed sources, the report said ISIS fighters were being shuttled into the U.S. by Mexican human traffickers. The report included a photo of a desert encampment. However, the photo doesn’t show an ISIS camp. The photo was taken in 2010, years before ISIS was formed. It shows a pre-school in Benito Juarez, Mexico. There’s currently no evidence that there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico, or that ISIS fighters are being smuggled into the U.S., so we are reporting this story as fiction.

"," This one is true, but it’s also outdated. Coach K grabbed headlines in September of 2014 when he commented on President Obama’s military strategy while accepting an award at the Association of the U.S. Army conference. The Daily Beast reports that Coach K told the conference: “I know it’s upsetting to many of you when you hear ‘no boots on the ground.’ It upsets me too, because that’s like saying I’m not going to play two of my best players. Because that’s what you are trained to do. And for decades and decades, the fact that we are a free country and we don’t play home games here is a result of having boots on the ground. That’s the problem. “It’s about letting your opponent know we are going to use our best players. And whether we use them or not, that’s up to the coach. You never tell your opponent you are not going to use (them), like I’m not going to play Grant Hill, J.J. Redick, Christian Laettner.” When national media outlets picked up the story in November of 2104, Coach K backed off and said that he didn’t criticize President Obama’s military strategy, the Charlotte Observer reports : “I’m passionate about the United States military and always will be an amazing supporter of the military. On that night nothing was ever said about President Obama, and nothing was ever said about ISIS. In fact, I hate even saying that word. “I do not hate saying the other word because I love President Obama. It’s amazing that it happened three weeks ago and on Election Day something is brought up and said in a way that I didn’t say. So be it.” It’s true that Coach K never specifically said “Obama” or “ISIS” in his remarks, but it seems obvious where his remarks were aimed. At the time, the term “ boots on the ground ” was at the center of national debate about the U.S. response to ISIS. This eRumor first appeared in 2014, and it reappeared after Duke won the NCAA national championship in 2015. Some were led to believe that Coach K made the comments after the national championship game, but that wasn’t the case. ","Terrorism"

"," This is a hoax…but has generated more mail to TruthOrFiction.com than any of the eRumors resulting from the terrorist attacks. Update! According to an article on Wired.com , the face in the picture of “The Last Picture” is a Hungarian named Peter who has declined to reveal his last name, but provided other pictures of himself from the same day on top of the World Trade Center to authenticate his claim.  He said he created the version with the jetliner using Photoshop and emailed it to a few of his friends as a joke.  It took off from there.  A young man in Brazil has previously claimed to be Tourist Guy and has gotten quite a bit of visibility as a result including an advertising contract with a major car manufacturer.  Some of Peter’s friends thought the record should be put straight and revealed his identity on a Hungarian news site . It’s kind of become a form of recreation to figure out all that is wrong with the picture. Several things to say about it, including some comments from our readers: 1. The most significant is that of the two towers of the World Trade Center, only one of them had an outside observation deck, tower #2, also called the south tower. 2. The south tower was struck by a United Airlines plane, not an American airlines plane.  The aircraft in this picture is an American jet. 3.  We’ve discovered what we think may be the source of the picture of the airliner in this photo.  It is from Airliners.net.

If such a thing as a camera with film had survived the collapse of the building and there were a picture of an airliner moments before impact, do you think the only way you would hear about it would be through a forwarded email?  Such a picture would be astonishing and showcased by media world-wide. 6.  We’ve had several emails from readers commenting that the date on the picture appears to be wrong.  The date doesn’t show up well in our reduced version of the picture, but the original does have “09-11-01” on it.  Here it is enlarged.  Some of the pixelization in and around the date is thought by many to be evidence that it was pasted into the picture. 7.  Numerous readers have pointed out that it was a nice September day on the eleventh and the person in this picture appears to be braced for the cold. 8.  TruthOrFiction.com reader James O. looked up the weather for that day from Accuweather.  The temperature was headed for a high of 81 degrees. 9.  Several readers pointed out that the angle of the shadows on the tower doesn’t seem to be evident on the airplane. 10.  James O. also pointed out that neither of the jetliners was in level flight when hitting the towers.  They both struck while in a banking turn. 11.  Reader Walter H. notes that the airplane seems to be too high compared with where the American jet hit the building. 12.  According to the former website topoftheworld.citysearch.com, the observation deck did not open to tourists until 9:30a.  The airliner attacks took place prior to that 13.  Many have written that if this picture had actually been taken at the World Trade Center, there would not be such a short railing.  Most high buildings have restraints to keep people from falling or jumping off.  On WTC 2 however, the observation deck did not go to the edge of the building.  If anyone went over the railing, they would fall to another deck below. 14.  Many have written to say that this picture appears to have come from a low-quality camera that would not have been likely to catch an airliner that is traveling at 300+ miles per hour without blurring.  We haven’t looked into that. 15.  Other emails ask whether both the tourist and whoever took the picture wouldn’t hear the jetliner approaching. update:9/14/12","Terrorism"
"FEMA Corps Team Members Are the Modern Day Hitler Youth-Fiction!","2015-03-23 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-corps-hitler-youth/"," This is a forwarded email that contains an article that compares a group of American youths who recently graduated from the FEMA Corps program to Hitler Youth.  The email also alleges that the Department of Homeland Security is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition. "," The origin of the eRumor comes from an October 7, 2012 article from the Whiteout Press but these are the ramblings of someone who appears to know very little about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and World War II history of Nazi Germany. According to their website, FEMA Corps is a program that creates a pool of trained team members ranging from ages 18 to 24 to assist in disaster recovery.   The mission of this program is to establish a unit of 1,600 service corps members dedicated to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The benefit of this program is to prepare participants “for careers in emergency management and other related fields, building depth in the emergency management community.”  The first 480 members began training in August 2012 and became ready for deployment in September 2012.  The next training program begins in Winter 2013. FEMA Corps members are compensated for their time. According to the FAQ on their website, “FEMA Corps members receive a living allowance of approximately $4,000 for the 10 months of service (about $200 every two weeks before taxes), housing, meals, limited medical benefits” and members can receive up to an additional $400 a month for childcare.   After the first 10 month term of service there is an option to extend for a second year. Comparison to Hitler Youth Hitler Youth were created in the 1920’s and targeted boys and girls from the ages of 10 to 18. It began as a voluntary program but in 1936, after Adolf Hitler came into power the program became compulsory.   According to the Historylearingsite , the “task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service. For girls, the organization prepared them for motherhood.”    Members of FEMA Corps do not fall into to this age range nor are they trained or prepared for the military. The photo in the forwarded email depicting a young team of FEMA Corps members fully armed and ready to respond is inaccurate. According to a May 13, 2009 article in the New York Times the group in the photo are Explorer Scouts in a simulated counter terrorism training exercise, which occurred in California’s Imperial County under the leadership of local law enforcement and Border Patrol. The article said, “The Explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence — an intense ratcheting up of one of the group’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.” DHS Armament? The writer of the eRumor also alleged that the DHS is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition.  The DHS oversees agencies that conduct  law enforcement, military missions, and immigration enforcement. In a February 14, 2013 article by Fox News , it was disclosed that DHS training centers have used as much as 15 million rounds annually for training exercises and practice on shooting ranges. The article also said that the DHS plans to purchase 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling it “the federal government’s second largest criminal investigative agency.” But ICE is not the only armed agency under the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Secret Service, the intelligence agency that was originally under the Department of the Treasury has the responsibility of protecting the President and dignitaries.  This agency has been under the blanket of the DHS since March 1, 2003.   One agency under the DHS that could be considered to be a major user of weapons and ammunition is the United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is on loan to the DHS from the Department of Transportation and has enough fire power to protect U.S. ports, chase and apprehend pirates and smugglers and assist in the protection of our military assets and facilities in the Persian Gulf. The USCG lists 212 aircraft, various vessels ranging in boats from 18 feet to 47 feet along with a fleet of cutters ranging from 65 feet to 179 feet.  The USCG also performs search and rescue for mariners in peril on the water. The USCG H-65 Dolphin helicopter in the photo above is usually armed with Single 7.62mm M240B/H machine gun, a 7.62mm shoulder-fired precision weapon and a .50-caliber shoulder-fired precision weapon. USCG Cutter Stratton pictured above is one of the newest ships in the fleet can carry USCG Helicopters and has an armament of 57mm Bofors Gun, 1 Phalanx, a CIWS 1B 20mm, four 50 caliber machine guns, as well as two M240B light machine guns.  The cutter is also capable of launching 25 Foot Defender Class Boats with gun mounts both forward and aft. Other agencies under the DHS, according to their organizational chart , are U.S. Customs & Boarder Protection, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, and Transportation Security Administration.   Each agency has members who carry and are trained to use weapons. Special Armored Vehicles The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV or “Humvee”) are real and some agencies receive training on these armored vehicles designated for Special Response Teams by the DHS.  The above photo shows members of  U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement in a special training exercise involving armored vehicles. Also, FEMA is the training agency for first responders from the local level to agencies under the DHS.   So that all agencies speak the same language at the scene of a disaster the Incident Command System was developed for all levels of government as well as private sector and by many nongovernmental organizations. updated 2/14/13 ","Terrorism"

"Nostradamus predicted the World Trade Center terrorism-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/terrorpredict/"," An eRumor is circulating that quotes what it says are predictions of the famous 16th century astrologer Nostradamus that seem to anticipate the attack on New York by terrorists on September 11.   The prophecy is said to have referred to the month and year, the location, and a reference that could be interpreted as referring to the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. "," Nostradamus experts say this not accurate. Part of the eRumor seems to be based on a writing of Nostradamus that goes like this: “At forty-five degrees the sky will burn, fire to approach the great new city: In an instant a great scattered flame will leap up, when one will want to demand proof of the Normans.” (quatrain 6-97) There is no reference in the original writing to the place called “york” and no reference to “the year of the new century and nine months.” Other parts of the eRumor seem to be based on the following text, “In the City of God there will be a great thunder, Two brothers torn apart by Chaos, while the fortress endures, the great leader will succumb.” That quote is not from Nostradamus, however.  It’s from Neil Marshall, a student at Brock University who created the text as part of a critique he wrote about Nostradamus. The bottom line is that the eRumor is not a authentic quote from Nostradamus. ","Terrorism"
"Air Force General Richard Hawley’s comments on the Attack on America-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hawley/"," A series of strongly worded observations about reactions to the Attack on America from a U.S. Air Force General, Richard Hawley. "," General Richard Hawley is now retired, but was most recently the commander of the Air Combat Command, headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.  He is a decorated pilot who flew more than 400 combat missions in Vietnam. TruthOrFiction.com contacted General Hawley and he says he did not write this eRumor that bears his name. He did, however, send us his own comments about the issues that the eRumor addresses: From the real General Richard Hawley: 1) Goodness, Evil and Relativity: There are some really good people in this world. They volunteer to help those who need it, and ask nothing in return. There are also some really bad people in this world. They exploit those who need help, or who have less wit or “charisma”, and motivate them to join in committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against people they don’t even know. Then there are the rest of us. Average people who try each day to do no harm, to provide for their families, to do an occasional act of kindness. The evil that was perpetrated against our land on 9/11 was the product of Mullahs who see our prosperity and power as a threat to their control over the uneducated Muslim masses on whose shoulders they ride through life. And so they preach hate. They are evil. 2) Violence begets violence: It’s true. Violence does beget violence. But sometimes there is no alternative but to confront those who would perpetrate evil acts against us. This is one of those times. We are blessed to have courageous men and women willing to put their lives on the line to track down and annihilate those who have been so imbued with evil as to be beyond redemption. But violence is not a strategy. It is a necessary and fully justified reaction to an unimaginable threat. But it is not a strategy. If we are to win this war, we must defeat the Mullahs. And to defeat the Mullahs, we must find ways to separate them from their uneducated flocks. We cannot kill all those who have been taught to hate us, nor should we wish to. Far better to change their minds than to change their state of being. 3) The intelligence community let us down: Well, maybe just a little. Lots of senior and not so senior intelligence people became just as enamored of high tech gadgets as their political masters. The protests over our evisceration of the human intelligence component of the agency were not very loud or forceful. Keeping spies on the ground is a high risk and often dirty business, and it wasn’t just liberal politicians who didn’t have much stomach for it. 4) Poverty is the breeding ground for terrorists: No, it isn’t; but religious extremism is. The Mullahs fear our wealth and power because it shows that a secular society with democratic institutions and a free market economy can do a better job of taking care of its peoples’ needs, both spiritual and physical, than the oppressive Islamic regimes that they aspire to lead. The Mullahs are the problem, not poverty, but poverty does make it easier for the Mullahs to spread their evil – as do governments that tolerate and even reinforce their hateful message. 5) Profiling: We are at war here! We are not talking about traffic stops. If we were at war with Iceland, I would expect those charged with our defense to pay very close attention to any Icelander who ventured near our shores. In this war I expect them to pay very close attention to Muslims with ties to the places that spew hatred against us. Random checks when there are no such obvious targets available are a good way to keep the evil ones guessing, but let’s not make small children and grandmothers take their shoes off while we watch far more likely candidates walk aboard unchecked. 6) Resolutions: a. Never forget that what happened on September the 11th of 2001 was an act of war. b. Never sit silently by while someone tries to justify what happened on that day as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East or elsewhere. c. Fly our nation’s flag proudly – it represents this world’s greatest hope to move beyond the pain and suffering that inflict so many across the globe. Richard E.

"Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, views on September 11-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/falwell-robertson-wtc/"," There are several different versions of the eRumor.  Some say that in an Interview on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club telecast, Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell seemed to be resting the blame for the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on 9/11/01 on their political and moral enemies rather than the terrorists themselves.  Others simply repeat their remarks that gays, abortionists, the ACLU, and the People For the American Way should share in the blame for a spiritual vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place. "," According to the CBN website, the Interview took place on Thursday, September 13 (Some versions of the eRumor say it was Wednesday). Both men spoke harshly of the terrorists and clearly blamed them for the attacks. During a discussion about whether this crisis might bring revival to America, Jerry Falwell said God may have allowed what the nation deserved because of moral decay and said Americans should have an attitude of repentance before God and asking for God’s protection.  He specifically listed the ACLU, abortionists, feminists, gays, and the People For the American way as sharing in the blame.  Pat Robertson responded with agreement. APOLOGY The was national publicity over the Robertson-Falwell interview and strong reaction from representatives of some of the groups that Falwell named. On 9/14/01, Falwell issued an apology for his comments and said he believes that the terrorists alone were responsible for the attacks.  He reiterated, however, that theologically he believes that groups that have worked to secularize America have helped remove the nation from its spiritual foundations. Pat Robertson, on his website, distanced himself from the comments that he had agreed with at the time they were made.  He said that during the interview, Falwell suddenly made a “…political statement of blame directed at certain segments of the population that was severe and harsh in tone, and, frankly, not fully understood by the three hosts of The 700 Club who were watching Rev. Falwell on a monitor.”  Robertson said he considered the comments “totally inappropriate” and that critics had taken the words out of context. THE TRANSCRIPT Here are their comments in context: Pat Robertson began the interview asking Falwell what his response has been to the terrorist attacks.  Falwell said there had been a massive prayer gathering of members of his congregation along with students from Liberty University.  He told the TV audience that they had humbled themselves before God, prayed for President Bush and his advisers and for the victims of the attacks. Falwell then likened the attacks to Pearl Harbor and that at that time, Hitler wanted to destroy the Jews and conquer the world.  Now, “Islamic fundamentalists, radical terrorists, Middle-Eastern monsters” want to destroy Israel and conquer the world. The two men then talked about religious revival and whether the events of September 11 might spark spiritual renewal in America. Then Falwell said, “What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.” Robertson replied,  “Well, Jerry, that’s my feeling. I think we’ve just seen the antechamber to terror, we haven’t begun to see what they can do to the major population.” Falwell said, “The ACLU has got to take a lot of blame for this. And I know I’ll hear from them for this, but throwing God…successfully with the help of the federal court system…throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools, the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad…I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who try to secularize America…I point the finger in their face and say you helped this happen.” Robertson said, “I totally concur, and the problem is we’ve adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government, and so we’re responsible as a free society for what the top people do, and the top people, of course, is the court system.” Falwell added, “Pat, did you notice yesterday that the ACLU and all the Christ-haters, the People for the American Way, NOW, etc., were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress, as they went out on the steps and and called out to God in prayer and sang ‘God bless America’ and said, let the ACLU be hanged. In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time, calling on God.” ","Terrorism"

"500 Tons of Uranium Yellowcake Moved From Iraq to Canada-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/uraniumyellowcake/"," Various commentaries and news agency reports about radio active concentrates of uranium known as “yellowcake” being secretly transported from Iraq to a base in Canada. "," This eRumor started   circulating in August, 2008. “Yellowcake” (or “yellowcakes”) is a concentrate of uranium that results from the refinement of uranium ore.  It is used for making fuel for nuclear power plants and to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. On July 7, 2008 the American Forces Press Service released a statement of the completion of a classified mission dubbed “Operation McCall” to transfer 500 metric tons of yellowcake at the request of the Iraqi government from Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center near Baghdad to Canada. Click here to read the story posted on the Department of Defense site. According to published reports including CBS news, the United States secretly moved a huge stockpile of yellowcake over a two week period, from Iraq to Canada, partly to keep it from falling into the hands of either terrorists or foreign governments such as Iran. The operation was reportedly more than a year in the making and took three months to execute.  It included carrying 3,500 barrels of yellowcake by road from Baghdad, then flying them on 37 military flights to an atoll in the Indian Ocean, then carrying them aboard a U.S. ship bound for Montreal.  In all, it added up to more than 500 metric tons of material from Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program. The Iraqi government sold the yellowcake to a Canadian uranium company and it will be used in Ontario, Canada, for use in nuclear reactors. A CBS report said, “ And, in a symbolic way, the mission linked the current attempts to stabilize Iraq with some of the high-profile claims about Saddam’s weapons capabilities in the buildup to the 2003 invasion.  Accusations that Saddam had tried to purchase more yellowcake from the African nation of Niger – and an article by a former U.S. ambassador refuting the claims – led to a wide-ranging probe into Washington leaks that reached high into the Bush administration. “ The news report went on to say that the yellowcake “had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War.

"You can make millions by transferring some money for a foreigner-Scam!","2015-03-17 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nigeriascams/"," There are numerous versions of this eRumor and they are multiplying.  They all involve a request or an offer from a foreigner that millions of dollars be allowed to pass through your bank or account and as a thanks for your help, you will receive a commission, usually 10 to 25 percent.  These emails are initially were directed at businesses and business owners but now try to appeal to anyone and there are some that are offers of donations to churches and other non-profit organizations. Also, a variation of the Nigerian Advance Fee Scam is targeting people who have merchandise for sale on the Internet (see below). "," This is one of the most common scams on the Internet right now and one of the top issues that we we receive inquiries about at TruthOrFiction.com. We’ll describe the scam in detail, but very simply, it consists of someone convincing you that a lot of money or an expensive prize is within your reach. At the last minute, however, you will be asked to advance some money to clear one last hurdle.  After that, neither the scammers nor your money are seen again. There are literally hundreds of different versions of this scam using many different names for the originator so if you may not see here the particular message that you may have received.  The bottom line is the nature of the offer made These scammers also approach victims through the mail, fax, and by telephone. According to the Secret Service, it is a scheme that predates the Internet.  It has become known as “The Nigeria Advance Fee Scam.”  It is also known as “Four-One-Nine”, referring to the Nigerian law for fraud.  The majority of the messages initially claimed to be coming from people in Africa, especially Nigeria, but now the emails seem to be coming from every part of the globe. There are several different scenarios presented in the messages. The most common one tells you that there are millions of dollars sitting idle from a business deal, a government action, or an inheritance, and all you need to do is agree to let the money be run through your bank account or to help invest it in the U.S., and you’ll get a commission, usually in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Another version of the scam targets non-profit organizations such as churches and says that a wealthy African has died and left millions of dollars to your group.  At least one U.S. church lost $90,000 to an advance-fee-crook. Other emails claim to have unclaimed cash from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 or inheritance money from a victim of the Pentagon attack on the same day. TruthOrFiction.com has also received reports from readers who responded to job ads and then were offered large amounts of money from foreigners along with the promise that than can keep a cut of it. There are also a number of reports of strange emails from foreigners who offer to buy an item for sale on the Internet.  In response to your listing to sell an expensive item such as exercise equipment, a boat, car, or airplane, you receive an email (frequently in poor English) from someone who says confidently he wants to buy it.  He asks for more information and says that he’s got either a Fedex account that can be used to send the merchandise or that he has an agent, a shipper, or someone else in the United States who will arrange for the product to be picked up and shipped.  He may even offer to pay more than your asking price and may also offer to pay with a cashier’s check or money order.  What happens, however, is that when you receive his payment, it is for several hundred or several thousand dollars more than agreed.  He explains that it was a clerical error and apologizes and asks you to simply send the difference back to him in whatever form you prefer.  Or he says that is the extra mount of money needed by his agent to arrange for the shipping and he asks that you give it to the agent when he contacts you.  His check to you, however, was bogus, but looks so real that you don’t find that out for several days.  You’ve been scammed and you can kiss the money you sent to him or his agent goodbye. It didn’t take long after the end of the war in Iraq in 2003 for a version to appear that claims to be from the former accountant of a son of Saddam Hussein. The scammers have also personally approached various professionals saying they want to build something like a medical center, sports stadium, factory, or commercial building.  The professional is eventually asked to pitch in some funds to get the project over a hurdle, and it all disappears. Watch out for people who say you’ve won contests or lotteries that you never entered, have funds for you from a transaction that you never arranged, that you have won a prize but you need to pay for the shipping, or who say they need your credit card or other financial information in order to complete the transaction. There are hundreds of other variations on those themes and, according to the U.S. Secret Service, thousands of people who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  The Secret Service receives an average of 100 phone calls and 300 to 500 pieces of correspondence per day about the advance fee scams and says that in 2001, there were reports from 2,600 Americans who said they’d been scammed.  Sixteen of them lost more than $300,000.  Many people who’ve lost money don’t report it. In August, 2006, Fox news reported that a Nigerian Advance Fee scam may have been a part of the money troubles between Tennessee minister Matthew Winkler and his wife Mary, who is accused of killing Matthew, allegedly after a heated argument about finances. The Secret Service says the approaches of the scammers may include proposals of: Disbursement of money from wills Contract fraud (C.O.D. of goods or services) Purchase of real estate Conversion of hard currency Transfer of funds from over invoiced contracts Sale of crude oil at below market prices Returning lost luggage to you that had several hundred thousand dollars cash in it. Here’s an example of what happens: 1.  You receive a request from a foreigner with the prospect of millions of dollars coming your way. 2.  You reply and through a series of exchanges via email, fax, and phone, you are presented with documentation and convincing proofs of the identities and the credentials of the people you are dealing with. 3.  You are asked to provide information about yourself or your company including letterhead, Social Security and other identification. 4.  You may be asked to come see them in person in their country, or they may ask to come see you. 5.  Very often, some strings will be pulled on your behalf such illegally getting you into the country that is your destination. 6.  Once you are feeling good about the transaction and can taste the millions of dollars in your bank account, there is a sudden complication.  You are told that the money is secure and ready to be transferred, but that in order to get it released, a government official needs to be bribed or a fee needs to be paid.  You are given a last-minute request to advance thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to get rid of the unexpected glitch.  Or, in the worst cases, you may actually be trapped in a foreign country and will have to pay your way out.  The amount of money the scammers ask for is based on how much they’ve learned about your assets.  If they think they can get hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, that’s how much they’ll ask for.  If they know you can pay only a few thousand dollars, that’s how much they’ll ask for. 7.  You never see your money or the crooks again. One interesting note about the advance fee scams is that many of them admit that the money is stolen or the result of criminal activity such as overcharging companies who did business with the country.  That means that anyone who wants to get involved in the scheme has already agreed to participate in something that is “under the table”. That cuts down on the number of them who complain to authorities after it’s all over.  There are many wealthy individuals who would rather endure the loss of the money than to admit that they got scammed while participating in something slippery. The U.S. Secret Service says don’t respond to these communications but they’d like to hear from you if you’ve lost money to the scammers. CLICK HERE for the link. Updated 8/18/06 ","Terrorism"

Less than two hours after take off all contact with the plane.   Two passengers who were listed as being on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight turned up elsewhere and reported that their passports had been stolen. Responders in the air and on the sea have found an oil slick and some debris but these have not been connected with Flight MH370.   The plane is still missing and  conspiracy theories of a terrorist attack are flying on the World Wide Net. "," TruthOrFiction.Com is following this story and all allegations of foul play, terrorism or alien abduction.  We will post findings here as they develop.  So far, this remains a mystery. Update 03/24/14: Prime Minister Najib Razak said that Malaysia MH370 flight ended in Indian Ocean. The government in Malaysia said today that they have concluded that, “based on satellite data analysis from British company Inmarsat, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ended in the Indian Ocean, and no one on board survived.”  This according to a March 24, 2014 article by the U.K.’s Telegraph that said Prime Minister Najib Razak said that “Inmarsat engineers have been able to establish that the plane’s last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.”   Razak added, “This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.” Update 03/16/14: Investigators now believe that H370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan. According to a March 16, 2014 article by the Daily Mail in England, investigators now believe that the missing MH370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan.  The article said, “A Malaysian government official said people with significant flying experience could have turned off the flight’s communication devices. The representative said that hijacking theory was now ‘conclusive’, and, as a result, police have raided the luxury homes of both the captain and the co-pilot.” The pilot and co-pilot of the the 777 Zahari Ahmad Shah (photo left) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (photo right) “are now being investigated as police in Kuala Lumpur search for signs of foul play.” Background Loss of contact and sudden course change Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off on March 8 at 12:21AM (local time) from Kuala Lumpur and was expected to land in Beijing approximately 6:30AM.  The jet had reached an altitude of 35,000 feet when contact was lost with the plane at approximately 2:40AM. According to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today , the Malaysian military radar indicated that Flight 370 made a sharp turn and “flew at least as far as the Malacca Strait west of Malaysia.”    The article said, “Malaysian authorities have said the plane’s electronic signaling transponder apparently stopped working at about the time civilian flight controllers lost contact with it, near the coast of Vietnam.”  Malaysian Air Force Air Force chief General Rodzali Daud told reporters that military radar data showed  “the track of the plane then turning sharply and eventually flying over the island of Pulau Perak — hundreds of miles off course.” Responders in the air and on the sea are busy conducting search and rescue for the missing airliner but so far any debris or oil slicks found on the water have been determined not to be connected with the missing airliner.  This according to a March 9, 2014 article by USA Today. The Chinese Satellite Image Search planes were dispatched Thursday to conduct a search of an area where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  After a series of search patterns, spotters were unable to find anything.  This according to a March 13, 2014 article by CBS News. U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Flew On for Hours On March 13. 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that “Aviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. 777’s engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program.”    The article said that “investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted “with the intention of using it later for another purpose.” Course change On March 14, 2014 Reuters exclusively reported that “Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators.”    The article said that there are indications that the missing 777 was “either being flown by the pilots or someone with knowledge of those waypoints.” U.S. Military Believes 777 May have Crashed in Indian Ocean A March 13, 2014 news update by England’s Daily Mail reported that the “U.S. military say they believe missing Malaysian jet has crashed in the Indian Ocean and send navy vessel to the area.”   The article said, “U.S. destroyer USS Kidd is now reportedly being moved in to search the area, while Malaysia was due to ask for radar data from India and other neighbouring countries to see if they can trace the plane flying north west.” Stolen Passports used to board missing airliner According to a timeline in a March 10,2014 article by Britain’s Telegraph, Malaysian authorities are investigating the “identities of at least two other passengers in addition to two who were found to be using stolen passports.” Luigi Maraldi, shown on the left, whose name appeared on the passenger list, reported that his passport had been stolen.   Investigating the incident are the Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister along with their counterparts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Telegraph said, “Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is ‘examining additional suspect passports.'” In a later report , the Telegraph reported that “two men travelling on stolen passports on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that mysteriously disappeared on Saturday have been identified as Iranian nationals.”  The article said that the two Iranians “were travelling on passports belonging to Christian Kozel, an 30-year-old Austrian, and Luigi Maraldi, a 37-year-old Italian.” Two Iranian Nationals boarded the plane Security camera photos of the Iranian passengers using stolen passports were released on March 11.1. According to a March 11, 2014 article by Fox News , images “showed the two Iranian men boarding a plane at the same time. Interpol secretary general Ronald K. Noble said Tuesday the two men traveled to Malaysia on their Iranian passports, then apparently switched to the stolen Austrian and Italian documents.”   Noble added, that “recent information about the men made terrorism a less likely cause of the plane’s disappearance, but that did not allay concerns about the ease of travel involving stolen passports.” Cell phones of missing passengers still ringing A few family members of passengers of  the missing MH370 airliner said that  “dialing the numbers resulted in ringing tones on the other end, even though the calls weren’t picked up.”  This according to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today.    The families have encouraged the airline to search for the global positioning satellite (GPS) location of their loved ones’ mobile phones.  Experts in the cellular phone industry said  that a ringing phone is necessarily an indication that the calls went through.  Industry analyst Jeff Kagan told reporters, that the ringing is “just telling you that the network is in the process of finding and connecting to it.” Black hole theory shot down On March 19, 2014 CNN “anchor Don Lemon read a pair of tweets he received from viewers suggesting the plane’s disappearance could be the result of a “black hole,” Bermuda Triangle or an occurrence akin to the television series ‘Lost.'”  Lemon then pursued the possibility of a black hole encounter Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general, and said, “I know it’s preposterous, but is it preposterous, do you think, Mary?”  Schiavo agreed that it was preposterous and added,”a small black hole would suck in our entire universe. So we know it’s not that. The Bermuda Triangle is often weather, and ‘Lost’ is a TV show.” Click image to see video The example of the eRumor was an article posted on the FastCompany.Com website and was linked on the Drudge Report on March 10, 2014.

"," These claims have been tied up in a federal defamation lawsuit, and parties on both sides dispute each other’s claims. The eRumor started with a blog post on the Christian Action Network’s website. Founded by Martin Mawyer in 1990, the group says it’s a public advocate for “biblical principals, values, traditions and American ideals.” The blog appears under the headline, “America’s First Islamic Government,” and it describes the so-called town of Islamberg in Hancock, New York: “The Town of Islamberg is a bold attempt by an Islamic community,  located about 3 hours northwest of New York City, to set up its own  city-state with its own laws, its own government and even its own  military. The group behind the initiative is an organization called,  Muslims of the Americas (MOA). MOA has nearly three-dozen villages, camps and Islamic compounds  scattered around the United States, all of varying sizes and  population. But this camp in Hancock, which also serves as their  headquarters, is the first to be so brazen to set up its own Islamic  government.” The blog describes an oppressive and extremist environment in the community, details that were allegedly uncovered by an informant who spent eight years embedded there. That account was also included in Martin Mawyer’s book, Twilight in America: The Untold Story of Islamic Terrorist Camps Inside America .” TruthorFiction.com has confirmed that there is a Muslim community in Upstate New York. The rest of the eRumor’s claims, however, can’t be independently verified. It should also be noted that the community wasn’t referred to as “Islamberg” in any court documents or media accounts, so it’s unclear where that name came from. A number of claims made in “Twilight in America” and the Christian Action Network’s blog led the Muslims of America Inc. to file a lawsuit that sought $18 million in damages for defamation. According to court documents: “This is an action against Martin J. Mawyer, Christian Action  Network, and Patti A. Pierucci, defendants, for the malicious,  repetitious, and continuous, pronouncements and publication of  defamatory statements against Plaintiff. The provocative and  defamatory statements were included in the book: Twilight  in America: the Untold Story of Islamist Terrorist Training Camps in  America, authored by Martin J. Mawyer and Patti Pierucci, (October  2012), uttered by Mawyer on various media outlets including Fox News  (October 2012) and posted on CAN’s (Christian Action Network’s)  website www.Christianaction.org at various dates and times.” Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an attorney representing the Muslims of America, said the group’s residential communities are peaceful, the Washington Times reports : “The property upstate has farms; it has gardens; it has buildings  for work; it has little stores,” she said. “It’s a community of  families and of individuals who are just trying to get by day to  day.” Their common denominator is their faith, she said. “Everyone  believes in one God and the Prophet Mohammed as his messenger.” In court documents , lawyers for Muslims of America said the group was founded in the mid 1980s — a claim that would later prove to be a huge factor in the case. Lawyers also said the group bought 60 acres in rural Hancock, New York, to provide a “safe haven” for families that lived in the inner city. A Hancock town official told TruthorFiction.com that the property was not located in Hancock, but in the nearby town of Tompkins. The group also owns properties in Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Texas, Canada and Trinidad. The Washington Times reports : “The group said that it has always counseled members and residents  to abide by U.S. laws and avoid criminal, immoral and antisocial  behavior. The communities include doctors, engineers, nurses,  teachers, tradesmen, farmers and business people, with workshops,  seminars and interfaith outreach open to the public.” Lawyers for the Christian Action Network countered that the Muslims of America didn’t have legal standing to file a defamation suit. A federal judge agreed and dismissed the case. It turned out that the Muslims of America — as the group exists today — was legally established in January of 2013, after the book was published. A previous version of the group, the Muslims of Americas (plural) formed in the mid 1980s but dissolved in February of 2013 because its incorporation was “fraudulent as it identifies a fictitious board of trustees, signatures and dishonest notary attestation,” the Washington Post quotes from court documents : “’Cunning members’ who were Wahhabists ‘falsely presented  themselves’ and ‘created a Trojan horse by linking Muslims of  Americas legal status with the negative history of IM,’ IM being  Ikhwanul Muslimin (apparently meaning the Muslim Brotherhood).” Wahhabists are members of a strict Muslim sect founded by Abdul Wahhab in the 1700s. The sect is known for strict observance of the Koran and has historically been described as part of the Islamic reform movement. In the end, the federal judge dismissed the defamation lawsuit for procedural reasons, so the merits of the case were never fully argued in court. Representatives of the Christian Action Network maintain that their claims are accurate, and members of the Muslims of America maintain that they are the victims of defamation. That means this eRumor remains disputed for now. Future updates will be posted here. ","Terrorism"

"," It is true that Senators Diane Feinstein (D-California) and John Kyle (R-Arizona) are proposing legislation that they say would close some of the loopholes that may allow terrorists to enter the United States. This eRumor, however, leaves the impression that it singles out Iranians and completely bans Iranian student visas. One of the provisions Feinstein and Kyle want is a ban on student visas from several nations that are regarded as sponsoring terrorism, not just Iran.  The other nations are Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Syria, Cuba and North Korea.  Not only is the legislation not specifically targeted at Iran, but it does not completely end the opportunity for student visas.  According to Senator Feinstein’s website, “…the Secretary of State could waive the ban if the student passes an extensive background check and the Secretary certifies that the student would not pose a threat to national security.”  Feinstein says they do not want to end education opportunities for the students, but to enact laws that would ensure that terrorists are being distinguished from legitimate students.

"Department of Defense Procedures to Shut Up Civilians-Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dod-interment-resettlement-ops/"," This is a forwarded link to a video posted on YouTube that warns a manual for Interment and Resettlement Operations by U.S. Department of Defense.  The narrator on the video alleges that the operations will be used on citizens in the U.S. "," The manual appears to be real and was dated 12 February 2010 but it is what the narrator of the video calls “leaked.” We have no indication that it is a current policy of the Department of the Defense (DOD) or that the government has policies in place to incarcerate U.S. Civilians. This manual was found by reference number “FM 3-39.40” on an official military publications site .  That site requires a DOD approval certificate log, which we do not have at the time of this writing to authenticate the “leaked” copy with the official manual. Another unofficial copy of the manual was found posted on the Internet where anyone can download and read. Click to download manual. It is possible that the narrator is spinning a conspiracy theory that the government is out to get us from his interpretation of this manual.  The video’s allegations could be a misinterpretation of what is written in the manual because branches of the DOD are part of the logistical team that are used throughout the world when natural disasters strike. The preface of the manual states that the military police operations could be called in to assist in disaster relief efforts both nationally and abroad: Military police conduct I/R operations during offensive, defensive, stability, or civil support operations. I/R operations include military police support to U.S. military prisoner and detainee operations within operational environments (OEs), ranging from major combat operations to humanitarian-assistance missions in support of a host nation (HN) or civil agency. On page 14  the manual there is a flow chart that shows that “Displaced Civilians” (DC) come under resettlement operations and not classified as “Detainees.”   Yet, there is a classification for “Civilian Internees” (CI) who fall under the Detainee category.  In this context. an enemy combatant affiliated with a terrorist cell would come under the category of CI where the victim of a flood or earthquake whose home or city was destroyed could come under DC.  Under the heading of DC are included refugees, migrants, expellees, internally displaced persons, evacuees and stateless persons. Flow chart found on page 14 of the manual Civilian Internee (CI) is defined in the manual on page 17: 1-10. A CI is a civilian who is interned during armed conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power. (JP 3-63) CIs, unless they have committed acts for which they are considered unlawful combatants, generally qualify for protected status according to the GC, which also establishes procedures that must be observed when depriving such civilians of their liberty. CIs are to be accommodated separately from EPWs and persons deprived of liberty for any other reason. Displaced Civilian is not defined but the manual does describe how they should be treated on page 33: DISPLACED CIVILIAN HANDLING 2-10. Military police units may be required to support the collection and control of DCs. In offensive, defensive, and stability operations many of the fundamentals are similar to that of handling detainees, but the focus is typically different. The handling of DCs is also a mission that may be performed in support of disaster relief or other emergencies within the United States or U.S. territories during civil support operations. As such, local, state and federal agencies are primarily responsible for handling DCs with the U.S. military in a support role. When a state of emergency is declared, the state’s national guard may be called to assist with DCs under the control of the state governor or they may be federalized and conduct operations as federal U.S. military forces. (See Titles 10 and 32, U.S. Code [USC].) It is important to keep in mind that such a manual was designed to handle an unlimited number of possible scenarios where agencies under the  U.S. Department of Defense play a role. The video also alleges that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) would be involved.   In the event of a natural disaster in the U.S. these agencies would be involved.  FEMA provides the Incident Command System training for all US agencies involved in response missions.  FEMA comes under the blanket of the DHS. updated 03/12/13 ","Terrorism"

"Heinz Endowments to Leftist Causes through The Tides Foundation?-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/teresakerry/"," The eRumor says that Senator John Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, donates millions of dollars to The Tides Foundation. The eRumor says that the foundation supports various antiwar groups including one that offered to defend Saddam Hussein, another that seeks to ease restrictions on immigration from Muslin terrorist states, a group that has close relations with the terrorist group Hamas, and a radical Hispanic group that advocates returning all of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Arizona to Mexico. "," This story is a complex one and each side has its own explanation. It got started with a report in December of 2003 by the Capitol Research Center, a conservative watchdog group in Washington, DC. It was quoted in several newspapers including the Washington Times and the Wall Street Journal. The report was titled “The Tides Foundation…Liberal Crossroads of Money and Ideas.” It explored the founding of the organization and a companion group called the Tides Center and charged that they are used as channels for wealthy liberals to make donations to activist causes but without being tied directly to the activist organizations. The article didn’t focus on Teresa Heinz Kerry or the Heinz Endowments but did use Heinz donations as an example of what it was describing. It claimed that between 1999 and 2001 the Howard Heinz endowment, one of two of the Heinz endowments, donated $4,298,500 to the Tides Foundation or the Tides Center. There is no dispute that the Tides Foundation and Tides Center fund liberal groups. But supporters of Teresa Heinz Kerry say the Heinz Endowments donations have been for specific projects in Pennsylvania. They liken the Tides Foundation and Tides Center to the United Way through which donations can be given for a specific group or cause and don’t suggest that there is support for all the other United Way organizations. A statement by the Tides Foundation disputes the Capitol Research Center’s estimate of more than four million dollars in donations to Tides. It says that the Heinz Endowments have given only $230,000 to the Foundation and that was between 1994 and 1998 and used solely to support  a “pollution prevention initiative and other environmentally friendly practices by industries in Western Pennsylvania.” Confusingly, however, a document on the Heinz Endowments website itemizes its own donations to the Tides Foundation and the Tides center, which total $8,116,000 between 1994 and 2004. Both the Tides Foundation and the Heinz Endowments are headquartered in Pennsylvania. The president of the Heinz Endowments, Maxwell King, said that any of the articles that charged that donations were being secretly given to political activist groups are wrong. One of the contentions of the Capitol Research Center that some of the donations are “fungible,” meaning that they can be used for something other than the stated reason for the donation. In a response to an article about all this in the Washington Times in March, 2004, King said, “In fact, by contract, every penny of our support to Tides has been explicitly directed to specific projects in our region.  It cannot legally be redirected and is the exact opposite of ‘fungible.'” So the bottom line is that the Tides Foundation and the Tides Centers do provide grants to many left-wing activist organizations. The Heinz Endowments to make sizable donations to the Tides Foundation and the Tides Centers. But there is dispute over whether any of those Heinz donations find their way into some of the leftist causes that are mentioned in the eRumor. Heinz supporters say they do not and that the money donated has gone to specific community causes in Pennsylvania. Heinz critics say the Tides organizations exist, in part, to provide ways of making donations to activist groups in secret so the Heinz contributions should be scrutinized.

"Put an “ICE” entry in your cell phone for emergencies-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ice/"," The eRumor says that after the terrorist bombings in London in July, 2005, an ambulance service started a campaign to encourage you to put an “ICE” entry into your cell phone that contains the names and numbers of people to be contacted in case you are in an emergency. "," The campaign is true, although it was not prompted by the London terrorist bombings. It was started in April, 2005 by a paramedic based in Cambridge in England. His name is Bob Brotchie and he is a clinical team leader for the East Anglian Ambulance NHS Trust. He said he got tired of trying to figure out who to contact when dealing with shocked or injured patients who can’t give the information themselves. The campaign encourages people to put an entry in their cell phones and other portable address devices under the name of “ICE” (In case of emergency).  Emergency personnel can quickly check the cell phone for the ICE entry and reach  whoever’s name and contact information is there. It also gives the cell phone owner the opportunity to choose who will be contacted during an emergency when that person may not want Mom, Dad, or some other same-named relative to be called. The announcement of the campaign in April was made by Brotchie, a British war hero named Simon Weston, and the Vodafone Life Saver Awards. Vodafone is a cell provider in the UK and says that its research has shown that more than 75 percent of the people it surveyed don’t carry any information about who they would want contacted on their behalf in case of an emergency. In July, 2005, an email started circulating saying that an email about ICE should not be opened because it is a virus. There has not been a virus discovered using “ICE” as a subject message. The virus warning was a hoax, perhaps circulated by someone who was afraid that the email could be a virus. Last updated 7/25/05 ","Terrorism"

"A military draft in 2005?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/draft/"," The eRumor warns that there are two bills before Congress that, if passed, would bring back the military draft and make it mandatory for both boys and girls starting in June, 2005. "," The bills, S.89 and H.R.163 are real. But they are not new. An eRumor started circulating in June, 2004 warning that the draft was only a year away. In reality, these twin bills have existed since 2003 and have never gotten out of committees. In other words, they are stagnant. Nobody in Washington seriously expects a draft and certainly not by 2005. It’s known as the “reinstate draft” bill or the “Universal National Service Act of 2003.” The wording of the bill says it is “To provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.” It would require U.S. citizens and other residents, both male and female, between the ages of 18 and 26 to serve two years of “national service.” The reason the bills have gotten attention in 2004 is the military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the war on terrorism. There has been debate about troop strength in Iraq and the status of all the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Selective Service, however, says that despite the Internet stories, the agency is not getting ready to conduct a draft. It says it is ready to do so should the President and Congress decide, but “that responsibility has been ongoing since 1980 and is nothing new.” The Selective Service further says that “…both the President and the Secretary of Defense have stated on more than one occasion that there is no need for a draft for the War on Terrorism or any likely contingency, such as Iraq. Additionally, the Congress has not acted on any proposed legislation to reinstate a draft.” Last updated 6/18/04 ","Terrorism"

"," It is not true.  CNN has officially denied the claim.  Also, the person who originated the email has now said that his information was wrong and he no longer believes the story. It is true that there were Palestinians dancing in the streets and celebrating the terrorist attacks.  A spokesperson for CNN told TruthOrFiction.com that the footage they used was authentic and was taken shortly after the terrorist attacks. It is regarded as unethical among reputable news organizations to use film or video from one event and represent it as being from another event.  When footage is used from a time or place other than what is being reported, it is customary to indicate that for the viewer.  If it had been proven that CNN used 10-year-old pictures as though they were current, it would have been a major embarrassment. The eRumor got its start from a university student in Brazil.  He said that a teacher of his had videotapes from 1991 that proved that CNN had mislead its viewers and had complained to CNN and other news organizations about it.  The student was deluged with requests about the teacher’s claims so he contacted her outside of class about it and he says she denied having any videotapes.  She is quoted as having said only that she remembers seeing the footage in 1991, even though she told the class differently.

"Bush lied about weapons in Iraq?  What about the Democrats-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bushlied/"," Accusations that President Bush lied to the American people about whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are counterbalanced by quotes from prominent Democrats about Saddam Hussein and weapons in Iraq. Most of these statements were during the debate over whether to use force against Iraq. "," There are several quotes. Most of them come during a time in the Clinton administration when decisions were being made about action against Saddam Hussein and amid concerns about weapons of mass destruction. We’ll take them one at a time. “One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.” President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998- Truth! This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq. “If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program.” President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998- Truth! Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. His remarks followed that briefing. “Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.” Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998- Truth! This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton. “He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.” Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998- Truth! This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. “We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998- Truth! According to the U.S. Senate website, the text of this letter was signed by several Senators, both Democrat and Republican, including Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. “Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 – Truth! The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website. “Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.” Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999- Truth! This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago. She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country.  Albright said, “There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It’s just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies.” “There is no doubt that … Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 Truth! The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman. It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq. “We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.” Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002- Truth! These were remarks from Senator Levin to a Senate committee on that date. “We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! This and the quote below was part of prepared remarks for a speech in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club. “Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! “We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002- Truth! Part of a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins. “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons…” Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002- Truth! On the floor of the Senate during debate over the resolution that would authorize using force against Iraq. He was urging caution about going to war and commented that even though there was confidence about the weapons in Iraq, there had not been the need to take military action for a number of years and he asked why there would be the need at that point. “I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force– if necessary– to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002- Truth! Senator Kerry’s comments were made to the Senate as part of the same debate over the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein. “There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years … We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Rockefeller’s statements were a part of the debate over using force against Saddam Hussein. “He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do” Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Waxman’s contribution to the Senate debate over going to war. “In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members.  It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Clinton acknowledged the threat of Saddam Hussein but said she did not feel that using force at that time was a good option. “Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation … And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …” Sen.

"The “Triangle of Life” can save your life during an earthquake-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:39:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/triangle-of-life/"," An article from the pen of disaster rescuer Doug Copp.  He lists some of his observations from being on the scene after earthquakes and introduces what he calls “The Triangle of Life,” which he says can save lives during an earthquake.  He rejects the advice of traditional disaster experts and gives suggestions about what to do and where to be during an earthquake. "," Doug Copp claims, as the eRumor states, to lead the “world’s most experienced rescue team” and that he’s crawled into 875 buildings in 60 countries to find trapped victims of disasters. He argues that his experience has led him to conclude that the common suggestions of getting under a desk or standing in a doorway during an earthquake actually lead to more deaths.  Instead he lists several other suggestions such as simply rolling off a bed onto the floor if you are in bed or taking refuge next to a large sofa or chair when the earth starts moving. Copp’s tips are based on some of his own observations but on scientific research and there are disaster experts who disagree with him. The American Red Cross has written a response to Copp’s statements.  Ricky Lopes, manager of the American Red Cross’s Community Disaster Education, said Copp’s recommendations are “Inaccurate for application in the United States and inconsistent with information developed through earthquake research.” In a statement, Lopes said the American Red Cross’s recommendation is called “drop, cover, and hold on,” which includes getting under a heavy object such as a desk.  He said it is based on building codes in the United States and “has saved lives.” CLICK HERE for more from the American Red Cross. Dr. Marla Petal is director of the Bogazici University, Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute’s Disaster Preparedness Education Program in Turkey.  Her doctoral research was on the causes of death in the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake in Turkey, which killed more than 20,000 people.  She called the advice in the Doug Copp eRumor “plainly dangerous” and “worse than an urban legend.”   She said that there are indeed “triangles of life” in collapsed buildings where searchers look first for survivors—but that it is impossible to predict where those spaces will be.  She said, for example, that hiding next to a refrigerator or some other heavy object could be deadly because there is no way to anticipate which direction the object may move during a quake.  You could get crushed.  The same is true with automobiles.  She said that a strong earthquake will move and sometimes topple cars so simply getting out of the car and lying next to it does not create a dependable safety zone. Copp also found himself a center of controversy especially after a series of articles in 2004 by the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico.   Copp has claimed to have played a key role in rescue activities at Ground Zero in New York after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  He was granted more than $600,000 in compensation for what he said are injuries from the event, mostly toxicity.  The articles in the Albuquerque journal questioned both whether he played any important role at Ground Zero and whether he was eligible for any compensation for injury.  In a four-part series about Copp, the Journal quoted several people who saw Copp at Ground Zero as saying that he showed up with a video camera and did no serious rescue work.  The U.S. Justice Department fraud unit was investigating.

"," Reports surfaced in August 2014 that the terrorist group ISIS was targeting Pope Francis and planning an attack on the Vatican, but Vatican officials dismissed the so-called threats. II Tempo, an Italian newspaper, cited Israeli sources that said the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was targeting Pope Francis in an August 2014 report . The report said the number of jihadists in Italy was on the rise because of an increase in unidentified immigrants throughout the country. A Vatican official quickly dispelled reports that Pope Francis and the Vatican were targeted by ISIS. The Catholic News Agency reported that a Vatican official said, “There is nothing serious to this. There is no particular concern in the Vatican.

"," This eRumor appeared all over the Internet in November, 2011 and on various political web sites but it was not found on any major news sites. The email says only that is was authored by someone named Rich Carroll but does not identify him beyond that. Let us look some of the topics in the article one at a time: First President to refuse to show a valid birth certificate – Disputed ! Although there are those who dispute its validity, candidate Obama released  of his birth certificate in 2008 and it was displayed on his Fight the Smears web site when questions about his citizenship were raised.   Critics alleged that the document was a fake, or insufficient as proof for the office of the President. This stirred a frenzy of rumors including emails that contained faked documents including one made up to look like birth certificates from Kenya. Tow years later, in 2010, President Obama released what he said was his original long form birth certificate, from the state of Hawaii.. We have a page on the questionable citizenship of Barack Obama complete with photos of documents. Click for our findings. First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner- Fiction! This rumor originated from an April Fools Joke in 2009 featuring an alleged Associated Press story that said that Barack Obama received a grant from the “Fulbright Foundation” when he attended Occidental College in California.  There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. Click for our Findings First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in- Fiction! Rumors about Obama’s Social Security Number began circulating in 2010 alleging that the number belonged to a deceased man who immigrated to the U.S. from France and resided in Hawaii.   That proved to be fiction.   This sparked additional inquires as to why the President’s Social Security Number began with 042, the three digit classification for Connecticut.   According to the Social Security Administration, “The Area Number is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office.” Click for Social Security site First President to preside over a cut to the credit rating of the United States. – Truth! On August 5, 2011, for the first time in the history of this nation, Standard and Poor’s downgraded the US Credit Rating to one notch below AAA.  According to a Washington Post article dated that same day, “the credit rating company said ‘political brinkmanship’ in the debate over the debt had made the U.S. government’s ability to manage its finances ‘less stable, less effective and less predictable.’ It said the bipartisan agreement reached this week to find at least $2.1 trillion in budget savings ‘fell short’ of what was necessary to tame the nation’s debt over time and predicted that leaders would not be likely to achieve more savings in the future.” First President to violate the War Powers Act – Fiction! The War Powers Resolution of 1973 became federal law to prevent a president from committing the United States to an armed conflict without the approval from Congress. This law requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing  U.S. armed forces to military action.   It also limits U.S. involvement to no more than 60 days.  In 2011 President Obama bypassed congressional approval for going into Libya, but he was not the first U.S. President to do so. The War Powers Resolution was first disregarded by President Clinton in 1999, during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. – Truth! The President did order a moratorium on offshore drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet after the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. The moratorium was struck down by New Orleans Judge Martin Feldman and according to a February 3, 2011 article in Bloomberg the Obama Administration was acting in contempt by continuing the policy.  Felman’s comments on the ruling were reported in the article.  He said, “Each step the government took following the court’s imposition of a preliminary injunction showcases its defiance.”  Feldman added, “Such dismissive conduct, viewed in tandem with the re-imposition of a second blanket and substantively identical moratorium, and in light of the national importance of this case, provide this court with clear and convincing evidence of the government’s contempt.” First President to defy a Federal Judges court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.- Fiction! The constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been questioned by several courts in various states in the US since it was passed into law in March 21, 2010.  According to an August 12, 2011 article in Reuters a U.S. Appeals Court for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta ruled that it was unconstitutional to require all Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty but it unanimously reversed a lower court decision that threw out the entire law.

If the writer of the eRumor had in mind the Affordable Care Act then this would be Truth! .  When the law makers wrote the HR-3590 bill,  the Democratic majority House and Senate quickly passed it and the President signed it into law. It is doubtful that anybody in government who supported this bill actually read it,  Buried inside the 2409 pages of the “Obamacare” law there is a stipulation known as the “Individual Mandate,” where the Internal Revenue Service will collect a 2.5% penalty from tax returns not showing proof of enrollment of health insurance. First President to spend a trillion dollars on shovel-ready jobs and later admit there was no such thing as shovel-ready jobs.- Inaccurate! According to a September 26, 2011 article in Politico , President Obama did use the term “Shovel Ready Jobs” in a plan to fund $50 billion in improvements to highways, transit systems, railways and aviation. The idea was to put Americans back to work by construction upgrades to  150,000 miles of road, 4,000 miles of train tracks, 150 miles of airport runways and the nation’s air traffic control system. Political reported that experts did not see the jobs being as shovel ready as one would think as ” A tremendous amount of money and time is needed to get a project through a detailed design process, permitting, environmental hurdles, public hearings and land acquisition.” First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.- Under Investigation First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.

They now may be able to stay in the country. There are currently 300,000 deportation cases making their way through the federal immigration courts, but under the new policy immigrants classified as low-priority cases could be granted a stay and a chance to apply for a work permit.” First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to terminate Americas ability to put a man in space. Fiction! According to the St. Petersburg Times PolitiFact Check site, “Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of “first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space” — not Obama.”  The Apollo program ended in 1975 and had a five year gap in space launches until the Space Shuttle program was in full operation. First President to encourage racial discrimination and intimidation at polling places. – Unproven! On November 4, 2008 Black Panthers were spotted outside a polling place in Philadelphia, PA.  One of the Black Panthers was holding a night stick.   A YouTube Video taken by a local journalism student of an account with them went viral on the Internet and news outlets.  A short time later, police arrived on the scene and they were removed from the scene.  Charges of voter intimidation were charged but they were dropped by the Justice Department under the leadership of Eric Holder, according to an August 20, 2009  article in the Wall Street Journal.  No explanation was given by Holder or anyone at the Department of Justice.  The accusation that the President encouraged this incident remains unproven. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.- Truth!

There are no U.S. laws stating that a U.S. President or presidential candidate disclose his medical or educational background.   In his books, Barack Obama wrote about his life in Indonesia.  Questions about Obama’s travels could have been sparked by a  rumor that was spread on YouTube by Reverend James Manning of the ATLAH church in Harlem.  Manning alleged that Obama, while attending Columbia University (Class of 1983), was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to be the operative in an arms deal with the Taliban. Manning said that Obama was selected because he was fluent in Farsi and Middle Eastern customs.   President only speaks English fluently, has never learned Farsi and the Taliban did not exist until 1989.

In a  June 17, 2009 Human Events article, attributed to Niles Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative newspaper listed ten apologies by President Obama: 1 . Apology to Europe: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In America, there’s a failure to appreciate Europe‘s leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.” 2. Apology to the Muslim world: Interview with Al Arabiya, January 27. “My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.” 3. Apology to the Summit of the Americas: Address to the Summit of the Americas, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, April 17. “While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms.” 4. Apology at the G-20 Summit of World Leaders: News conference in London, April 2. “I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.” 5. Apology for the War on Terror: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight, that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.” 6. Apology for Guantanamo in France: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In dealing with terrorism, we can’t lose sight of our values and who we are. That’s why I closed Guantanamo. That’s why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogation practices. I don’t believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when you start sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.” 7. Apology for America before the Turkish Parliament: Speech to the Turkish Parliament, Ankara, Turkey, April 6. “The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.” 8. Apology for U.S. Policy toward the Americas: Editorial “Choosing a Better Future in the Americas,” April 16. “Too often, the United States has not pursued and sustained engagement with our neighbors. We have been too easily distracted by other priorities, and have failed to see that our own progress is tied directly to progress throughout the Americas.” 9. Apology for the Mistakes of the CIA: Remarks to CIA employees at Langley, Va., April 29. “Don’t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we’ve made some mistakes.” 10. Apology for Guantanamo: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America’s strongest currency in the world.” On the other hand, The FactChecker at the Washington Post said on February 22, 2011, that they “concluded that ‘the claim that Obama repeatedly has apologized for the United States is not borne out by the fact, especially if his full quotes are viewed in context.'”  They claim that the apology tour never happened.

I’m a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk. As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.” There was no mention in this speech that the Azaan was the most beautiful sound to Obama’s ears.

"," There’s no evidence to prove or disprove the claim that President Obama snapped at military brass during a briefing about airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. The email’s claims appear to have originated in a blog posted at the personal website of author DW Ulsterman. The blog post recounts the same claims at the eRumor without citing a source, so its claims cannot be proven or disproven. The eRumor’s claim that President Obama traveled to Camp David on September 19, 2014, is true, USA Today reports . But it’s not known, however, whether or not the president held an “informal briefing” with pentagon officials before his departure. The eRumor’s claim that military advisors had in some way tried to “paint all of Islam with the same brush” doesn’t appear to jibe with actual events. National Security Advisor Susan Rice said in a press briefing on September 19, 2014, that plans were to  “go on the offensive against ISIL” with coalition airstrikes and ground support provided by Iraqi Security Forces, Kurdish Security Forces and Syrian opposition forces. The military’s willingness to partner with those forces to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group contradicts the eRumor’s claim that all of Islam had been painted with the same brush.

"," It’s true that a former Marine was held for psychiatric evaluation after authorities were tipped-off about cryptic anti-government Facebook posts he made. The case doesn’t, however, prove that a larger crackdown on people who post anti-government comments on social media sites is underway. Police from Chesterfield, Virginia, detained former Marine Brandon Raub for a mental health evaluation on August 16, 2012. Police and FBI agents had been dispatched to Raub’s home to investigate a complaint that his Facebook posts had grown increasingly dark. Chesterfield Police said county mental health crisis intervention workers determined that Raub should be held under a temporary detention order and taken to a hospital for further evaluation based on his interactions with police. Raub was held in psychiatric care until a county judge ordered his release on August 23, 2012. In his ruling, the judge said Raub had suffered “a deprivation of liberty,” an NBC News affiliate reports . No criminal charges were filed in the case. In May 2013, attorneys for the Rutherford Institute, an organization that says it defends civil liberties, filed a civil lawsuit on Raub’s behalf. The lawsuit sought damages for alleged violations of Raub’s First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In March 2014, a federal judge dismissed the case and said mental health workers had acted reasonably in recommending Raub’s detention, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports . Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute appealed the decision in August 2014. The appeal says a former Marine who served with Raub in Iraq had tipped-off authorities about Raub’s Facebook posts. Some of the posts called for the arrests of President George W. Bush and President H.W. Bush and claimed that the U.S. government had orchestrated 9/11. Raub also talked about how revolution could lead to the former presidents’ demise. Another passage that drew attention stated, “Sharpen up my axe; I’m here to severe heads.” Raub later argued that the passage was intended to be “metaphorical” and said it was a song lyric. Authorities determined that Raub’s messages didn’t include specific threats of violence and didn’t rise to a criminal level. The eRumor’s claims about a larger ant-government crackdown may be based on “Operation Vigilant Eagle.” The FBI launched the program in April 2009 to target white supremacists and “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reports . FBI memos stated that the Vigilant Eagle program was designed to “share information regarding Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans whose involvement in white supremacy and/or militia sovereign citizen extremist groups poses a domestic terrorism threat.” However, the FBI didn’t detain Raub as part of Vigilant Eagle. Local authorities ordered Raub held for psychiatric evaluation based on his interactions with police, not based on his Facebook posts. Posted 10/31/14 ","Terrorism"

Tariq Farid denied the eRumor’s allegations directly in a blog post in which he said, “One of the unfortunate side effects of our digital age is that unfounded and hateful allegations can easily be spread to the public, even years after they have been dismissed as untrue. I have experienced this first hand due to the recent reappearance of old rumors by extremist bloggers regarding charitable contributions made through our non-profit organizations to worthwhile causes…” Fariq acknowledged that his foundation made a contribution to ICNA Relief USA, a New York-based subset of the Islamic Circle of North America, in 2011 to build housing for battered women.

"President Obama, Hillary Clinton Charged With Conspiring with Muslim Brotherhood-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-and-hillary-clinton-charged-with-conspiring-with-muslim-brotherhood/"," Egyptian lawmakers have charged President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with aiding terrorists for allegedly conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood. "," It’s not true that Egyptian officials charged President Obama and Hillary Clinton with aiding terrorists, or of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood. A number of private citizens in Egypt filed a flurry of lawsuits with the International Criminal Court (ICC) that named world leaders, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, in 2013. But those lawsuits were dismissed in 2014 because the citizens who filed them were not authorized to do so. The situation began to unfold in July of 2013 when former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and the country’s first Democratically elected president, was thrown from power and taken into military custody. Military officers suspended the country’s constitution and installed an interim government, the New York Times reports: “For Mr. Morsi, it was a bitter and ignominious end to a tumultuous  year of bruising political battles that ultimately alienated  millions of Egyptians. Having won a narrow victory, his critics say,  he broke his promises of an inclusive government and repeatedly  demonized his opposition as traitors. With the economy crumbling,  and with shortages of electricity and fuel, anger at the government  mounted. “The generals built their case for intervention in a carefully  orchestrated series of maneuvers, calling their actions an effort at  a ‘national reconciliation’ and refusing to call their takeover a  coup. At a televised news conference late on Wednesday night, Gen.  Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi said that the military had no interest in  politics and was ousting Mr. Morsi because he had failed to fulfill  ‘the hope for a national consensus.’” Mohamed Morsi was elected after former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down in 2011 after an 18-day revolt against his dictatorship. After Morsi was thrown from power and arrested in 2013, President Obama said in a statement : “The United States continues to believe firmly that the best  foundation for lasting stability in Egypt is a democratic  political order with participation from all sides and all political  parties — secular and religious, civilian and military. During  this uncertain period, we expect the military to ensure that the  rights of all Egyptian men and women are protected, including  the right to peaceful assembly, due process, and free and fair  trials in civilian courts. Moreover, the goal of any political  process should be a government that respects the rights of all  people, majority and minority; that institutionalizes the checks  and balances upon which democracy depends; and that places the  interests of the people above party or faction. The voices of all  those who have protested peacefully must be heard – including those  who welcomed today’s developments, and those who have supported  President Morsi. In the interim, I urge all sides to avoid violence  and come together to ensure the lasting restoration of Egypt’s  democracy.” The Muslim Brotherhood responded to Mohamed Morsi’s overthrow by filing suits with the ICC against Egypt’s army and interim government. The lawsuits accused them of “genocide against Egyptians.” Supporters of Morsi’s overthrow responded by filing lawsuits of their own with ICC. A number of the suits named members of the Muslim Brotherhood and world leaders like President Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Turkish prime minister. A professor of criminal law named Nabil Medhat Salem filed one of those lawsuits. The lawsuit, filed in August of 2013, named President Obama and members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Cairo Post reports : “Medhat has accused the Brotherhood leaders of deliberately killing  numerous citizens at Rabaa al – Adawiya and Nahda Squares, burning  mosques and churches, and he accused Obama of participating in these  violent acts through incitement and support.” It should be noted that Medhat is a private citizen, so reports that Egypt’s government filed the charges are false. The ICC dismissed the claims in 2014 because Medhat and other private citizens were not authorized to file the lawsuits: “A communication seeking to accept the jurisdiction of the  International Criminal Court over Egypt has been dismissed as not  presented on behalf of the concerned State. On 13 December 2013,  lawyers acting on behalf of, amongst others, the Freedom and Justice  Party lodged a communication with the ICC Registrar seeking to  accept the exercise of the ICC’s jurisdiction pursuant to article  12(3) of the Rome Statute with respect to alleged crimes committed  on the territory of the State of Egypt since 1 June 2013. “Upon receiving the communication, as per the established internal  procedures, the Registry verified with the Egyptian authorities  whether or not such a communication was transmitted on behalf of the  State of Egypt, as a result of which, the Registrar did not receive  a positive confirmation.” So, reports that President Obama and Hillary Clinton have been “charged” by the Egyptian government with conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood are not true. Private citizens did name Obama, Clinton and other world leaders in lawsuits — but the ICC later dismissed them. ","Terrorism"
"Obama Flashes Shahada Muslim Gang Sign-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-flashes-shahada-muslim-gang-sign/"," A photo shows President Obama flashing a Muslim gang sign called the “shahada” toward African leaders to show “affirmation” of his Islamic faith during a summit held in Washington, D.C. "," President Obama is not flashing a shahada Muslim gang sign in a photo taken at the U.S.-African Leaders Conference in Washington, D.C., in August of 2014. The photo, taken by an Associated Press photographer, shows President Obama pointing his right index finger as he smirks and nods at an African representative behind him. A video clip of the exchange, however, shows the president jokingly wagging his finger and chuckling as he walks by the representative before a photo op. As the eRumor claims, however, a single index finger extended on the right hand has been called the “tawhid”, and it is tied to the Shahada , a verbal profession of Islamic faith that goes, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.” Foreign Affairs reports that the gesture alludes to the first part of the shahada, a key component of the Muslim religion: “The tawhid comprises the first half of the shahada, which is an affirmation of faith, one of the five pillars of Islam, and a component of daily prayers: ‘There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.’” In photos , members of the ISIS terrorist group can often be seen raising an index finger, which has become known as “the jihadi equivalent of a gang sign,” Foreign Affairs reports : “…Gestures — in particular ISIS’ index finger — should demand far more attention. They are an important means by which regional groups communicate their core messages to viewers down the street and observers thousands of miles away in Europe and the United States. To understand the ideologies such groups aim to export, one needs to understand the symbols they use. “…For ISIS, the symbol is more sinister than a mere declaration of monotheistic beliefs. As Salafi jihadists, members of the group adhere to a fundamentalist interpretation of tawhid that rejects non-fundamentalist regimes as idolatrous. In other words, the concept of tawhid is central to ISIS’ violent and uncompromising posture toward its opponents, both in the Middle East and in the West.” ISIS’s use of the tawhid has been compared to the fascist salute used by Hitler and his supporters that conveyed the power of National Socialism, the obedience of crowds, and Hitler’s own power in one simple gesture. But even though ISIS has adopted the tawhid has as a “jihadi gang sign” of sorts, that doesn’t mean President Obama was captured displaying it at the U.S.-Africa summit in August of 2014. Extending the index finger is a common hand signal around the world, and video of the event appears to show the president jokingly wagging his finger at someone on stage with him. The eRumor started in mid-February of 2015 when the American Thinker published an article under the headline, “Obama and the Muslim Gang Sign.” A number of blogs quickly picked up on the story, and within days it had gone viral.

"Norway Targets Muslims for Deportation, Crime Rate Drops-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/norway-targets-muslims-for-deportation-crime-rate-drops/"," Norway’s crime rate dropped 31% after Muslims with radical ties were deported from the country. Christian countries are now deporting violent Muslims. "," It’s not true that Norway has specifically targeted Muslim extremists for deportation. Between 1995 and 2011, Norway’s immigrant population tripled so that 600,000 of the country’s 5 million citizens were immigrants or descendants of immigrants. That has led to a debate about integration, immigration policy, multiculturalism and national identity in the country, according to a Migration Policy Institute report. Since 2011, Norway has taken steps to reform certain aspects of its immigration laws, but the reforms were not specifically directed at Muslim immigrants. That claim appears to have first surfaced on the Political Ears website in November of 2014. The website reports that Prime Minister Erna Solberg launched a program that targets and deports Muslims with ties to radical groups: “While many in America would say this is racist, it’s worked in dramatic fashion. Violent crimes are down more than 31% in Norway. “What a shocker. “Perhaps the rest of Europe and the United States could learn a lesson or two about radical Islam here. Deport the radicals, keep the moderates, and everybody wins.” The eRumor incorrectly frames Norway’s immigration laws as a direct response to “radical Islam.” One of the main objectives of Norway’s immigration reforms has been to deport foreign citizens who are serving prison time there. The country has a limited number of prisons, and 30% of its prisoners were foreign citizens at one time. Most were from Poland, Lithuania, Nigeria, Iraq and Romania, the U.S. Library of Congress reports . The country has also cracked down on the number of new immigrants allowed into the country by denying more requests for asylum . Neither of those initiatives specifically targets Muslims, however. And it’s true that 824 unwanted individuals were deported from Norway in October of 2014, but it’s not true that all of them had ties to Muslim extremist groups, as the eRumor claims. In truth, less than one-third of Norway’s immigrants have come from predominately Muslim countries. As for the immigrants that have been deported, the Norway Post reports : “The Ministry of Justice has decided that 7,100 individuals are to be deported by the end of 2014. At the end of October the number of deportations was already at 5,867. “Many of the people who have been deported have been convicted of crime, or are individuals who have already been ordered to leave, but have returned to Norway illegally.” It should be noted that a terrorist attack on July 22, 2011, is often referenced in conversations about Norway’s national identity. A self-described right-wing Christian extremist named Andres Behring Breivik killed 77 people, including 69 young people at a Labor Party youth camp, CNN reports . ","Terrorism"

President Obama drew criticism for not taking part in citywide rallies that drew 3.7 million participants and 40 world leaders to Paris after the attack. The White House later said it had erred in not sending someone with a “higher profile” to the anti-terrorism rally. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said : “There is no doubt that the American people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in France as they face down this threat.” Still, the Obama Administration’s absence drew widespread criticism, including the “President Obama: It Was You” essay that was shared hundreds of thousands of times on social media and in forwarded emails. The essay begins, “President Obama: This is why you didn’t go to France,” and it lists 33 instances in which the president supported Islam, or turned a blind eye to Islamic jihad.

The claim went viral after the Royal Hashemite Court posted a picture of King Abdullah II decked out in full combat gear on its Facebook page on February 3, 2015. The post appeared with the caption, “His Majesty King Abdullah II, the Supreme Commander of Jordanian Armed Forces, cuts short his visit to the United States of America after the martyrdom of Muath Al Kasasbeh.” Muath Al Kasabeh was the Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State after prisoner-swap negotiations between Jordan and the Islamic state broke down. The Islamic State recorded Al Kasabeh’s execution and posted the video online. King Abdullah II cut short a trip to the U.S. to return to Jordan and said , “This evil can and should be defeated.” He added that he was “more determined than ever” to destroy the Islamic State. King Abdullah II’s strong response and the photo of him  in combat gear going viral led to speculation that King Abdullah II, a former Special Forces commander , would lead the counterattack against the Islamic State himself. The website Twitchy reports : “Lots of heads of states around the world have paid lip service to  fighting jihadists and standing against the monsters of ISIS. Yesterday, Jordan executed ISIS operatives and walked the talk of  counterterrorism…while President Obama posed for photos. Now comes word that Jordan’s King Abdullah is heading for the front  lines. Hard. Core.” That claim, however, appears to be false. The photo of King Abdullah II in combat gear was actually taken at a military training exercise in July of 2014, well before the Islamic State’s execution of Muath Al Kasabeh. And Al Arabia News reported that a government official had denied reports that King Abdullah II would personally take part in the attacks against the Islamic state. ","Terrorism"
"Hostage Kayla Mueller’s Death “Deserves No Tears” Because She Supported Terrorism – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hostage-kayla-muellers-death-deserves-no-tears-because-she-supported-terrorism/"," Kayla Mueller, the 26-year-old woman who died while being held hostage by the Islamic State terrorist group, “deserves no tears” because she supported terrorist groups. "," Kayla Mueller did not support terrorist groups, and the idea that her death “deserves no tears” is an incendiary claim that was designed to provoke a strong reaction. A family spokesperson said the Islamic State took Kayla Mueller captive outside a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, in August of 2013. The White House confirmed on February 10, 2015, that Mueller was killed while being held captive by the Islamic State, but the circumstances of her death are unknown. Mueller had worked with humanitarian organizations in India, Israel and the Palestine territories before she went to Turkey to aid Syrian refugees, according to the statement. Shortly after Kayla Mueller’s death, false claims that she had supported Palestinian terrorist groups began to appear in forwarded emails like this one: “The myth that this ISIS hostage was a wonderful altruistic young  woman is a lie. She was an anti-Israel activist and human shield for  Palestinian Terror Groups. Kayla Mueller was a member of the  International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who spent at least two years  working with that terrorist support group.” The International Solidarity Movement said that Kayla Mueller did volunteer with the group for two months in 2010. However, the email’s characterization of the ISM as terrorist group is false. According to the ISM’s website: “The International Solidarity Movement (ISM) is a Palestinian-led  movement committed to resisting the long-entrenched and systematic  oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian population, using  non-violent, direct-action methods and principles. Founded in August  2001, ISM aims to support and strengthen the Palestinian popular  resistance by being immediately alongside Palestinians in olive  groves, on school runs, at demonstrations, within villages being  attacked, by houses being demolished or where Palestinians are  subject to consistent harassment or attacks from soldiers and  settlers as well as numerous other situations. “Currently, ISM supports weekly Palestinian-led, non-violent  demonstrations against land confiscation in several villages,  including Nabi Saleh, Kufr Qaddum, Ni’lin and Bil’in. Previously,  ISM supported demonstrations in the villages of Budrus and Biddu,  where peaceful community marches have succeeded in altering the  Annexation Wall’s path.” ISM said that Mueller participated in a handful of nonviolent protests and accompanied children to school during her two-month stint with the group in 2010. Her involvement was kept under wraps during her captivity out of fear that it could jeopardize her safety. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s response to Kayla Mueller’s death is further proof that the chain email’s claims are false. Netanyahu said , “On behalf of the people of Israel, I wish to send condolences to President Obama, the American people and the family of Kayla Mueller. We stand with you.” After her two-month stint with the ISM in 2010, Mueller volunteered with numerous humanitarian organizations , including an HIV/AIDS clinic in Arizona. Her work with Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council brought her to the border of Turkey and Syria to help refugees in December of 2013. The chain email’s claim that Kayla Mueller “deserves no tears” because she spent two months volunteering with a nonviolent Palestinian group is baseless. ","Terrorism"
"Duke to Host Muslim Call To Prayer – Truth! & Resolved!","2015-03-17 20:38:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/duke-to-host-muslim-call-to-prayer/"," Duke University administrators announced plans to host a regular Muslim prayer at its chapel bell tower on Friday afternoons. "," It’s true Duke University announced a weekly call to prayer for Muslims at a chapel on campus, but the decision was amended days later due to controversy. The announcement was appeared on the website of Duke Today, a university publication, on January 13, 2015: DURHAM, NC – Members of the Duke Muslim Students Association will  chant a weekly call-to-prayer from the Duke Chapel bell tower  beginning Friday, Jan. 16. The chant, called the “adhan,” announces the start of the group’s  jummah prayer service, which takes place in the chapel basement each  Friday at 1 p.m. The service is open to the public. The chant lasts about three minutes and will be moderately  amplified. “The adhan is the call to prayer that brings Muslims back to their  purpose in life, which is to worship God and serves as a reminder to  serve our brothers and sisters in humanity,” said Imam Adeel Zeb,  Muslim chaplain at Duke. “The collective Muslim community is truly  grateful and excited about Duke’s intentionality toward religious  and cultural diversity.” Franklin Graham, son of the late televangelist Billy Graham, was vocal in his criticism of the Muslim call to prayer on his Facebook page : Duke University announced today that they will have a Muslim call to  prayer from their chapel bell tower every Friday. As Christianity is  being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are  raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who  doesn’t submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this  in the name of religious pluralism. I call on the donors and alumni  to withhold their support from Duke until this policy is reversed. Others joined Graham in rallying against the call to prayer, and the university’s Facebook page was inundated with vocal opposition from other Christians. Graham then posted a second message about the prayer: The Muslim call to prayer that has been approved to go out across  the campus of Duke University every Friday afternoon for three  minutes includes “Allahu Akbar”—the words that  the terrorists shouted at the onset of last week’s massacre in  Paris. It includes the proclamation that there is no god but Allah  and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Will evangelical  Christians be allowed the same three minutes weekly to broadcast the  message across campus that God Almighty of the Bible sent His Son  Jesus Christ to offer forgiveness of sins and salvation to all who  will repent, believe, and call on His Name? Jesus said, “I am the  way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except  through Me” (John 14:6). In the face of strong opposition, Duke officials released a second statement on January 15, 2015, that explained that the university had decided to hold the Muslim call-to-prayer chant outside the chapel bell tower: Duke University has reconsidered a previously announced plan to  present a traditional Muslim call-to-prayer from the Duke Chapel  bell tower, campus officials said Thursday. The call to prayer, or “adhan,” which announces the start of a  weekly jummah prayer service that has been held in the Chapel  basement for the past several years, will not come from the bell  tower on Friday as announced earlier. “Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and  welcoming campus for all of its students,” said Michael Schoenfeld,  vice president for public affairs and government relations.  “However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify  was not having the intended effect.” Jummah prayers have taken place in the basement of Duke Chapel for  many years, and start with the traditional call to prayer chant.  Members of the Muslim community will now gather for the  call-to-prayer chant on the quadrangle outside the Chapel, a site of  frequent interfaith programs and activities, before moving to  its regular location for prayers. More than 700 of Duke’s 15,000  undergraduate and graduate students identify as Muslim. “Our Muslim community enriches the university in countless ways,”  said Schoenfeld. “We welcome the active expression of their faith  tradition, and all others, in ways that are meaningful and visible.” Duke has Christian ties that date back to its founding in 1924. The university was founded around the Methodist-affiliated Trinity College and was known as Trinity-Duke in its early years. The book, “ The Launching of Duke University ,” provides a detailed account: Initially, Duke followed the long-established, Methodist-sanctioned  policy that Trinity had scrupulously observed: no dancing on campus.  Off the campus and with approved arrangements concerning loation,  hours and chaperones, university officials shut their eyes about  what many churchgoers still regarded as a serious social vice. Today, Duke’s bylaws state that its aim is to “assert faith in the eternal union of knowledge and religion set forth in the teachings and character of Jesus Christ.” But Michael Schoenfeld, vice president of public affairs and government relations at Duke, said Duke is an independent and non-sectarian institution with ties to the church that are primarily historical and symbolic. Schoenfeld made the comment after a court decision threatened the ability of campus police to patrol religious institutions in 2010. ","Terrorism"

It also suggests that in May of 2001, there was a successful       grass-roots effort to drive down gas prices by boycotting certain       companies. "," There are several issues in this eRumor. First, does the purchase of Middle Eastern oil help terrorism. There are varying voices on that. Some say that since Osama Bin Laden’s family made its money mostly from construction and that Bin Laden has been estranged from the family for quite a while, there isn’t any direct link. Others say that oil purchased from countries like Iraq goes directly toward support of terrorism and that profits for other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, indirectly aid terrorism because of wealthy Saudis who are said to help finance people like Osama Bin Laden. Second, what oil companies buy Middle Eastern oil? We were able to secure the statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy for various oil companies for calendar Year 2000: Shell purchased 3,611,000 barrels from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia BP purchased none from the Middle East. Chevron purchased 14,724,000 from the Middle East. Citgo-None from the Middle East. Amoco purchased 3,611,000 barrels from the Middle East. Exxon-Mobil combined purchased 13,273,000 barrels from the Middle East. Marathon purchased 10,710,000 in Middle Eastern oil. Sunoco purchased none from the Middle East. Conoco purchased 523,000 from the Middle East. Sinclair-We didn’t find any figures. Phillips-We didn’t find any Middle Eastern purchases. Third, was there a successful boycott in 2001? Not really.

Penney said she had been stationed for only a short time as a training officer at Andrews Air Force Base when she and her fellow pilots got the word that terrorists had commandeered commercial aircraft in a planned attack that targeted the Pentagon, a second undetermined site in Washington D.C. and the World Trade Center in New York City. When it was discovered that United Airlines Flight 93 was on a course toward Washington D.C. she said that she and another pilot, Col.

No weapons had been loaded on the F-16’s that Penney and Sasseville  were piloting other than some rounds of blanks for training on the plane’s guns.  She and Sasseville realized that time was of the essence and began to taxi to the runway as ground crew pulled the safety pins from the landing gears and removed the tire chocks that prevented their jets from rolling on the tarmac.    The two pilots also bypassed a safety check list that would have eaten up 30 minutes so they could be in the air in a matter of minutes to make visual contact and intercept the hijacked passenger jet.  In case they had to, Penney and Sasseville were prepared to ram Flight 93 with their own fighters.  The two pilots had discussed this plan with each other as they were getting into their flight gear.  Penney had planned to take out the tail section of the airliner to minimize collateral damage on the ground while Sasseville rammed the cockpit` with his fighter jet. While on their mission to sanitize the airspace from threats the two fighter pilots were sweeping the area looking for Flight 93 when they heard that it had crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, not far from Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   By this time, U.S. Airspace was declared a no fly zone and all non military planes were grounded. The Air National Guard pilots began a new task of escorting planes in the air back to airfields.  Later that day, Lt. Penney escorted Air Force One with President George W. Bush inside back to Andrews Air Force Base. Heather Penney is now a Major in the Air National Guard and she was recently interviewed about the drama in the skies after she and other fighter pilots scrambled to respond to the attack on America.

"Sarah Palin National Guard Commander-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/palin-national-guard/"," The eRumor highlights Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s National Guard duties saying that she is briefed on highly classified issues, Homeland Security and counterterrorism.   It also says that she is the commander of the Alaska National Guard and the commander in chief of the Alaskan State Defense Force. "," A local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) public affairs representative in Los Angeles told TruthorFiction.com that elected government officials go through a security screening process but could not go into details as to the level of investigation or the security level given to any one official in particular. We have asked both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for further information on the level of security for governors. The Los Angeles Times on September 6, 2008 reported that Governor Sarah Palin oversees military units whose duties include serving overseas as well as search-and-rescue (SAR) missions at Ft. Greely. The LA Times article went on to say that the Alaska Air National Guard is 1,946 service member strong and has participated in several search-and-rescue missions. Since Palin’s election in 2006 the Air Guard has flown 521 missions, saving 200 lives and assisting with the rescue of 77 more people.   The foreign deployments of units and the operation of missile interceptors are not the responsibility of state governors. That comes down from the regular U.S. military chain of command. Ft. Greely is located about 100 miles South East of Fairbanks, Alaska.  In 1995 the base was slated for realignment by 2001 in but still remains open as a facility for  Alaska National Guard, COLD REGIONS TEST CENTER (CRTC), Missle Defense Agency (MDA) and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC). The Alaska State Defense Force (ASDF) is a military police organization that was primarily created as a back up for the National Guard.  According to their web site they work with primarily “State and local emergency management agencies in Homeland Security, disaster assistance, planning, exercises, and operations in response and recovery for both natural and man-made disasters.” The mission statement on their website states, “The Mission of the 49th Military Police Brigade is to maintain an organized and trained military force, capable of timely and effective response to State emergencies, or on occasions deemed appropriate by the Governor, to provide military assistance to civil and military authorities for Homeland Security and in the preservation of life, property, and public safety.” Governor Palin would only call upon them in case of an emergency. Click here for the A.S.D.F. web site. It is not uncommon, in the event of an emergency, for a state governor to use military resources like the National Guard.   California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently had to use the California National Guard to help battle wild fires.  Earlier this year, the US Coast Guard in San Pedro, CA and the US Marines at Camp Pendleton assisted local agencies in the transport of volunteers, firefighters and equipment to Avalon when the Island of Catalina was threatened by fires.  After the devastation from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 the US Coast Guard and the National Guard worked with local agencies in rescuing stranded residents from flooded areas. updated 09/08/08 ","Terrorism"
"Barack Obama and William Ayers-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-ayers/"," An eRumor claiming that Senator Barack Obama had a long association with a known domestic terrorist by the name of William Ayers who took part in the bombing of the Pentagon "," Ayers was a founding member of a radical group known at the Weather Underground that carried out bombings of federal buildings including the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s. It was in protest of the Vietnam war. Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohm spent a decade as fugitives from the FBI, which classed the Weather Underground as a “domestic terrorist group.” They resurfaced in 1980 after charges against them were dropped because of misconduct in collecting evidence against them. They both became professors in Chicago where Ayers was an education professor at the time that he became a campaign controversy in 2008. Ayers has been unrepentant about his Weather Underground activities and has been quoted as saying they “didn’t do enough.” The nature of Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers was a subject talked about among his critics during the 2008 presidential campaign, but it became a major issue when Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin brought it to the campaign trail in a speech in California on October 4, 2008. She said, “”Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country.” Supporters of Obama said that contact between the two men was not that significant and pointed to a New York Times story that said their relationship consisted of attending board meetings of two Chicago organizations they were involved with and other than that, there had been no contact between them except bumping into each other on the sidewalk in the neighborhood in which they both lived. Obama’s “Fight the Smears” web site called the accusations about the Obama-Ayers connection “phony, tenuous, and exaggerated at best, if not outright false.” The Obama site accused his critics of trying to link him with terrorism or approving of terrorism. Critics said a special investigations unit composed of Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston from CNN looked into the Ayers story and concluded that “the relationship between Obama and Ayers went deeper, ran longer and was more political than Obama — and his surrogates.” The CNN story said    that: A review of      board minutes and records by CNN show Obama, crossed      paths repeatedly with Ayers at board meetings of the      Annenberg Challenge Project in Chicago. For seven      years, Ayers and Obama — among many others —      worked on funding for education projects, including      some projects advocated by Ayers. While working      on the Annenberg project, Obama and Ayers also      served together on a second charitable foundation,      the Woods Fund, and that among the Woods Fund      recipients was the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s Trinity      United Church where Obama had his church membership. Obama praised Ayers’ book on the     subject of juvenile justice in a 1997 Chicago Tribune     review, calling it “a searing and timely account of the     juvenile court system, and the courageous individuals     who rescue hope from despair. On a September 23, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an article written by Stanley Kurtz called “Obama and Ayers Pushed Radicalism On Schools. ”   In it Kurtz claims that Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers is more than that of just having served together on the board of the educational non profit organization Chicago Annenberg Challenge (CAC) and that “Barack Obama’s first run for the Illinois State Senate was launched at a 1995 gathering at Mr. Ayers’s home.” According to the article, “in early 1995, Mr. Obama was appointed the first chairman of the board, which handled fiscal matters. Mr. Ayers co-chaired the foundation’s other key body, the ‘Collaborative,’ which shaped education policy.”   Kurtz raised a question in this article as to how “a former community organizer fresh out of law school, could vault to the top of a new foundation?”   Even though the Obama campaign had issued a statement denying Ayres recruitment of Obama, Kurtz observed that  “Mr. Ayers founded CAC and was its guiding spirit. No one would have been appointed the CAC chairman without his approval.” The New York Times published an article by Scott Shane about the Senator’s relationship with Ayers on October 3, 2008 called “Obama and ’60s Bomber: A Look Into Crossed Paths.”   In it, Shane wrote, “Their paths have crossed sporadically since then, at a coffee Mr. Ayers hosted for Mr. Obama’s first run for office, on the schools project and a charitable board, and in casual encounters as Hyde Park neighbors.” Shane talked to Obama Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt,  who told him “they have not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages since Mr. Obama began serving in the United States Senate in January 2005 and last met more than a year ago when they bumped into each other on the street in Hyde Park.” Click for Wall Street Journal Kurtz article Click for New York Time Article Click for Obama’s Fight the Smears statement CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama updated 10/08/08 ","Terrorism"
"Obama Lies?-Truth!, Fiction!, and Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-lies/"," A lengthy email represented as lies told by Senator Barack Obama. "," This is a list of alleged “lies” by presidential candidate Barack Obama that circulated during the 2008 presidential primary season. There were several different versions, the first having only about 25 criticisms of Obama and instead of calling him a “liar” it ended each claim with the phrase “Not quite.”  Then it was 46 questions and a version circulated that added four more to make it 50 lies. It was a very difficult and tedious process to research this.   Whoever put it together did not document where Obama made these statements and many of them could not be found. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. ( CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama ) Let’s deal with them one at a time. LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born – LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 – Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google ‘Obama Selma’ for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)- Truth! This refers to a speech Obama gave and when he did get the dates of his birth and the events at Selma backwards. It was in 2007 at a celebration of the famous Selma-to- Montgomery Voting Rights March in Alabama that took place in March, 1965. At one point in the speech, Obama described how that was the environment in which his father came to the United States and met his mother.  Then he said, “There was something stirring across the country because of what happened in Selma, Alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge. So they got together and Barack Obama Jr. was born. So don’t tell me I don’t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don’t tell me I’m not coming home to Selma, Alabama.” The Selma Voting Rights March was in March, 1965.  Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 so he was not born in the shadow of what happened in Selma. 2.) Father Was A Goat Herder – LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government- Truth! & Fiction! It is true that Obama’s father became well-educated and had the advantage in his early life of having learned to read and write. It is also true, however, that he herded goats.  In his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, Obama describes that his father herded goats for his own father, who was a farmer.  As a youth, Obama’s father was sent to a missionary school to be educated.  When he returned, according to family members, he could find little work except goat herding in his village of Nyangoma Kogela in Western Kenya. 3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter – LIAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had- Unproven! We could not find this claim that Obama represented his father as a “proud freedom fighter.” 4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom – LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya .. It is the first widespread violence in decades- Unproven! & Truth! Again, we could not find where Obama said that his family has strong ties to African Freedom. Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya who ran for president in 2007 and challenged the election results when he lost.  The resulting violence killed hundreds and left thousands homeless.  Odinga has claimed to be Obama’s cousin but Obama has never acknowledged that and no proof of the connection has been offered. 5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian – LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. Not to mention, Christianity wouldn’t allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man- Fiction! We could not find a time when Obama claimed that his grandmother had always been a Christian. If he did, the writer of this email described a Moslem woman, which would be Obama’s grandmother on his father’s side.  In a speech in 2007, Obama described his maternal grandparents as “nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists.” 6.) My Name is African Swahili – LIAR, your name is Arabic and ‘Baraka’ (from which Barack came) means ‘blessed’ in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama- Fiction! & Truth! There has been a lot of discussion about this one with some people connecting the name to Arabic words, others to Hebrew, and others to Swahili.  Regardless, the name “Barack” or “Barak” is found among Africans and “Barak” is a Swahili word meaning blessing or prosperity.  There are also related Arabic words such as “baaraka,” which relates to blessing and most agree that the name is derived from Arabic.  Obama has cited both origins of the name.  In his book Dreams From My Father , Obama describes the name in this way:  ““It means ‘Blessed.’ In Arabic. My grandfather was a Muslim.”  He has also described his first name as Swahili. Barack Hussein Obama is not half black. If elected, he would be the first Arab-American President, not the first black President. Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother’s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father’s side. While Barack Hussein Obama’s father was from Kenya , his father’s family was mainly Arabs. Barack Hussein Obama’s father was only 12.5% African Negro and 87.5% Arab (his father’s birth certificate even states he’s Arab, not African Negro). From….and for more….go to….. http://www.arcadeathome.com/newsboy.phtml?Barack_Hussein_Obama_-_Arab-American,_only_6.25%25_African- Fiction! There is no evidence that any of this is true.  The link provided for documentation is from a user forum on a game site, hardly a reliable source. Obama’s father’s family is overwhelmingly African.  According to an overview of published genealogies of Barack Obama:  His father was Barack Obama.  His grandfather was Onyango Obama, a Kenyen who converted to Islam.  His great grandfather was simply known as Obama of Kendu Bay, Kenya.  His second great grandfather was named Obiyo.  His third great grandfather was named Okoth.  His fourth great grandfather was named Obongo.  His fifth great grandfather was named Otondi.  His sixth great grandfather was named Ogelo.  His seventh great grandfather was named Ogelo. 7.) I Never Practiced Islam – LIAR, you practiced it daily at school, where you were registered as a Muslim and kept that faith for 31 years, until your wife made you change, so you could run for office- Mostly Fiction! As a child, Obama attended both Islamic and Christian schools.  In the Islamic school there was education about Islam faith and practice as there was in the Christian school.  There is no evidence that as an adult Obama has ever practiced Islam. We have dealt with this in detail in a story about Obama’s faith. CLICK HERE for that story. 8.) My School In Indonesia Was Christian – LIAR, you were registered as Muslim there and got in trouble in Koranic Studies for making faces (check your own book)- Truth! & Fiction! In his book Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of attending both the Islamic and the Christian schools in Indonesia during his childhood. He does describe that one of the teachers from the Islamic school “wrote to tell my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies.” The Associated Press reported on 1/24/08 that when his family moved to Indonesia when he was a child, “At first, Obama attended the Catholic school, Fransiskus Assisis, where documents showed he enrolled as a Muslim, the religion of his stepfather. The document required that each student choose one of five state-sanctioned religions when registering – Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic or Protestant.” 9.) I Was Fluent In Indonesian – LIAR, not one teacher says you could speak the language- Fiction! We’ve not found any record of Obama claiming to be fluent in any Indonesian language.  He is said to speak a little Bahasa, the national language of Indonesia. 10.) Because I Lived In Indonesia , I Have More Foreign Experience – LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn’t even speak the language. What did you learn, how to study the Koran and watch cartoons- Fiction! Again, we have not found any occasion when Obama claimed that his childhood in Indonesia qualified him as having “more foreign experience.” 11.) I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs – LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies- Opinion! & Fiction! As a presidential candidate, Obama certainly argues that he is qualified to deal with foreign policy, but whether that is true or not depends on the observer and is a matter of opinion.  His travels have included more than Africa and the Middle East, however.  He was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and served on several subcommittees.   He was described by his critics as the most traveled freshman Senator.  His travels have included Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan in Asia, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, the Palestinian Territories, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. 12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion – LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify – your classmates said you were just fine- Partly Truth! Obama’s autobiography deals extensively with his experience growing up as an African-American and the issues that presented him.  His drug use, he says, was “…something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind, something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory.”  In October, 2006, he told a New York Times reporter that his drug use was “…reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teenage boy.  Teenage boys are frequently confused.” 13.)An Ebony Article Moved Me To Run For Office – LIAR, Ebony has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Fiction! We have not found any reference in either of his books of an Ebony article that influenced Obama’s decision to run for office. 14.) A Life Magazine Article Changed My Outlook On Life – LIAR, Life has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Truth! & Fiction! In Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of seeing a picture in Life Magazine of a black man who tried to peel off his skin.  It happened at a time when he was being told by his mother about bigotry and when he was looking at himself in the mirror and wondering if there was something wrong with him.  “I imagine other black children, then and now, undergoing similar moments of revelation,” he wrote. “I know that seeing that article was violent for me, an ambush attack.” We have not found documentation that “Life has yet to find the article.” 15.) I Won’t Run On A National Ticket In ’08 – LIAR, here you are, despite saying, live on TV, that you would not have enough experience by then, and you are all about having experience first- Truth! After his Senate victory in 2004 he ruled out a national run owing to his lack of experience. Click for the YouTube video 16.) Present Votes Are Common In Illinois – LIAR, they are common for YOU, but not many others have 130 NO VOTES- Mostly Truth! This is with reference to criticism of Obama for having voted “present” 130 times during his service in the Illinois legislature instead of “yes” or “no.”   The “present” vote is, in fact, common in the Illinois state legislature and is sometimes at the request of the legislative leaders.  When legislators vote, they use buttons on their desks that register their choices electronically.  A red button is for “no,” a green button is for “yes,” and a yellow button is for “present.” 17.) Oops, I Misvoted – LIAR, only when caught by church groups and democrats, did you beg to change your misvote. We’re not sure what this was regarding. 18.) I Was A Professor Of Law – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Fiction! The University of Chicago Law School has issued a statement on this: “From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School’s Senior Lecturers has high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined.” 19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Unclear! We didn’t find this as a claim of Obama’s but if he did, he may have been referring to his time as a Civil Rights lawyer in Chicago. 20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill – LIAR, you didn’t write it, introduce it, change it, or create it- Fiction! It depends on what the writer of this email was referring to.  We haven’t found a quote that said “Without me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill.”  As an Illinois State Senator, Obama did help pass a major ethics reform bill.  The 110th U.S. Congress passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability act, which drew from provisions in a bill that Senators Obama and Feingold had originally introduced. 21.) The Ethics Bill Was Hard To Pass – LIAR, it took just 14 days from start to finish – Unproven! We could not find when he said this. 22.) I Wrote A Tough Nuclear Bill – LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation – mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came- Truth! Obama has talked of nuclear legislation he pushed in the Illinois legislature.  At a presidential campaign appearance in Iowa in December, 2007, the New York Times quoted him as having said it was “the only nuclear legislation that I’ve passed.”  In reality, the bill never did pass.  It died in the Illinois Senate. According to the New York Times, at issue was the concern of citizens about unreported low-level radioactive leaks at nuclear plants.  On the other side was Exelon, the largest nuclear plant operator in the nation and one of the largest campaign contributors to Obama. 23.) I Have Released My State Records – LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within- Fiction! We haven’t found the quote “I have released my state records.”  On November 14, 2007, an Associated Press article quoted Obama as saying, “I don’t have — I don’t maintain — a file of eight years of work in the state Senate because I didn’t have the resources available to maintain those kinds of records.”  Records of state bills and the votes of senators, however, are available from the Illinois state legislature. 24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess – LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens . You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books- Truth! & Fiction! In his book, Obama goes into detail about his work as a community organizer and the role that he played in the troubled Altgeld Gardens housing project in Chicago.  It was home for 5,300 African Americans who lived with concerns that they felt the city had not been responsive to.  Among them were a nearby landfill and a sewage treatment plant.  One of the goals was to get the city to remove asbestos from the apartments.  Obama does focus on his role as the organizer. 25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America – LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill. We’re not sure what this is referring to or what bill included 111 Obama economic policies.  Also, we have not been able to find this exact quote from Obama. 26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois – LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part. We have not found this exact quote from Obama and the conclusion calls for opinion. 27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year – LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office- Truth! We haven’t found the quote “I passed 26 of my own bills in one year.”  It is true that he passed 26 bills in his final year as a state senator. It is also true that he was handed those bills by senate majority leader Emil Jones, Jr., a veteran Democrat who was black, who represented Chicago’s south side, and is credited with having thrust Obama into prominence. 28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA – LIAR, the Canadian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them- Disputed! This arises from an issue in the primary campaign that became known as “NAFTA-Gate” and included a volley of charges between the campaigns of Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Obama. During a debate in Cleveland, Ohio in February, 2008, Obama said that he would renegotiate the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico or else opt out of it.  The next day after the debate, the Canadian Television Network (CTV) ran a story that said that an Obama staff member called Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. to alert him about what Obama was going to say and to not take it seriously. The Obama campaign and the Canadian embassy both issued statements denying that any such phone call had taken place. Then CTV reported that the conversation about NAFTA may have taken place in a Chicago meeting with Canadian officials that included Austan Goolsbee, the senior economic adviser to the Obama campaign and an economics professor at the University of Chicago. On 3/3/08 The Associated Press reported on a memo that it said had been “widely distributed” in the Canadian government that described the meeting as having taken place in February.  The memo said that Goolsbee “was frank in saying that the primary campaign has been necessarily domestically focused, particularly in the Midwest, and that much of the rhetoric that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy. On NAFTA, Goolsbee suggested, according to the report, that Obama is less about fundamentally changing the agreement and more in favor of strengthening/clarifying language on labor mobility and environment and trying to establish these as more `core’ principles of the agreement.”  In the same Associated Press article Goolsbee said the memo “misquoted” him.  In a later AP article Goolsbee said,  “In no possible way was I inferring that he [Obama] was going to introduce any policies that you should ignore and he had no intention of enacting.” On March 3 the Canadian embassy in Washington said it “deeply regrets” the affair, and that “there was no intention to convey, in any way” that Obama was being inconsistent about NAFTA: 29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism – LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel- Truth! In September, 2007, there was a vote in the U.S. Senate on an amendment that designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.  It was sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl (Republican, Arizona) and Joe Lieberman (independent, Connecticut).  Obama was on the campaign trail and was not present for the vote.  Hillary Clinton was and voted in favor of it.  In November, 2007, Obama introduced a Senate resolution that said that President Bush did not have authority to use military force against Iran. 30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet – LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially- Partly Truth! & Unproven! We have not found the “I Am Not Acting As President Yet” quote. This is referring to the 3/1/08 death of FARC warlord Raul Reyes after a strike by the Colombian army.  His laptop computer was seized and among the documents from the computer that were released by the Colombian government was a 2/28/08 letter from Reyes to his inner circle.  The letter said, “two gringos” assured him that “the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots. Obama will not support ‘Plan Colombia’ nor will he sign the TLC (Free Trade Agreement).” It has not been revealed who Reyes had spoken with or whether they had the authority to speak for Obama. 31.) I Didn’t Run Ads In Florida – LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks – and you still lost- Truth! & Disputed! In 2006 the Democratic National Committee (DNC) decided that only four states would be allowed to hold primaries or caucuses before February 5, 2008: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.  The Florida legislature, however, moved both the Republican and Democratic primaries to a week earlier, January 29.  The DNC voted that Florida was in violation of its rules.  The four states that were allowed the early primaries asked presidential candidates to pledge not to campaign in Florida and both Clinton and Obama agreed not to even though both of their names were still on the Florida ballot. In January, 2008, the Clinton campaign accused Obama of violating the promise to avoid campaigning in Florida because of television ads that were running on both CNN and MSNBC. The Obama campaign replied that they were not violating the pledge because they were not targeting Florida.  They were airing national advertisements that they had asked be blacked out in Florida but that the networks had said could not be done.  Obama’s campaign also said that at that time the only one of the four approved states that had not yet held it primary was South Carolina.  The Obama campaign said that it had consulted with Carol Fowler the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party who said that she did not regard the national ads to be a violation of the pledge to the early states. 32.) I Won Michigan – LIAR, no you didn’t- Truth! & Accident! Obama never seriously claimed to have won in Michigan, where his name wasn’t even on the ballot.  During a March 8, 2008 interview on the Today show, he did accidentally include Michigan in a short list of states in which he had won.  Supporters said it was a gaffe from a tired candidate. 33.) I won Nevada – LIAR, no you did not- Fiction! The delegate count from Nevada was a matter of calculation and was a bit complicated.  As a result, both Clinton and Obama made early claims to have won the majority of the delegates.  In the end, Obama did end up with 13 delegates to Clinton’s 12. 34.) I Want All Votes To Count – LIAR, you said let the delegates decide – Unproven! We have not found that Obama advocated letting all delegates decide a candidate for president.  The uncommitted Democratic delegates can make their own decision whom to support.  In Florida, though, if the Democrats were to allow the primary vote to count, each candidate would receive delegates based on what percentage of the votes were cast for him or her. 35.) I Want Americans To Decide – LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time- Opinion! We have not found evidence that Obama prefers caucuses but he had no influence on what each state decides about whether to hold elections or caucuses. 36.) I passed 900 Bills in the State Senate – LIAR, you passed 26, most of which you didn’t write yourself- Fiction! Obama has never claimed passage of 900 bills in the Illinois state senate. 37.) My Campaign Was Extorted By A Friend – LIAR, that friend is threatening to sue if you do not stop saying this. Obama has stopped saying this. Not sure what this is referring to. 38.) I Believe In Fairness, Not Tactics – LIAR, you used tactics to eliminate Alice Palmer from running against you- Mostly Truth! Alice Palmer held the Illinois senate seat that Obama won in his first election in 1995.  During her final year in office she decided to run for the U.S. Congress, but lost.  She then hastily worked on qualifying for the ballot to retain her spot in the senate and some of her supporters even asked Obama to step aside in her favor.  Obama pressed forward, however, and one if his tactics was to challenge hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions for Alice Palmer and three other candidates.  The result was that none of them had enough qualifying signatures and Obama was alone on the ballot.  Obama said he was operating by the rules and that if the candidates couldn’t get enough valid signatures, they might not be effective legislators.  Critics, including some Democrats, criticized Obama for playing hardball in an election in which he had said he wanted to “empower disenfranchised citizens.” 39.) I Don’t Take PAC Money – LIAR, you take loads of it- Fiction! According to FactCheck.org Obama has not received any money from Political Actions Committees (PAC) in the 2007-2008 presidential campaign.  There were some Clinton ads that accused him of taking PAC money but according to FactCheck.org they referred to funds he received during previous campaigns for the Illinois state senate and the U.S. Senate and before he had made the pledge not to take PAC money. 40.) I don’t Have Lobbysists – LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting- Partly Truth! According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama had raised more than $115,000 from “lobbyists” as of March 20, 2008.  FactCheck.org quotes Obama’s campaign as saying this money is all from former lobbyists, not ones that are currently active.  “Obama does not accept funds from registered federal lobbyists but does accept money from spouses of lobbyists, non-lobbying partners who work for lobbying firms or for law firms that do lobbying, ex-lobbyists, and state lobbyists,” according to FactCheck.org. 41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad – LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoo n- Mostly Truth! A campaign controversy erupted in March, 2007 when a video appeared on YouTube that attacked Hillary Clinton.  Hundreds of thousands of viewers saw it on YouTube and as a flap developed about where it came from, the Obama campaign denied that it had anything to do with it.  The creator of the video, Phil de Vellis, finally revealed his identity in an article he wrote for The Huffington Post. It turned out that he was an employee of Blue Stage Digital, an Internet strategy firm being used by the Obama campaign.  In his article, de Vellis said that nobody in his company or in the Obama campaign knew that he had made it.  He did it alone on his Mac computer and uploaded it to YouTube.  He resigned from Blue Stage Digital. 42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace – LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients- Complicated! In 2004 a paralegal from California named Joe Anthony set up a MySpace page in tribute to Barack Obama.  It was unofficial and he volunteered his time to build the page.  After Obama started campaigning for president, Anthony’s page became a vehicle for the Obama campaign, largely because of the large following it had built.  The campaign started working with Anthony on the page and eventually even had the password so it could make direct improvements.  When MySpace set up a channel to focus on the presidential candidates, the Obama campaign elected to use Anthony’s page instead of setting up one of its own.  The site became so successful and attracted so many MySpace friends that the Obama campaign felt it should have more control.  That’s when a dispute arose over what the next step should be.  Anthony said he’d hand the page over to the campaign if he could get compensated for it.  He proposed a payment of $39,000.  The campaign wasn’t responsive to that proposal.  MySpace eventually gave control of the page over to the campaign but Anthony was allowed to retain the online network of friends he had assembled for a new unofficial Obama page. 43.) I Inspire People With My Words – LIAR, you inspire people with other people’s words We have not found this quote from Obama, but it is probably referring to a flap that developed during the primary campaign when Obama was accused of having borrowed words from Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick during a speech without attributing them.  In an address in Wisconsin on February 16, 2008, Obama said, ”Don’t tell me words don’t matter. ‘I have a dream’— just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ — just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ — just words? Just speeches?”  Patrick, during his 2006 campaign for governor, said of his opponent, “but her dismissive point and I hear it a lot from her staff is that all I have to offer is words, just words. ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident,’ just words? Just words? ‘We have nothing to fear itself.’ Just words? ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’ Just words? ‘I have a dream’– just words?”  Patrick, who supported Obama’s candidacy, issued a statement that said “Senator Obama and I are longtime friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language.” 44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate – LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate – for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities- Fiction! Again, this is not a direct quote that we can find, but Obama has introduced or cosponsored several bills that have passed in the senate.  The first federal bill passed with Obama as the primary sponsor was the Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act.  He cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, added three amendments to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which passed in the senate but not the house, cosponsored the Obama, McCaskill bill to provide a safety net for families of wounded military personnel, and several other pieces of legislation. 45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq – LIAR, you weren’t in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date – AGAIN. Obama has consistently opposed the war in Iraq and as a presidential candidate has issued proposals on how he would end the war.  In 2007 he did vote in favor of funding for the war saying that he felt that the troops who are there needed it. 46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care – LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay for the 15,000,000 who don’t have to buy it. This is a confusing statement.  Obama is in favor of universal health care.  He’s not a liar for saying so.  The eRumor criticizes how such care will be paid for, but does not deny that Obama supports it. updated 09/16/08 ","Terrorism"

"Obama Truth Squad-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-truth-squad/"," An eRumor stating that Senator Barak Obama, in an effort to stop the negative ads against him, has recruited people in law enforcement in Missouri to “to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.” "," KMOV-TV reported this story and posted on its web site September 29, 2008.  It said that a group of Obama supporters consisting of two prosecution attorneys and a county sheriff had assembled in St. Louis to intercept Obama rumors and debunk them.  There had been numerous rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign season such as that Senator Obama was a Muslim and had associations with known terrorists such as Bill Ayers.  KMOV-TV said that the group was prepared to stop attacks on their presidential candidate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also reported on September 30, 2008 the formation of the Obama Truth Squad and this was a topic of conversation on the Rush Limbaugh radio show as wells as programs on the Fox News Channel. According to the Post-Dispatch, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer have joined forces to form the “Obama truth squad.” Joyce and McCulloch stated, “The truth squad’s plan is to identify false attacks and respond immediately with truthful information.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch article also stated that these people were all Democrats. It is not uncommon for a campaign to use spokespersons to debunk false claims against the candidate. Senator McCain has used the services of supporters, mostly military and former prisoners of war, although South Carolina House Speaker Bobby Harrell and Henry McMaster, the Attorney General for that state, are listed in his own truth squad to assist in setting the record straight. Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, issued a statement that accused Obama of “police state tactics” which would “intimidate people and kill free debate.” In a telephone interview with Fox News he voiced his concerns about prosecutors and sheriffs responding to false claims against Obama and taking aggressive action. In his statement, Governor Blunt told Obama, “Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts – not a free society.” When asked about intimidating effect on voters, a deputy communications director for the Obama campaign told Fox news that Blunt was mischaracterizing this. According to a news article posted by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis – St. Paul, Minnesota on August 22, 2008, Bill Ayers was part of a group that claimed responsibility for bombings at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s.   Ayers surrendered to authorities in 1980 and owing to misconduct claims against the prosecution his charges were dropped.   Obama stated that he “deplored” Ayers’ actions in the 1960s and that “by the time I met him, he is a professor of education at the University of Illinois.” Critics of the Obama-Ayers relationship said that Obama has had close association with, and the support of, a militant who has never really repented of Pentagon and U.S. Capitol bombings and has actually been quoted in the New York Times on September 11, 2001 as saying that ”I don’t regret setting bombs,” and  ”I feel we didn’t do enough.” Ayers went on to become one of Obama’s most important supporters and the first fund-raiser for Obama’s campaign for the Illinois senate was set up by Ayers. Obama objects to the criticism saying that his association with Ayers was long after his young militant days.  Ayers and Obama served together for the non profit education reform organization, Chicago Annenberg Challenge.

"Costly Presidential Trip To India-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-india-2010-trip/"," This is a forwarded email that says that President Obama is traveling to India on November 6, 2010 and that 570 rooms have been booked at the 5 star Taj Mahal Hotel for his entourage.  The email also alleges that this is a sight seeing trip, a large amount of aircraft and vehicles will be accompanying the President to transport the entourage, 34 warships will be on hand to protect the President, the trip will cost the American taxpayers $200 million a day and that the President and the First Lady will bring their daughters. "," It is true that President Obama is travelling to India and that this will be his biggest trip since he began his term in the Oval Office. On October 31, 2010 article United Kingdom’s Daily Mail said that the entire five star Taj Mahal Hotel has been reserved for “two days of his visit and the property will be a no-go area for non-hotel staff while he is staying.”   Full details of security measures have not been released but the Daily Mail article did say that the U.S. Secret service will “set up two command posts in Delhi and Mumbai which will act as the communication nerve centres.”   As an added security measure, the British paper also said that thirty sniffer dogs will be utilized during the Presidential visit. The trip to India is only the first leg of the President’s ten day trip that will cover India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.  An October 27, 2010 White House press conference confirmed that the President would be accompanied by the First Lady, Michelle Obama. The White House held a press conference on November 4, 2010 to correct what it said were inaccurate reports from international press articles about the upcoming trip that sparked a fury of allegations and viral eRumors on the World Wide Web.   The transcript of the press conference can be found on in a November 4, 2010 article by Fox News. Here is what we have been able to find out: The India visit is not an official state visit but more of a sight seeing trip – Fiction! The White House said that this is not a sight seeing visit as the eRumor alleges but the purpose for this trip is to build important links between the US and India, which is on the fast track towards economic growth. The President will be attending a business summit that was organized by the U.S.-India Business Council.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the President will also be taking part in a commemoration ceremony on the 1 year anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attack. In a briefing , Gibbs said that the President would “take the time to pay his respects to the victims who lost their lives and to sign the guest book there, but also to make some brief remarks.” 40 planes, 3 Helicopters and 6 armored vehicles used to transport entourage – Unproven! TheDaily Mail article did say that 40 planes, including Air Force One, would transport the President and his entourage to India.  The paper said that three Presidential Marine One helicopters and six heavily armored cars, including the President’s fortified “Obama Mobile” Cadillac, fully equipped with nuclear launch codes and communications center, will be on hand to transport the president and members of his party when they arrive in India.   We have not found any official  White House disclosure of logistics for this trip. An entourage of 3,000 travelling with the President to India- Disputed! The Press Trust of India news service said that  “3,000 people including Secret Service agents, US government officials and journalists would accompany the President.”  White House spokesperson Tommy Vietor said, “The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.” Owing to security details Vietor could not go into details but said the numbers were “widely inflated.” A flotilla of 34 warships to protect the President- Fiction! On November 4, 2010 New Delhi Television (NDTV) reported that Obama will be “protected by a fleet of 34 warships, including an aircraft carrier, which will patrol the sea lanes off the Mumbai coast during his two-day stay there beginning Saturday. The measure has been taken as Mumbai attack in 2008 took place from the sea.”  Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters at the White House Press Conference, “I will take the liberty this time of dismissing as absolutely absurd this notion that somehow we are deploying ten percent of the Navy, some 34 ships, and an aircraft carrier in support of the president’s trip to Asia — that’s just comical. Nothing close to that is being done.” This trip will cost the American Tax payers $200 Million a day- Unproven! Similar versions of this eRumor have also been circulating focusing on the current economic conditions in the U.S. and financial cost saying that this trip could cost the American taxpayer $200 Million a day.  According to a November 4, 2010 CBS repor t, those numbers were reported by the Press Trust of India without a substantial source.   CBS News asked the White House to verify this amount  and an email response said, “The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.” The President will be accompanied by children, Sasha and Malia- Fiction! Some false reports from international news agencies originally said that the President will be accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and two daughters, Malia and Sasha.    On October 29, 2010, a Press Trust of India article said that daughters Sasha and Malia will not be travelling to India owing to commitments with school. updated 11/4/10 ","Terrorism"

"," Department of Homeland Security Official David Myers delivered a message from President Obama to the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City during its “Feast of Sacrifice” celebration in October 2014. Meyers read a message in which the president extended “warm greetings” from the American people and lauded the Muslim community there for its relief work after a tornado tore through the area in 2013, local station KFOR reports . “Your service is a powerful example of the powerful roots of the Abrahamic faiths and how our communities can come together with shared peace with dignity and a sense of justice,” Meyers read from Obama’s message in a video posted by KFOR. The eRumor’s claims that Alton Nolen, the man accused of beheading one co-worker at Vaughn Foods and wounding another with a knife in September 2014, attended services held by the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City also appear true. Local authorities said shortly after Nolen’s arrest that he was a recent convert to the Muslim faith and had tried to convert co-workers. However, the FBI approached Nolan’s case as a matter of “workplace violence,” the Washington Post reports . The FBI uses specific criteria to define terrorism, and Nolen had a lengthy criminal record prior to the incident, according to Oklahoma Department of Corrections records . Several members of a prominent mosque in Oklahoma City recalled seeing Nolan attend prayer services. They described him as “quiet, low-key and odd,” the Oklahoman reports . The name and location of the mosque was not disclosed due to security concerns. Leaders of the mosque denounced Nolen’s actions and said Nolan was “as far away as he could be” in keeping with Islam.

"President Obama Hesitated to Give Order to Kill Osama Bin Laden-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-hesitated/"," A Washington “insider” account alleges that President Obama hesitated to give the kill order in the situation room during the May 1, 2011 mission to capture or kill the terrorist Osama Bin Laden.  Various versions of this eRumor say that the President was overridden or overruled by Central Intelligence Agency head Leon Panetta, who really issued the kill order. "," We have not found any evidence to substantiate that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Leon Panetta overrode the President’s authority.   All statements indicate that the order was given on the Thursday prior to the mission. CIA Director Panetta’s Account In a May 3rd NBC news interview Panetta told reporter Brian Williams that the President signed the mission order on the previous Thursday, the 28th of April. Dialog from the NBC interview: BRIAN WILLIAMS:  When did the President’s order in this mission become real and go up and become a possibility? LEON PANETTA: Well, as you know as we’ve been- debating this issue for a long time. And we had a number of sessions at the White House going over all of the intelligence and all of the approaches as to how we would conduct these operations. But it wasn’t until Thursday morning that the national security advisor called me and said that the President had made a decision to proceed with this operation. And then later that day I received orders signed by the President of the United States to proceed to conduct this operation under Title 50, which means it was a covert operation. And we would be responsible from the President for seeing that this mission was accomplished. White House photo of President Obama and his staff watching the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden The President’s Account On May 8, 2011 the President appeared on the CBS Sixty Minutes program and told reporter Steve Kroft that he was in the situation room monitoring the mission.  Obama was aware of unfolding events around the compound and getting reports from special forces operations head Bill McRaven and Leon Panetta. Dialog from President Obama’s account of the mission on CBS 60 Minutes program: KROFT: I want to go to the Situation Room. What was the mood? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tense. KROFT: People talking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, but doing a lot of listening as well, ’cause we were able to monitor the situation in real time. Getting reports back from Bill McRaven, the head of our special forces operations, as well as Leon Panetta. And you know, there were big chunks of time in which all we were doin’ was just waiting. And it was the longest 40 minutes of my life with the possible exception of when Sasha got meningitis when she was three months old, and I was waiting for the doctor to tell me that she was all right. It was a very tense situation. KROFT: Were you nervous? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What could you see? PRESIDENT OBAMA: As I said, we were monitoring the situation. And we knew as events unfolded what was happening in and around the compound, but we could not get information clearly about what was happening inside the compound. KROFT: Right. And that went on for a long time? Could you hear gunfire? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had a sense of when gunfire and explosions took place. KROFT: Flashes? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. And we also knew when one of the helicopters went down in a way that wasn’t according to plan. And, as you might imagine that made us more tense. KROFT: So it got off to a bad start? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it did not go exactly according to planned, but this is exactly where all the work that had been done anticipating what might go wrong made a huge difference. KROFT: There was a backup plan? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a backup plan. KROFT: You had to blow up some walls? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had to blow up some walls. KROFT: When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? That bin Laden was in there? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed. And Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious. But at that point cautiously optimistic. KROFT: What was your reaction when you heard those words? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I was relieved and I wanted to make sure those guys got over the Pakistan border and landed safely. And I think deeply proud and deeply satisfied of my team. KROFT: When did you start to feel comfortable that bin Laden had been killed? PRESIDENT OBAMA: When they landed we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him. Photographs had been taken. Facial analysis indicated that in fact it was him. We hadn’t yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure. KROFT: Did you see the pictures? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What was your reaction when you saw them? PRESIDENT OBAMA: It was him. Also,  there did not appear to be any delay in the President’s decision once intelligence confirmed the location of the Al Qaeda leader.  Rigorous planning took place months prior to the mission which included the President being briefed on every stage of the mission plan as well as back up contingency plans.   Obama said this about the Special Forces team and the planning, “Obviously we have extraordinary guys. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they’d bring back to me.” CIA Statement In a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) statement to employees that was reported in the Wall Street Journal on May 2, 2011 , the CIA head wrote. “Persistent hard work produced the results that the American people expect of their intelligence service: We gave President Obama and his team accurate, relevant, timely intelligence—providing the information and insight they needed at key points as this mission developed. I offered my personal thanks to the President for his willingness to make the courageous decision to proceed with the operation.” updated 05/09/11 ","Terrorism"

"," The National Defense Appropriations Act of 2012 is real.  It does expand the power of the military in the war against terrorism and one of the provisions of the act is what has prompted controversy about the rights of those who fall under the definition as detainees. On November 30, 2011 the Harvard Law and Policy Review looked at S-1867 , the Senate version of the bill.  Calling the text of the lengthy bill “confusing” the article said that it believed that “the offending part is Sec. 1032 (a), which states that the military ‘shall’ hold a person captured in the course of the war on terror in military custody until the military can determine the person’s disposition under the law of war.”   The article questioned the authority of the military to detain U.S. Citizens over the lack of “territorial limitation on this directive.”  Section 1032 of the bill authorizes the President to prioritize guidance strategies to “deny safe havens to al-Qaeda and its violent extremist affiliates and to strengthen at-risk states.” HR-1540 The National Defense Appropriations Act of 2012 We examined the text of the bill and it affirms the “authority of the armed forces of the united states to detain covered persons pursuant to the authorization for use of military force.”   The text of the bill defines a “covered” person as: (1) A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks. (2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces. Bill History and Status: HR-1540-265 is the 565 page National Defense Appropriations Act of 2012 that was introduced on the House of Representatives floor on April 14, 2011.  The bill has forty eight proposed amendments. Govtrack.US, the website that tracks federal legislation, reported that it was passed by Congress on May 26, 2011. The Senate passed its version, S-1867 , on the First of December after some amendments were added to the bill. The bill then went back to House of Representatives to resolve differences between the Senate and the House for final passage on December 14, 2011. According to a December 14, 2011   article in the New York Times ,  President Obama threatened to veto the bill “arguing that provisions would open the door for the military to perform policing functions inside the United States, and that they would infringe on executive branch powers.” On December 31, 2011 President Obama, while vacationing in Hawaii, signed the bill into law . An Adobe PDF copy of the final version of bill can be read by clicking this link to the Library of Congress: HR-1540 PDF Another rumor about this bill has been circulating the Internet alleging that the U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill that repeals Article 125 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice.

"New Federal ID Number-Under the Skin of the Hand?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/federalid/"," This is long narrative by a woman who went through a hassle trying to get a California driver’s license after moving there from Alaska.  She says she was told by the Department of Motor Vehicles in California that everyone is going to have to have al Federal ID Number which will be implanted under the skin of the left hand and that nothing can be transacted with the government without it.  She said she was told that all the hassle she went through getting her license was because of the new requirements for the Federal ID Number.  This eRumor started appearing on the Internet in April, 2007. "," The most incendiary part of this eRumor is the information about a number being required under the skin of the left hand—and it is false.  It hearkens to several other eRumors that have circulated about people being required to have identification chips implanted into their bodies or on their right hands or foreheads, which brings up speculation about Biblical prophecy about “The End Times.” The heart of the eRumor is about the “Federal Tax ID Number.”  There is no such terminology about individual citizens but there has been legislation passed in the U.S. Congress under what was called the REAL ID act and that sought to establish minimum standards for driver’s licenses and identification cards that would be acceptable by Federal Agencies.   The legislation prohibits Federal Agencies from accepting IDs for any official purposes that have not been issued based on the requirements of the act, although some states will get extensions and there will be a phasing-in period of 5-years for everything to be working correctly.  The Department of Homeland Security says this is not a “National ID Card.”  It is simply an attempt to establish common standards for states to issue licenses and identication cards.  The licenses will be issued from each state, not the Federal government. Driver’s licenses are accepted as legitimate ID at airports, for example, when you show up to board a flight.  That means that the issuance of a driver’s license should be based on the kind of documentation that will prove that the person who is getting it is really who he or she claims to be.  The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the reliability and accuracy of ID documents.  The commission report said that for terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons and that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers had some kind of identifying document, some by fraud. Regarding the woman’s ordeal in getting her license, it is not hard to understand what she was required to provide.  If you come to California from another state, a valid driver’s license is accepted as ID for a California license, but not an expired one.  If your name has changed, such as through marriage or divorce, you are required to have the documentation of that change in order to either get a license or have a name changed on a license. The part of the eRumor that says a number will be required under the skin of your left hand may have been prompted by questions about whether some of the states may want to embed what are called RFID devices in the drivers licenses.  RIFD stands for “radio frequency identification” and refers to small, inexpensive chips that are increasingly used for a variety of things including identifying products in stores.  It’s a high-tech electronic substitute for bar codes.  An RIFD chip doesn’t require a battery and merely needs to be passed near a special device to be read.  RIFD devices have also been implanted into animals for identification purposes and there is some use of RIFD devices being implanted in humans for the same reason.  That led a big eRumor several years ago about a chip made by Mondex and that it was going to be used by governments to track and control its citizens.  For more information about that, CLICK HERE.

"," The mostly commonly circulated version of this was originally written by Barry Loudermilk, an Air Force Veteran who sent it to The Bartow Trader newspaper in Georgia. The stories it references are true, but some have changed since the email was written. There is a later version that begins with a reference to the state of Florida allowing a Moslem woman to have her drivers license photo taken with her face covered.  That was a true story, but the woman, Najat Tamim-Muhammad, ultimately agreed to a compromise that allowed her face to be visible in the picture, which was not for a drivers license, but for a Florida state ID card. In Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, a “God Bless America” banner was erected at the Wolf Creek Elementary School.  There were a few complaints to the school board and an opinion from the Oklahoma State School Boards Association was interpreted to mean the banner ought to be taken down.  According to ChannelOklahoma.com, however, what the School Boards Association had said was that the phrase “God Bless America” could be used as a part of patriotic displays.  The local school board then issued a memo saying the school could use the banner, although not everybody agreed with the decision. The Channel 12 decision was similar to ones made by other media outlets.  They were concerned that even though they might be American patriots, they wanted their reporting of the news to be unattached to and unaffected by patriotic symbols.  According to a Fox News report on September 21, here was protest among the viewers and the news director at Channel 12, Pat Dolan, went on the air more than once to explain the decision and say that the employees of the station were “proud to be Americans.” In Berkeley, American flags were placed on fire trucks after the September 11 attacks.  According to a 9/20/01 UPI report, city officials felt it would be best to take the flags off because of expected anti-war rallies.  They said it was not an unpatriotic decision on their part or else the flags would not have already been on the trucks.  They were using wisdom gained from past anti-war events. The Florida Gulf Coast University story is also true.  Library services director Kathy Hoeth told workers at service desks to remove stickers that said “Proud to be an American.”  She said she feared they would offend foreign students.  According to the Fort Myers News-Press, she quickly retracted the order and called it a bad decision.  The president of the university also issued an apology.

TruthOrFiction contacted the person who wrote the original article, columnist Doug Patton.  His daily column of social and political commentary is seen in several newspapers and on several websites. The comments in the Pam Foster email were from a column he wrote for publication on June 6, 2005, the original of which is below. Doug Patton Column of June 6, 2005 First, Newsweek pulled a Dan Rather on us, running a fabricated story just because they wanted it to be true. They told the world that an American guard at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center had ripped pages from a prisoner’s Koran and flushed it down a toilet. As a result, innocent people died when practitioners of Islam rioted in protest in Afghanistan . Oops, said Newsweek, it seems we can’t back up our story. Oh well, it’s probably true; we just can’t prove it. The lie heard round the world about the flushed Koran has caused convulsions in the Bush Administration and forced the Pentagon to launch an investigation of unfounded allegations contained in an unsubstantiated story. The results of said investigation are now in, and it seems there are at least five incidents of “mishandling” of the Koran at Gitmo. Well, guess what? I DON’T CARE! Are we fighting a war on terror or aren’t we? Was it or was it not started by Islamic people who brought it to our shores on September 11, 2001? Were people from all over the world, mostly Americans, not brutally murdered that day, in downtown Manhattan , across the Potomac from our nation’s capitol and in a field in Pennsylvania ? Did nearly three thousand men, women and children die a horrible, burning death that day, or didn’t they? And I’m supposed to care that a copy of the Koran was “desecrated” when an overworked American soldier kicked it or got it wet? Well, I don’t. I don’t care at all. I’ll start caring when Osama bin Laden turns himself in and repents for incinerating all those innocent people on 9/11. I’ll care about the Koran when the fanatics in the Middle East start caring about the Holy Bible, the mere possession of which is a crime in Saudi Arabia . I’ll care when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi tells the world he is sorry for hacking off Nick Berg’s head while Berg screamed through his gurgling, slashed throat. I’ll care when the cowardly so-called “insurgents” in Iraq come out and fight like men instead of disrespecting their own religion by hiding in mosques. I’ll care when the mindless zealots who blow themselves up in search of nirvana care about the innocent children within range of their suicide bombs. I’ll care when the American media stops pretending that their First Amendment liberties are somehow derived from international law instead of the United States Constitution’s Bill of Rights. I’ll care when Clinton-appointed judges stop ordering my government to release photos of the abuses at Abu Ghraib, which are sure to set off the Islamic extremists just as Newsweek’s lies did a few weeks ago. In the meantime, when I hear a story about a brave marine roughing up an Iraqi terrorist to obtain information, know this: I don’t care. When I see a fuzzy photo of a pile of naked Iraqi prisoners who have been humiliated in what amounts to a college hazing incident, rest assured that I don’t care. When I see a wounded terrorist get shot in the head when he is told not to move because he might be booby-trapped, you can take it to the bank that I don’t care. When I hear that a prisoner, who was issued a Koran paid for by my tax dollars, is complaining that his holy book is being “mishandled,” you can absolutely believe in your heart of hearts that I don’t care. And oh, by the way, I’ve noticed that sometimes it’s spelled “Koran” and other times “Quran.” Well, Jimmy Crack Corn and — you guessed it — I don’t care! ","Terrorism"

"," The document is real and one in a series of assessments issued to law enforcement agencies about potential threats to national security.  A similar report on left wing groups was issued in January 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Intelligence and Analysis did release an unclassified 9 page report called “Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment.” It was issued to law enforcement agencies according to an April 15, 2009 statement by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. The eRumor suggested that the report reflects a troubling mindset in the administration against pro-lifers, veterans, supporters of third-party presidential candidates like Ron Paul or Chuck Baldwin, and evangelical Christians. Secretary Napolitano said her office is “Concerned with its primary mission to ‘prevent terrorist attacks on our nation’’ and  “We are on the lookout for criminal and terrorist activity but we do not – nor will we ever – monitor ideology or political beliefs.

House Minority Leader John Boehner called the report “Offensive and Unacceptable” and demanded an “explanation for why she has abandoned using the term ‘terrorist’ to describe those, such as al Qaeda, who are plotting overseas to kill innocent Americans, while her own Department is using the same term to describe American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation.” Boehner also said that the agency should apologize to veterans.

Conservative journalist, Michelle Malkin, wrote an article on April 14, 2009, calling the report a “hit job on conservatives” and said that it was “one of the most embarrassingly shoddy pieces of propaganda I’d ever read out of DHS. I couldn’t believe it was real.” Click for Malkin article. On April 16, 2009 Fox News reported that Secretary Napolitano issued an apology to veterans in an on air interview saying, “To the extent veterans read it as an accusation … an apology is owed.” Napolitano offered this explanation, “This was an assessment, not an accusation. It was limited to extremists those who seek to commit violence within the United States. And all this was meant to do was to give law enforcement what we call ‘situational awareness.'” Click for Fox News story updated 04/16/09 ","Terrorism"

Dee McCown wrote an open letter that claims Attorney General Eric Holder joined racial antagonists in politicizing the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. "," It’s true that K. Dee McCown, a former FBI agent, penned this “epic” letter to Holder. McCown worked as a special agent and supervisory agent for the FBI from 1997 to 2008. He focused on counterterrorism, counterintelligence, criminal programs and hostage rescue. He has since transitioned to the private sector. TruthorFiction.com tracked McCown down in Texas, and he confirmed authorship of the letter to Holder in an online message: I am in fact the author of the letter to Mr. Holder and stand behind every word. It is time that we collectively push back and speak truth to power. Thank you and God bless. McCown sent the open letter to Holder on December 28, 2014. It quickly went viral and appeared on websites, blogs and forwarded emails across the web. McCown is critical of the attorney general’s public response to the high-profile deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner in the letter: Following the Michael Brown case Grand Jury decision all (Mr. Holder) could muster was the following comment: “The Department of Justice is currently investigating not only the shooting but also the Ferguson police department in what is called a “patterns and practices” inquiry to determine if the police department has engaged in systematic racism.” So, let’s get this straight. At a decisive moment in history when our nation required a strong and unbiased voice from its’ senior law enforcement official, you Mr. Holder, made it your personal mission to join with other racial antagonist and politicize a tragic event, accusing a young white police officer of a racially motivated killing in what we now know was a justified self-defense shooting of a predatory felon. Your behavior is unbelievable. You sir, have sacrificed your integrity on the altar of political expediency. You, Mr. Holder, are the “coward” and hypocrite you so loudly denounce when speaking of broken race relations in America. Holder and McCown simultaneously worked at the Department of Justice at various times between 1997 and 2008. Holder served as deputy attorney general under President Clinton.

"," This is a hoax, but judging from the emails we’re getting, people want something about it to be true. It is built upon the previously known fact that “NYC” has corresponding symbols in Wingdings that seem to have destructive meaning too. “Q33NY” is not associated in any way with any of the hijacked airliners.  It is not one of the flight numbers.  It is not the tail (registration) number of any of the airplanes (we have the actual tail numbers below), and was not a designation on radar that day, and is not the identity of the subway tunnel leading to the airport or the World Trade Center.  It’s not one of the gate numbers.  With few exceptions, all civilian aircraft in the U.S. have a tail number that begins with “N.”  TruthOrFiction.com has searched the FAA database that includes all airliners and found no airplane with Q33NY or any that begin with “Q” at all. There’s been a bit of mischief with this eRumor along the way.  The original version is the one we have below.  It clearly stated it was referring to the “flight number.”  It was easily demonstrated, however, that was not a flight number of any of the hijacked jets.  Other versions started circulating that said it was the “tail number” or the “registration number.”  More recently, some versions are making the rounds that claim it was the gate number. Here is the information about each flight: … American Airlines flight #11 . Took off from Boston destined for Los Angeles. Struck the World Trade Center.

The eRumor says that a billion dollars is going to be divided by 6,000 victims, or about $167,000 per family.  In reality, the money is going to be spread more broadly.  The funds are not only for those who lost someone in death.  The Chronicle has surveyed some of the organizations and intended destinations of funds.  They include: …Support for immediate family members of firefighters, police officers, and emergency workers who died. …Help for recovery workers with financial or counseling need. …Help for families who are without income because of unemployment that resulted from the attacks. …Help for those who were injured. …Help for funeral and memorial service travel expenses for those who lost family members. …Supplies for relief workers. …Help for charities that experienced losses. …Assistance for small businesses affected. …Help for poor people affected by the attacks. …Costs for treatment of respiratory ailments for those who do not have health insurance coverage. …Support of injured police officers.
