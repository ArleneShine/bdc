"Meet Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump’s Education Secretary-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-11-28 11:54:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/meet-betsy-devos-donald-trumps-education-secretary/"," President-elect Donald Trump selected billionaire Betsy DeVos to serve as Secretary of Education because she donated millions to his campaign, but she has no experience in education and opposes public schools. "," Rumors about Betsy DeVos, President-elect Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, circulating on social media are a combination of truth and fiction. These claims can be traced back to a meme titled “Meet Betsy DeVos” that began circulating after Trump tapped her to serve as Secretary of Education. The meme lists a number of reasons why DeVos is unqualified to hold the post and argues that she was rewarded for donating $9.5 million to Trump’s campaign. We’ll start out by providing a little background. Betsy DeVos is the daughter-in-law of Richard DeVos, the founder of Amway with an estimated net worth of about $5.1 billion. The DeVos family is known for supporting Republican causes. Betsy and her husband “Dick” DeVos have focused their lobbying efforts on education, school choice and opposition to Common Core standards through their Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation . Now we’ll take a look at some of the specific claims made in the ”Meet Betsy DeVos” meme making the rounds on social media. Betsy DeVos Donated $9.5 Million to Trump’s Campaign- Fiction! Betsy DeVos didn’t back Donald Trump during his campaign, and she even went on the record as saying that Trump “does not represent the Republican Party” before the election. However, as the owners of the nation’s largest charter school lobbying organization, the DeVos family spent heavily to influence other races during the 2016 election cycle. The Detroit Free Press reports that the DeVos Family contributed $1.45 million to Republican state lawmakers in Michigan alone over a seven-week period after they backed off a proposal to step up oversight on charter schools in the state. Overall, it’s not clear how much the DeVos family spent in the 2016 election cycle, but claims that Betsy DeVos donated $9.5 million to Trump’s campaign can easily be proven false. Betsy DeVos Doesn’t Have an Education Degree, Has No Classroom Experience- Truth! Calvin College in Michigan issued a release saying that DeVos graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in the college’s “economics group” in 1979 — so it’s true that she doesn’t have formal training in education. And Inside Higher Ed reported the Devos would be “the first education secretary without a substantial background in higher education” to serve in the position. But DeVos has been involved in educational policy for nearly 30 years. She serves as chair of the Alliance for School Choice , the American Federation for Children and the Great Lakes Education Project , all of which advocate for school choice. DeVos is also a board member of the “Christ-centered” Potter’s House School and of the Foundation for Excellence in Education , which was founded by Jeb Bush in 2008. Betsy DeVos Does Not Support Public Education- Disputed! Betsy DeVos has signaled that she supports personal choice and freedom over traditional public education models from a policy standpoint — but the DeVos family has supported public schools in Michigan with donations. A DeVos spokesperson pushing back on claims the DeVos does not support public education told the Detroit News that the DeVos family has quietly helped many underprivileged children in Michigan over the years. But it’s not clear that help has come through support for public education. In an interview with Philanthropy Roundtable , DeVos talked about the failures of “traditional public schools” boosting support for her school choice initiatives across the country, and that seems to be where these claims come from: This confluence of events is forcing people to take note, particularly because of the public’s awareness that traditional public schools are not succeeding. In fact, let’s be clear, in many cases, they are failing. That’s helped people become more open to what were once considered really radical reforms—reforms like vouchers, tax credits, and education savings accounts. … I’m most focused on educational choice. But, thinking more broadly, what we are trying to do is tear down the mindset that assigns students to a school based solely on the zip code of their family’s home. We advocate instead for as much freedom as possible. One long-term trend that’s working in our favor is technology. It seems to me that, in the internet age, the tendency to equate “education” with “specific school buildings” is going to be greatly diminished. Within the right framework of legislation, that freedom will ultimately be healthy for the education of our kids. Given all that, we’re calling this one “disputed.” Betsy DeVos Believes School Teachers Are Overpaid- Unproven! There doesn’t appear to be any record of Betsy DeVos arguing that public school teachers are overpaid, but a non-profit tied to DeVos reached that conclusion in a 2011 study . The American Enterprises Institute and the Heritage Foundation study concludes that, “Public school teachers receive total compensation more than 50 percent greater than that of private sector employees — if you take into account benefits, job security, summer vacations and other factors.” However, it’s not clear that DeVos personally holds that view. In conclusion, claims made in the “Meet Betsy DeVos” meme are true, false, unproven and disputed. ","Education"
"Elementary School Forces Kids to Cross Dress for LGBT Week-Fiction!","2016-06-02 10:13:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/elementary-school-forces-kids-cross-dress-lgbt-week/"," A report that Sunny Oaks Elementary School in California forced students to cross dress to celebrate Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) week have gone viral. "," Rumors that children at Sunny Oaks Elementary School in California were forced to cross dress to celebrate LGBT week are false. These rumors trace back to The Free Patriot , a website that publishes fake news reports with a right-wing slant. The story, which appeared under the headline “Elementary School Forces Students to Cross Dress for LGBT Week,” reports: Sunny Oaks Elementary School in California is making headlines this week for the absurd thing they are having their students participate in. The staff is under question by parents and media after a student came home complaining to her parents that she had to dress up in boys clothes over her dress that she wore to school. Parents of the girl said to Fox News, “It is bad enough that our society is now forcing us to allow transgenders into the wrong bathrooms, but for our school system to teach our kids that this is normal is absolutely wrong.” Key details of the story don’t check out. First, there’s no school in California listed under the name “Sunny Oaks Elementary.” The only online footprint from the so-called school is The Free Patriot article. Second, a picture that supposedly shows Sunny Oaks Elementary that ran with the story doesn’t actually show sunny oaks elementary. It shows PERSON’s International Elementary School in Canada . The school’s name has been airbrushed from the side of the building in The American Patriot article, but it can be seen in the original: Third, the story cites a FOX News report about the elementary students being forced to cross-dress that doesn’t actually exist. Given all that, we’re call reports that kids at an elementary school in California were forced to cross dress for LGBT week “fiction.”a ","Education"
"Oxford Pushes Back Letter About Cecil Rhodes Statute-Unproven!","2016-03-30 12:43:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/oxford-pushes-back-letter-cecil-rhodes-statute/"," An open letter to Oxford students demanding that a statute of Oxford benefactor Cecil Rhodes be removed from campus has gone viral. "," No author is listed for this open letter to Oxford University students demanding the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statute, and we haven’t been able to verify where it came from. The “ Rhodes Must Fall ” movement gained widespread publicity in early 2016. The Cecil Rhodes statute, which has sat outside a building at Oriel College for more than 100 years, represents racism and colonialism, student activists have argued. According to a Change.org petition started by supporters of the group: We find it deplorable that Oriel College continues to glorify an international criminal through its uncritical, deeply violent iconography. As long as the statue remains, Oriel College and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with Rhodes’s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism and patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university – which for many of us is also our home. The removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University’s attempt to redress the ways in which it has been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of the crimes of the man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to condone the persistent racism that shadows this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes’ legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on “painting the map red” (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships . Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for “their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.” Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should “think about being educated elsewhere,” The Guardian reports : In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports : “I think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don’t agree with them,” he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. “But if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for any undergraduate, Karl Popper’s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.” “That focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it’s an example of what’s happening in American campuses and British campuses,” Patten said. “One of the points of a university – which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free inquiry and debate – is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don’t like and talk about them and debate them.” He added: “Can you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people, it’s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to talk about western values, which I regard as glob.” By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the “Oxford Pushes Back” letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten’s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there’s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there’s no way to tell who the original author was. ","Education"
"7th Graders Forced to Write, “Allah is the Only God”-Truth!","2015-09-14 14:21:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/7th-graders-forced-to-write-allah-is-the-only-god/"," Seventh grade students in Tennessee were forced to write, “Allah is the Only God,” as part of a social studies lesson. "," This one is mostly true. As part of a social studies lesson on Islam, seventh graders at Spring Hill Middle School in Tennessee learned about the Shanada, the first of five pillars of Muslim of Faith. The mother of one of the students protested when she saw that her daughter had been instructed to write, “Allah is the only God,” the Spring Hill Home Page reports : (The mother) said her daughter’s teacher “was not happy about it,” but told the parent she must teach to the standards. “She said this will be on TCAPs. Both her teacher and Principal Shanda Sparrow said students would not have to write the Shahada again. “The teacher approached my daughter before class and was very understanding. My daughter told her she would not recite or write the Shahada or anything saying ‘Allah is the only God.’ The teacher said she wouldn’t have to.” Maury County Director of Schools Chris Marczak said in a statement that the Tennessee State Board of Education had included the curriculum in its curriculum standards, so the school had no choice but to include the lesson: In middle school, the standards have us address early American History, world history early civilizations to the Roman Empire, middle ages through exploration of the Americas, and colonization to reconstruction of the Americas. Our teachers work together to make sure that our students are learning what is expected through the Tennessee academic standards. For this last section on the Islamic World this past week, our educators had students complete an assignment that had an emphasis on Islamic Faith. The assignment covered some sensitive topics that are of importance to Islamic religion and caused some confusion around whether we are asking students to believe in or simply understand the religion. It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate. That section of the state’s social study curriculum is labeled “Islamic World, 400 A.D./C.E. — 1500s.” The section summary says, “Students analyze the geographical, political, economic, social and religious structures of the civilizations.” The Shahada isn’t listed in the curriculum, which focuses on historical, geographical and cultural aspects of the religion: 7.3 Identify the physical location and features and the climate of the Arabian Peninsula, its relationship to surrounding bodies of land and water, including Northern Africa, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Nile River. (G) 7.4 Describe the expansion of Muslim rule through conquests and the spread of cultural diffusion of Islam and the Arabic language. (C, E, G, H) 7.5 Trace the origins of Islam and the life and teachings of Muhammad, including Islam’s historical connections to Judaism and Christianity. (C, H) 7.6 Explain the significance of the Qur’an and the Sunnah as the primary sources of Islamic beliefs, practice, and law and their influence in Muslims’ daily life. (C, H, P) 7.7 Analyze the origins and impact of different sects within Islam, Sunnis and Shi’ites. (C, H) 7.8 Examine and summarize the contributions Muslim scholars made to later civilizations in the areas of science, geography, mathematics, philosophy, medicine, art, and literature. (C, G, H) 7.9 Describe the establishment of trade routes among Asia, Africa, and Europe and the role of merchants in Arab society. (E, G, H) 7.10 Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources to examine the art and architecture, including the Taj Mahal during the Mughal period. (C, H) 7.11 Explain the importance of Mehmed II the Conqueror and Suleiman the Magnificent. (H, P) 7.12 Write an explanatory text to describe the Shah Abbas and how his policies of cultural blending led to the Golden Age and the rise of the Safavid Empire. (C, H, P) Primary Documents and Supporting Texts to Consider: excerpts from The Hadith, Muhammad; excerpts from The Book of Golden Meadows, Masoudi. The Shahada conveys two fundamental beliefs of Muslims: There is no God but God, and Muhammad is the prophet of Allah: In Islam, the first of the five pillars is the shahada. Shahada is the Muslim profession of faith, expressing the two simple, fundamental beliefs that make one a Muslim: La ilaha illa Allah wa-Muhammad rasul Allah. There is no god but God and Muhammad is the prophet of Allah. Sincere recitation of this confession of faith before of two Muslims is the sole requirement for those who wish to join the Muslim community. It represents acceptance not only of Allah and his prophet, but of the entirety of Islam. As one of the Pillars, the shahada must be recited correctly aloud with full understanding and internal assent at least once in every Muslim’s lifetime. So, we’re calling this one mostly true for the simple fact that students weren’t forced to write or recite the Shahada if the chose not to, according to reports, but everything else is true.

"Cornell University Would Welcome ISIS Training Camps, Speakers-Disputed!","2015-03-29 17:41:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cornell-university-would-welcome-isis-training-camps-and-speakers/"," A Cornell University dean said he would allow an ISIS training camps and speakers on the campus. "," Claims that an assistant dean at Cornell said ISIS training exercises and speakers would be allowed there are disputed. A man posing as a student from Morocco used a hidden camera to record an exchange with Cornell Dean for Students Joseph Scaffido for Project Veritas , an organization founded by conservative activist James O’Keefe. In the video, the student asks Scaffido questions about starting a humanitarian group for distressed areas of the Middle East, bringing people to the campus to speak, and holding training exercises for “freedom fighters.” Here’s a transcript of the conversation: Student: I think maybe it would be nice to start a humanitarian group that supports distressed communities, a humanitarian group in the Middle East, in northern Iraq and Syria. I think it would be important especially for people in the Islamic State Iraq and Syria, the families and the freedom fighters in particular. I think it would be important to maybe just probably educate, but to maybe send them care packages, whether it be food, water, electronics. Scaffido: There are a lot of our student organizations that do things like that all over the world. Student: If you did like, supported like Hamas or something like that, is that a problem? Scaffido: The university is not going to look at different groups and say, ‘You’re not allowed to support that group because we don’t believe in them,’ or something like that. I think it’s just the opposite. I think the university wants the entire community to understand what’s going on in all parts of the world. Student: That would be good. Maybe, you know, get a group that educates on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and just educate people, maybe bring them in. Scaffido: Ithaca is a great place. Ithaca itself, the community of Ithaca is also very active. I don’t know if you’ve talked to many people about it, it’s very liberal; the community is a very liberal community … There are funding sources on campus … kind of like grants, programming money. If I wanted to bring in a speaker… Student: Maybe we could get like a freedom fighter to come and do like a training camp for students? Scaffido: I have no idea. I mean, you would be allowed to do something like that. It’s just like bringing in a coach to do training on a sports team or something. Scaffido definitely doesn’t say that these things wouldn’t be allowed on campus. But an unedited version of the video would be needed to understand his actual responses. After video of the interview went viral, Cornell officials shot back that it had been creatively edited to make Scaffido appear to endorse ISIS training camps and speakers on the campus. In a statement , Cornell University President David Skorton said the video’s allegations were ludicrous and offensive: “As the president of Cornell University, I want to be clear that the notion that Cornell would allow ISIS training sessions on our campus is ludicrous and absolutely offensive. “Project Veritas, the organization behind this shoddy piece of ‘journalism’ has been repeatedly vilified for dishonest, deceitful activity. It is shameful that any individual would pose as a student facing racial discrimination at another university, ask leading questions on hidden camera about Cornell’s tolerance for differing viewpoints and backgrounds, and then conveniently splice together the resulting footage to smear our assistant dean and our University. After speaking with Assistant Dean Scaffido, I am convinced that he was not aware of what he was being asked. “Let me be clear: Cornell has an unwavering commitment to the free and responsible exchange of ideas. However, we remain vigilant in maintaining an appropriate balance of freedom of expression within accepted boundaries. Of course, incitement to violence is not protected and would never be tolerated on our campus.” ","Education"

The email also says that 35 governors have sued for a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would limit federal power. "," Both of these claims are false. There is a Student Loan Repayment Program in place to help attract and retain federal employees, but it does not extend to family members. Elected officials, uniform service members and other government employees are eligible under the law . Federal employees can have up to $10,000 in federally insured student loans repaid each year, and up to $60,000 repaid over their career, the Office of Personnel Management reports . And the federal government does not forgive these loans, as the eRumor claims. The loans are repaid. That’s important because it means federal employees have to pay taxes on loan payments just like the rest of their salaries. In 2013, $52.9 million in student loan repayments were made for 7,314 federal employees, the Office of Personnel and Management reports . The email’s claim that 35 governors had sued the U.S. government for a 28th amendment is also false. The email says that the proposed 28th amendment would state: “Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators, Representatives of Congress; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States…” That same language was used in an eRumor that TruthorFiction.com found to be false in 2013.

At last count, three states had tried to force a constitutional convention. Resolutions in Kansas, Georgia and Indiana sought to balance state and federal power, the Huffington Post reports .

The children at Whitwell school discovered that the Norwegians, who invented the paper clip, wore paper clips during World War II to protest Nazism.  It was decided to try to collect 6 million paper clips to represent the number of Jews killed during the holocaust and to erect some kind of memorial for them.  The collection project mushroomed and the children received paper clip contributions from people like President Bill Clinton and director Steven Spielberg.  By 2001 the school had received more than 30 million paperclips. One thing led to another and the school was able to secure an actual railroad car from Germany that was used to transport holocaust victims.  It is the heart of a memorial that contains 11 million paper clips, representing all the victims of the holocaust, not just Jews.

The school is a part of Palisades Charter Schools, which operate       under the Los Angeles Unified School District, but independently.

"Teacher Reveals True Meaning of Common Core Education Standards – Truth!","2015-03-17 16:52:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/teacher-reveals-true-meaning-of-common-core-education-standards/"," A teacher named David Pook said he helped write the Common Core Education Standards because he wanted all kids to have the same opportunities to learn how to read that he had as a white male in society. "," This one is true. Dr. David Pook is a professor at Granite State College in New Hampshire and helped write the language arts portion of Common Core, the non-profit group Student Achievement Partners reports . Toward the end of a two-hour debate on Common Core held on May 19, 2014, David Pook explained why he got involved with Common Core: “The reason why I helped write the standards and the reason why I am here today is that as a white male in society I have been given a lot of privilege that I didn’t earn, and as a result I think it’s really important that all kids get an equal opportunity to learn how to read. I think I had certain advantages as a result of who I was … and when I walk into places like Roberto Clemente High School on the west side of Chicago, I think that it’s important that those kids have a chance to learn how to read just as well as I had the opportunity to learn how to read. And creating an equitable educational opportunity for all kids, I think this is actually the greatest lesson we could teach all our kids.” People in the audience gasped, booed and laughed at the comment. The website Campus Reform posted a video of it in 2014, and it gained a lot of attention on the web. In March of 2015, blogs like Liberty News picked up the story again: “Dr. David Pook, Granite State College professor and chair of the Derryfield School’s history department has publicly admitted that his involved in the development of common core was motivated by his desire to end ‘white privilege.’” Many later versions of the eRumor quote David Pook as saying that he wants to “end white privilege,” but he didn’t actually say that in the video.

"The little girl who died and left 57 cents to build a biggerchurch-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hattiemaywiatt/"," The touching story is about a little girl from a poor family who loved attending Sunday School, but there were so many children and the church was so small that she sometimes couldn’t get in.  The later died and the pastor of the church was called to handle her service.  It was discovered that she had been saving money to help pay for a larger church.  It amounted to 57 cents.  That 57 cents became the spark for a series of fund-raising campaigns that resulted in the buildings of Temple Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Temple University, Good Samaritan Hospital, and a large Sunday School building. "," The story of a little girl who left 57-cents for a new church is true, but the version of the eRumor that is circulating has some details thrown in that are not.  The little girl’s 57-cents did inspire the efforts that resulted in the purchase of property and construction of buildings, but did not actually purchase the property outright. A first-hand account of it is in a sermon delivered December 1, 1912 by Russell H. Conwell, pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Philadelphia.  Rev. Conwell said the little girl’s name was Hattie May Wiatt.  She lived near a church where the Sunday School was very crowded and he told her that one day they would have buildings big enough to allow every one to attend who wanted to.  Later, Hattie May Wiatt became sick and died.  Rev. Conwell was asked to do the funeral and the girl’s mother told him that Hattie May had been saving money to help build a bigger church and gave him the little purse in which she had saved 57 cents.  Rev. Conwell had the 57 cents turned into 57 pennies, told the congregation the story of little Hattie May and sold the pennies for a return of about $250.  In addition, 54 of the original 57 pennies were returned to Rev. Conwell and he later put them up on display.  This was in 1886 when 57 cents was no small savings account for a little girl from a poor family.  Some of the members of the church formed what they called the Wiatt Mite Society which was dedicated to making Hattie May’s 57 cents grow as much as possible and to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school.  A house nearby was purchased with the $250 that Hattie May’s 57 cents had produced and the rest is history.  The first classes of Temple College, later Temple University, were held in that house.  It was later sold to allow Temple College to move and the growth of Temple, along with the founding of the Good Samaritan Hospital (Now the Temple University Hospital) have been powerful testimonies to Hattie May Wiatt’s dream.

"Islam in California Schools-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/byronislam/"," The message says “Public Schools Embrace Islam – A Shocker.”  It focuses on seventh graders in Byron, California, and says that although students in a growing number of public schools cannot wear crosses or utter the name of Jesus, they are being required to attend an intensive three-week course on Islam including mandated study of the tenets of Islam, the important people of Islam, wearing of a robe, adopting a Moslem name, and staging their own Jihad.  It says that the California-required course uses a textbook that says a lot more about Islam than about Christianity and quotes a teacher who says she couldn’t teach Christianity like that and can’t even say the name of Jesus in the classroom, but the seventh graders are learning how to pray to Allah. "," This eRumor has been explosive, both in terms of how quickly it grew in circulation on the Internet and the reaction it prompted. It is based on an article written for the ASSIST News Service by Austin Miles, who is described as a chaplain, author, historian, speaker, educator, and veteran master of ceremonies at various events around the country (he was a circus ringmaster). Highlighting concerns over activities in a class about Islam in Excelsior Middle School, the article suggests that the State of California has “embraced Islam,” that a course on Islam has been “stealthily” slipped into the seventh grade statewide, that the course is mandated as are activities such as wearing Islamic garb, adopting a Moslem name, and stating their own Jihad.  The article also leaves the impression that students and teachers are not allowed to utter the name of Jesus in a classroom and that students cannot wear crosses. Miles interviewed Christina Lemings, a parent of a seventh grader who is also a seventh grade teacher in the Byron Union School District in Contra Costa County, in Northern California.  She said that she did not know what was being taught in the class on Islam until her son brought home a flyer from the Excelsior School about it.  She told Miles, “they teach Islam as the true religion, and students are taught about Islam and to pray to Allah.”  The article says she has quickly learned that in public school, God and Christianity are out (forbidden) but that Islam is in. At question is what actually happened in the classes about Islam at Excelsior school and to what extent, as the article suggests, are these activities mandated statewide? If the children were taught to pray to Allah or to participate in any other Islamic devotional activities, that is an outrage deserving of the protest of parents and other concerned Californians. Lemings says there was prayer to Allah in the class.  Other news reports have said that the children were required to pray “in the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful” and to stage their own Jihad.  Nancie Castro, the principle at the middle school, denies the children were taught to pray or that any of the children was required to participate in the cultural activities of wearing Middle-Eastern clothing or choosing a Moslem name. She told the Contra Costa Times that wearing the clothing was something offered for extra credit. The American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia has written a letter to the Byron School district demanding that parents be given the chance to choose whether their children participate in the required course on Islam. Castro says that  when the flyers about the course were sent to parents, three families asked that their children be exempted from that particular portion of the studies and they were given alternate assignments. Peggy Green, the Superintendent of the Byron Union School district says that the school is merely reflecting the California guidelines for seventh grade and that the students are learning about Islam in the same way that they learn about Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and other major religions.  She says that individual teachers will augment the curriculum with various activities and games, including dressing-up and role playing, in order to stimulate class discussion.  Green did not specifically say whether there had been prayers to Allah or any other devotional activities encouraged by the teacher at Byron.  Green says she and her staff have been fielding calls and other messages to the school about the controversy, many of which have been malignant and threatening. Lemings, the teacher interviewed by Miles, says she has been troubled by the nature and content of some of the complaints to the school and issued a statement on January 15 saying, “Our schools have wonderful people teaching our children who are walking a fine line trying to comply with their state’s regulations, a vague understanding of the separation of church and state and the possibility of a lawsuit on any given day.”  She said she heard some of the recorded messages directed at her principal and school and was ashamed of them and reminded people that the protest was against decisions at the state level and that her concern was over the way the textbook had handled these issues. Educators with whom TruthOrFiction.com has spoken, however,  say that they feel that the article sensationalized the issue and included some misinformation.  It left the impression that this new class on Islam had been “slipped” into California public schools and that the state was mandating activities such as had been described as happening in the Byron School District. Forrest Turpen is  the Executive Director of the Christian Educator’s Association International (www.ceai.org).  It is a Christian group committed to educators and educational issues in public schools.  Turpin says the teaching about Islam has not been “slipped” into the curriculum.  Islam has been an important part of history, and therefore an important part of studying history for a long time and is a part of the state guidelines for seventh graders just as teaching about Christianity is a part of the educational guidelines for 6th graders.  That is the reason, according to Turpin, why the textbook “Across the Centuries” deals with Islam more than Christianity.  It’s a seventh grade text and that is the grade when Islam is studied. “In fact,” says Turpin, “the state of California has been a leader in requiring a balance of teaching about who we are and what has empowered us as a civilization.” Tom Adams, the administrator for curriculum framework at the state education department, told the Contra Costa Times that state guidelines (for seventh grade) do include a unit on Islamic civilization in the medieval world, however, it should be an academic approach on the historical significance of the religion. It should not be construed as an endorsement of it. How the guidelines are implemented in the classroom is largely up to the teacher and critics say that in many classrooms, Islam has been emphasized while other religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, have sometimes been hardly touched upon.  In an article on WorldNetDaily.com, Diana Lynne said that other parents in California have reported Islam-related activities that have caused them concern.  One parent says her daughter was indoctrinated about Islam for four months while in seventh grade in Elk Grove, California.  She said one day, she arrived at school to find a banner in front that said “There is one God, Allah, and Mohammad is his prophet.”   She says she had also seen children chanting from the Koran and praying. TruthOrFiction.com also reviewed the portions of the textbook “Across the Centuries” that deal with Islam.  The text does present Islam in a positive way, which critics say ignores some of the aspects of Islamic history that aren’t so positive, especially violent conquest. Another complaint about the text is that it treats the claims of Islam as “fact.”  TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed the disputed passages and found that most of them, with a couple of exceptions, are attributed in some way to Moslem belief, rather than stated fact.  Several of the disputed passages that are being passed around the Internet are from a section in the text that is under the umbrella title “The Teachings of Islam.”  Many of the sentences in that section have no attribution because they are already being presented as Islamic belief. There is protest from some parents about the suggested student activities in the textbook such as imaging being a Muslim soldier on the way to conquer Syria and journaling thoughts about Islam and being in battle; building a miniature mosque as a class activity; writing about a journey to Mecca; Contemplating why Islam was so attractive to Arabs and others in Southwest Asia.  One veteran teacher told TruthOrFiction.com, however, that those kinds of suggested activities are commonly used by teachers and that he doesn’t view them as being in the book in order to favor Islam.  He said that there are similar suggestions in the sixth grade textbook including having the students discuss what role the Israelite’s relationship with God played in the formation of their nation, explaining the covenant that the Israelites made with God, imagining being with the Jews when they were conquered by the Babylonians and forced into exile, discussing how Judaism and Christianity are related, how the teachings of Jesus were similar or different from those of other Jews, and doing a presentation of the differences of the religious views of the Sadducees and the Pharisees.
