"Michigan Recount Reveals Voter Fraud in Detroit-Unproven!","2016-12-15 13:36:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michigan-recount-reveals-voter-fraud-detroit/"," A 2016 election recount in Michigan requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein has uncovered voter fraud in Detroit and Wayne County, Michigan. "," Discrepancies in the number of ballots and recorded votes in Detroit and Wayne County have sparked an official audit — but state officials haven’t yet ruled whether or not there was voter fraud in Detroit. The story began to unfold in early December when the Detroit News reported that as many as half the votes in Wayne County , which includes Detroit, could be ineligible for recount under state law because of problems with ballots: “It’s not good,” conceded Daniel Baxter, elections director for the city of Detroit. He blamed the discrepancies on the city’s decade-old voting machines, saying 87 optical scanners broke on Election Day. Many jammed when voters fed ballots into scanners, which can result in erroneous vote counts if ballots are inserted multiple times. Poll workers are supposed to adjust counters to reflect a single vote but in many cases failed to do so, causing the discrepancies, Baxter said. Even so, Baxter said it’s unlikely all 392 of the city’s precincts with mismatched numbers will be disqualified from a recount. The city is in contact with elections officials at the state of Michigan and Baxter predicted the numbers will match when the ballot boxes are re-opened for the recount, which starts Tuesday in Wayne County at Cobo Center. “It’s a challenge, but we’re confident the ballots will match,” Baxter said. “I don’t think it’s going to be 100 percent, but it never is with a recount.” Then, a report about votes in Wayne County released by election officials on December 13th sparked even more questions about alleged voter fraud in Detroit, Detroit News reports: The new report, compiled by Wayne County elections officials, sheds light on the extent of the problems and shows a systematic tendency toward counting more votes than the previous Wayne County report, which didn’t specify if precincts had over-counted or undercounted ballots. Republican state senators last week called for an investigation in Wayne County, including one precinct where a Detroit ballot box contained only 50 of the 306 ballots listed in a poll book, according to an observer for Trump. City officials have told state officials that ballots in that precinct were never taken out of a locked bin below the voting machine tabulator on Election Day, said Secretary of State spokesman Fred Woodhams. “That’s what we’ve been told, and we’ll be wanting to verify it,” Woodhams said. “At any rate, this should not have happened.” The state is not calling the audit an investigation, “but based on what we find, it could lead to more,” he said. So, while some have pointed to decades-old voting machines that broke down on election day, others have made accusations about voter fraud in Detroit. At this time, it’s not clear why the vote numbers are off, or by how much, Detroit News reports: It’s unclear how many votes were added in Detroit. That’s because county officials have not tabulated how much the ballots were off in precincts with discrepancies of at least five votes. Of the data available, though, machines tallied at least 388 more ballots, according to a Detroit News analysis of the records. That’s 0.16 percent of the 248,000 ballots cast in the city that voted for Clinton 95 percent to 3 percent over Trump. Haroutunian said she didn’t know what to make of the trend toward over-counting because there was no explanation from Detroit poll workers. The city had another 34 precincts that were out of balance, but they included explanations for the discrepancies. The partial Michigan recount did not change the result of the election: Donald Trump won Michigan by more than 10,000 votes. But Hillary Clinton picked up about 100 votes through the recount, the Detroit Free Press reports: Nearly 2.1 million of the close to 4.8 million ballots cast in Michigan in the Nov. 8 presidential election were counted a second time before the recount was halted, with Democrat Hillary Clinton gaining 102 votes and Stein gaining 64 votes, according to data released by the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office. Since the recount was not completed, the official result will remain as  stated earlier, with Trump defeating Clinton by 10,704 votes. Chris Thomas, Michigan’s elections director, said those numbers show Michigan residents can have a high level of confidence in the state’s election system. “I would view this very positively — the fact that we counted … 2 million votes and the net difference was 102 votes,” Thomas said. But those tallies don’t include the votes in question in Detroit because they were excluded from the recount under state law. It’s not clear how much the vote total in Detroit, why the total count was off, or if there was actually voter fraud in Detroit. An official audit should provide answers. Check back for updates.

"Maureen Dowd: Election Therapy from My Basket of Deplorables-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-12-13 12:58:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/maureen-dowd-election-therapy-basket-deplorables/"," New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd penned a column under the headline, “Election Therapy from My Basket of Deplorables,” after Donald Trump won the 2016 election. "," The New York Times published Maureen Down’s “Election Therapy form My Basket of Deplorables” column on Nov. 26, 2016. The column begins by describing a sit-down between Times reporters and editors and President-elect Trump: Sitting next to our publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., Trump invited everyone around the table to call him if they saw anything “where you feel that I’m wrong.” “You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear,” he said. “The only one who can’t call me is Maureen. She treats me too rough.” Then I had to go home for Thanksgiving and deal with my family scolding me about the media misreading the country. I went cold turkey to eat hot turkey: no therapy dog, no weaving therapy, no yoga, no acupuncture, no meditation, no cry-in. Dowd describes her conservative family in the column as “my little basked of deplorables,” which gave rise to the “Election Therapy” headline, and describes how the election was a repudiation of President Obama and his “fantasy world” of political correctness: The country had signaled strongly in the last two midterms that they were not happy. The Dems’ answer was to give them more of the same from a person they did not like or trust. Preaching — and pandering — with a message of inclusion, the Democrats have instead become a party where incivility and bad manners are taken for granted, rudeness is routine, religion is mocked and there is absolutely no respect for a differing opinion. This did not go down well in the Midwest, where Trump flipped three blue states and 44 electoral votes. The rudeness reached its peak when Vice President-elect Mike Pence was booed by attendees of “Hamilton” and then pompously lectured by the cast. This may play well with the New York theater crowd but is considered boorish and unacceptable by those of us taught to respect the office of the president and vice president, if not the occupants. Dowd went on to caution “Trump deniers” that crying and whining is not good preparation for the coming storm, and “liberal media” has lost all credibility: The media’s criticism of Trump’s high-level picks as “not diverse enough” or “too white and male” — a day before he named two women and offered a cabinet position to an African-American — magnified this fact. Here is a final word to my Democratic friends. The election is over. There will not be a do-over. So let me bid farewell to Al Sharpton, Ben Rhodes and the Clintons. Note to Cher, Barbra, Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham: Your plane is waiting. And to Jon Stewart, who talked about moving to another planet: Your spaceship is waiting. To Bruce Springsteen, Jay Z, Beyoncé and Katy Perry, thanks for the free concerts. And finally, to all the foreign countries that contributed to the Clinton Foundation, there will not be a payoff or a rebate. Dowd’s column was widely circulated in the weeks after its publication in both emails and on discussion forums. As an outspoken liberal, her message seemed to resonate with both Republican voters happy over Trump’s victory and Democratic voters mourning their loss.","Politics"
"Democrats Charge Trump with Treason-Mostly Fiction!","2016-12-13 08:34:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/democrats-charge-trump-treason/"," Democrats have filed treason charges against President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Rudy Giuliani and FBI Director James Comey. "," It’s true that a Democratic super PAC announced plans to file complaints for treason against Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Rudy Giuliani and James Comey — but Democratic lawmakers have not indicated a willingness to do so. The rumor stems from a tweet by Scott Dowrkin, a senior advisor for the Democratic Coalition Against Trump super PAC, that the group intended to file treason complaints against Trump and other GOP leaders on December 12th: Breaking: We are filing complaints for treason tmrw on Trump, McConnell, Giuliani & James Comey. #DworkinReport #TrumpLeaks Russians #AMJoy pic.twitter.com/YsfEapSkbm — Scott Dworkin (@funder) December 11, 2016 That led to misleading headlines from various fringe websites that Democratic lawmakers had themselves filed treason charges against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani and Comey. New Century Times , for example, published a report under the factually incorrect headline , “BREAKING: Democrats File TREASON Charges Against Trump, FBI, Giuliani over Russia.” In reality, the super PAC announced that it would file treason complaints with the FBI accusing Trump, McConnell, Giuliani and Comey of being complicit in Russia’s government hacking DNC officials’ emails and interfering with the 2016 presidential election. That is not the same as Democrats filing treason charges , which is what has been reported. Nobody has actually been charged with treason. And this isn’t the first time that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump super PAC has filed treason complaints against alleged Russian hacks influencing the 2016 election. In July, the group filed a complaint with the FBI accusing Roger Stone and the Trump campaign of being involved in WikiLeaks and assisted the “foreign government” that carried the attacks out, Law Newz reported in July: From the Saturday statement obtained by LawNewz.com: “Stone had fair warning before the most recent emails were released, and predicted back in August that Podesta would be at the center of the next string of hacks.” The group says that cyber-terrorism and treason has likely been committed, and that the FBI should look into it. This isn’t the first time this group has filed a legal complaint against Republicans. In fact, they’ve done it several times this election season. WikiLeaks has recently published several batches of emails purportedly from John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. It’s attracted quite a bit of bad press during an election that was already a raging tire fire. This has international implications, too. The U.S. government has said they believe the Russian government authorized the data dumps. So, while it’s true that a Democratic super PAC has indicated that it would file treason complaints against Trump, McConnell, Giuliani and Comey, it’s not true that Democratic lawmakers have actually charged anyone with treason. That’s why we’re calling this rumor “mostly fiction.” ","Politics"
"Ben Carson: Abortion Causes Baby Ghosts-Reported as Fiction!","2016-12-08 12:51:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ben-carson-abortion-causes-baby-ghosts/"," Ben Carson once said abortions cause baby ghosts that haunt hospitals. "," We couldn’t find any record of Ben Carson saying that abortions cause baby ghosts, and this appears to be satire confused as factual news. Ben Carson’s supposed comment about abortions causing baby ghosts began to circulate on social media in a meme back in 2015 while he was a GOP presidential candidate. The meme, which showed these words next to an image of Carson, doesn’t cite a source: “Abortions create baby ghosts which haunted the hospitals the abortion was performed in. The baby ghosts then steal medical supplies, which is what drives up medical costs. I know this because I’m a doctor.” The original source of the meme isn’t clear, either. But hundreds of Ben Carson memes have circulated over the election cycle; many of them complete works of fiction. This meme went viral after President-elect Donald Trump named Carson to serve as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And Ben Carson was an outspoken critic of abortion during the presidential campaign, but we couldn’t find any quotes in which Carson said abortion causes baby ghosts to haunt hospitals and steal medical supplies. Given all that, we’re reporting this one as fiction.","Politics"
"Pizzagate Pedophilia Conspiracy Theory-Unproven!","2016-12-07 09:30:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pizzagate-child-sex-ring-conspiracy-theory/"," John Podesta, Hillary Clinton and other top Democrats have been involved in a child sex trafficking ring operated through Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in a scandal that has become known as “Pizzagate.” "," Pizzagate is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. No evidence has been produced to back up claims that a pedophilia ring was run out of Comet Ping Pong, or that John Podesta or Hillary Clinton were involved in child sex trafficking. These conspiracy theories began building toward the end of October when FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI was reviewing new evidence into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Reports surfaced that the “new evidence” was found on a laptop used by Huma Adedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who was under investigation for allegedly sending sexually graphic images to a teen. Online sleuths immediately began circulating reports on social that cited unnamed sources within the NYPD that Abedin’s emails pointed to a pedophila ring that Hillary Clinton was at the center of: In the coming days, posts citing unnamed NYPD and FBI sources popped up on message boards and discussion forums like 4chan and Godlike Productions. Those threads found a larger audience when fake news and conspiracy websites began citing them in reports claiming that Clinton and Podesta emails had been linked to a “political pedophile sex ring.” We debunked a variation of Pizzagate that can be found here. In turn, the threads that started the rumor began citing these false reports as proof that their conspiracy theories were right. As the pedophilia sex trafficking ring theory gained momentum, people began scanning John Podesta’s lead emails for any proof to back up their claims. Given that there was none to be found, commenters on 4chan and Reddit sub-groups began to theorize that he had spoken in code to cover his tracks, giving rise to the idea that he had used “pizza” as a code word for pedophilia or child sex trafficking — and the Pizzagate conspiracy theory was born. As it turns out, John Podesta and other Democratic operatives eat (and sent and received emails about) pizza a lot. People milling through Podesta’s emails would take a seemingly harmless email like this one , and claim that he had swapped “pizza” for “pedophilia”: Wanted to flag a dinner I’m doing at my house tomorrow for Hillary. Doing a fundraiser at my house with my brother John on October 6 at my house, John and I are cooking along with guest chefs James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong Pizza and Buck’s Camping and Fishing, Amy Brandwein of Centrolina and Massimo Fabbri of Ristorante Posto. Would love if you could go online and make your contribution… Again, there’s no proof whatsoever that the email refers to child sex trafficking, but those conspiracy theories, and no law enforcement officials have confirmed anything of the like. Still, those conspiracy theories continue to this day. The Pizzagate story took on an even darker twist when an armed North Carolina men took a gun into Comet Ping Pong to “self-investigate” and rescue child victims of assault from the pizzeria, NBC News reports : Edgar Welch, 28, was arraigned Monday on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and other crimes, the documents say. The documents allege that Welch, whose address is listed 250 miles south, in Durham, N.C., arrived at the pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, armed with an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun just after 3 p.m. to help “rescue” child sex slaves that he believed were possibly being held there. At the pizzeria on Sunday, a worker told police that he was outside when Welch apparently arrived. Identified only as CW-1 in the documents, the worker said that he stepped out to grab pizza dough when he heard three loud bangs coming from inside. “CW-1 re-entered the restaurant and observed a white male holding an AR-15 type rifle,” the documents say, adding that when Welch allegedly swung the rifle towards him he immediately ran outside. Again, there’s no proof whatsoever that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton or anybody else was involved in the Pizzagate pedophilia ring. Those rumors started on social media, made their way into fake news and then took on new life on message boards. Throughout it all, however, no hard evidence has been provided to back it up.

"Obama Hangs Hillary Clinton Portrait in White House-Fiction!","2016-12-06 13:36:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-hangs-hillary-clinton-portrait-in-white-house/"," The Obamas hung a Hillary Clinton portrait in the White House with their Christmas decorations after Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election. "," A portrait of former First Lady Hillary Clinton hangs in the White House’s — but the Obamas didn’t put it there. Rather, the portrait was hung in the White House’s Cross Hall on June 14, 2004, while President George W. Bush was in office. A Getty photo of the unveiling ceremony for Bill and Hillary Clinton’s portraits shows that both Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were both in attendance. Fast forward to 2016, fringe websites began running with false claims that Barack and Michelle Obama hanged Hillary Clinton’s portrait along with the rest of their Christmas decorations. The source of these reports was a tweet from a special projects director of Donald Trump super Pac Citizens 4 Trump: The tweet is based on a misunderstood blog post about Hillary Clinton’s portrait hanging at the White House that appeared at The Hill : She didn’t win the election, but Hillary Clinton still has a place at the White House — between two snowmen. An official portrait of the former first lady and Democratic presidential nominee is hanging in the Cross Hall of the White House, displayed alongside an array of bells, baubles and other holiday décor.

"Trump Won 3,084 of 3,141 Counties-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-12-02 13:10:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-won-3084-counties/"," President-elect Donald Trump won 3,084 of 3,141 counties in America, and he won the popular vote in America’s heartland by an overwhelming 7.5 million votes. "," Claims that Trump won 3,084 of 3,141 counties are true — but the idea that he won a 7.5 million popular vote landslide “in America’s heartland” is misleading because the most populous counties (most of which went for Hillary Clinton) were intentionally excluded from that tally. The rumor was started by Breitbart , the website formerly run by Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, on November 16th. The article reports that Trump won a “7.5 million popular vote landslide” in America’s heartland: Donald Trump won an overwhelming 7.5 million popular vote victory in 3,084 of the country’s 3,141 counties or county equivalents in America’s heartland. Fifty-five point seven million out of the 109.3 million Americans who cast their ballots in those counties voted for Trump, while only 48.1 million voted for Hillary Clinton, according to the latest county by county election results reported at Politico. The remaining 5.4 million voted for other candidates. County-by-county breakdowns of 2016 election returns show that Donald Trump won 3,084 counties — but many of them were rural and sparsely populated. A map that Breitbart published with its story showed the vast majority of the country colored red for Trump — but it failed to take into account the distribution of voters. The University of Michigan created this graphic to demonstrate county-by-county returns based on population density, not geography: The point is that election results are based on the sizes of populations, not geographical locations. And, as the Telegraph notes , the same number of ballots were cast in 163 counties (123 of which Hillary Clinton won) as in the remaining 2,939 counties in the United States. So, the claim that Trump won 3,084 counties, or a 7.5 million popular vote landslide in those areas, doesn’t take into account how many voters were in those counties: This “heartland” they refer to is the vast areas of red on the US election results map, which is predominately rural and Republican-leaning. The key thing Breitbart miss is that while this covers a lot of land area, the actual number of voters in these counties is small, as these rural areas have lower population densities. If we look at all the counties together and divide them straight down the main dividing line — red for Trump and blue for Clinton, as the map that Breitbart copied from the University of Michigan does — the sea of red is clear to see. America’s rural areas, which take up the majority of the country’s geography but are home to fewer people than its cities, overwhelmingly backed Trump and therefore colour the majority of the country in red. But if we take the 3,102 counties in America — excluding Alaska which doesn’t count its presidential results by county — and look at the number of votes cast in them, it quickly becomes apparent that the 163 most populous counties have exactly the same amount of voter power behind them as the 2,939 least populous — most of which backed the Republican. This means that the same number of ballots were cast in the 163 counties that Brietbart dismisses – of which 123 voted for Clinton and 40 backed Trump – than in the other 2,939. So, it’s true that Trump won 3,084 of 3,141 counties — but that doesn’t take into account population distribution. That’s why we’re calling this one misleading. ","Politics"
"25th Amendment Could End Trump Presidency-Truth!","2016-12-01 08:32:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/25th-amendment-end-trump-presidency/"," Congress could use a little known provision of the 25th Amendment to prevent Donald Trump from taking office, or to cut his term in office short, by declaring him “unfit” for the presidency. "," It’s true that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet or Congress could exercise a section of the 25th amendment to declare him unable to discharge his duties and effectively end his presidency. The Hill first reported on the 25th Amendment ending a (then potential) Trump presidency back in August after he appeared to encourage Russian hackers to steal emails from Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state: The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, as a clarification to Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution. The 25th Amendment deals with the succession of the Presidency, especially at a time when the sitting President becomes unable, incapable or unfit to perform the duties of his or her office. It also establishes procedures to fill a vacancy left by the Vice President. It is essentially a safeguard against a president who runs amuck, or who goes insane, or who cannot fulfill his or her duties as commander and chief and leader of the union of 50 states. Specifically, Article II, Section IV of the 25th Amendmen t outlines a process for “a majority of executive departments” or “such other body as Congress” could basically declare the president unfit to hold office: Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. Under that scenario, the president could then submit in writing to Congress that “no inability exists” and “he shall resume the powers and duties of his office” unless “principal officers of the executive department” submit a written declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. Then, Congress would have the last say on the issue: Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office. So, it’s true that Trump’s cabinet or Congress could cut short his time in office by declaring him unfit to discharge his duties. However, claims that the 25th Amendment could prevent a Trump presidency from happening at all seem shaky given that the 25th Amendment refers only to a sitting president, not a president-elect.

"Thousands of Trump Votes Erased in Wisconsin-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-28 12:36:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/thousands-of-trump-votes-stricken-in-wisconsin/"," Before an official recount even began in Wisconsin, 25,000 fake votes for Donald Trump were wiped out because “they apparently never existed to begin with.” There were more votes than registered voters in at least five precincts in Wisconsin in the 2016 election, igniting speculation of widespread voter fraud. "," Mostly false or misleading reports about voter fraud in Wisconsin began swirling ahead of an official recount in the state triggered by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Stein crowd-sourced money needed to pay for an official recount in Wisconsin, and she vowed to sue after state officials denied her request to conduct an official recount by hand. That back-and-forth opened up plenty of room for speculation and rumors about election fraud in a state that President-elect Donald Trump shocked the nation by winning. As tempers flared, a rumor circulated that 5,000 or 25,000 Trump votes (depending on the version) had been stricken because they “never existed” in the first place. And a related rumor began circulating that there were more votes than voters in at least five precincts in Wisconsin, signaling widespread voter fraud. These rumors appear to stem from what has been described as “human error” leading to inaccurate unofficial vote totals in five precincts in Outagamie County. However, the mistake was caught, and the vote totals were adjusted, before a board of canvassers certified the state’s official results. That means claims that 5,000 or 25,000 votes for Trump had already been stricken from Wisconsin’s official vote totals before the recount began are false. The inaccurate vote totals were caught before the official results were certified, meaning the official vote tally remains unchanged. Lynn Mischker, the village clerk of Hortonville, explained the discrepancy in a statement to an ABC affiliate in Wisconsin: “In order to give election returns to the Outagamie County Clerk’s office as quickly as possible the Chief Inspector added together the votes from the election machine tapes. An error was made while keying the numbers on the calculator during this process resulting in an incorrect number of votes reported on Election night. The official process of tallying the votes was completed and rechecked. These vote numbers were recorded and delivered to the Outagamie County Clerk’s office the morning of November 9th. The official tally reflects the accurate votes in the Village.” Outagamie County Clerk Lori O’Bright explained that human error sometimes occurs in rural areas where totals are tabulated by hand and phoned in from area polling locations, which is why a board of canvassers reviews the results before they’re certified: “The canvass is conducted by county clerks throughout the state. We are on the partisan ticket so our canvass also has to have a member of the opposite party on the canvass, along with another member. So, it is reviewed as fairly as possible.” So, despite rumors that 5,000 or 25,000 Trump votes have already been erased, official vote totals from Outagamie County had not changed since the results were certified.

"The Buffet Rule and the Congressional Reform Act of 2017-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-22 08:06:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/buffet-rule/"," A chain email that has been in circulation since at least 2011 discusses Warren Buffet’s five-minute plan, known as the “The Buffet Rule,” to fix Congress for good. Tho "," During a 2011 interview, Warren Buffet said he could end the federal deficit and fix Congress in less than five minutes using what has become known as “The Buffet Rule” — but Buffet’s reps later said he wasn’t making a serious policy proposal. Buffet made the comment that gave rise to “The Buffet Rule” email during an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick. And the comment has since been attached to chain emails and blog posts about the Congressional Reform Act. Recently, the Buffet Rule has begun trending again with claims about the Congressional Reform Act of 2017 (more on that later). The exchange came during a discussion about the federal deficit and congressional turmoil as Democrats and Republicans faced a budget standoff that later resulted in the federal government temporarily shutting down: BUFFETT: And that’s a real question and the question is whether you’re better off making decisions on those things at the point of a gun or whether there’s enough maturity in a Congress that they face this, just like they faced 120 percent debt of GDP back after World War II. You know, we’ve got… BECKY: But these problems — these problems aren’t new. These problems aren’t problems that have built up over decades and there hasn’t been a Congress that’s been mature enough or a president that’s been mature enough to take this head on. BUFFETT: I can — I can— I can end the deficit in five minutes. BECKY: How? BUFFETT: You just pass a law that says that any time there’s a deficit of more than 3 percent of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election. Yeah. Yeah. Now you’ve got the incentives in the right place, right? So it’s capable of being done. And they’re trying to use the incentive now we’re going to blow your brains out, America, you know, in terms of your— of your— in terms of your debt worthiness over time, and that’s being used as a threat. A more effective threat would be just to say if you guys can’t get it done, we’ll get some other guys to get it down. And incidentally, we had— we had Simpson-Bowles, you know, almost eight or 10 months ago. Buffet’s “proposal” to pass a law that says sitting members of Congress can’t seek reelection if the federal deficit is more than 3 percent of GDP immediately went viral. It appears that Buffets quote, or at least a version of Buffet’s quote, was attached to the beginning of a chain email about the 2011 Congressional Reform Act that was already in widespread circulation. However, a representative from Buffet’s Berkshire-Hathaway company later told the Wall Street Journal in an email that Buffet had proposed the “Buffet Rule” to prove a point about the effectiveness good incentives — not to make a serious policy proposal: In an email, a Berkshire spokeswoman said that the company has heard from quite a few people who have received the chain letter, but that (and this is a shocker) Buffett had never suggested someone start one. In fact, the spokeswoman wrote that he never even meant it as a serious proposal and just wanted to emphasize the importance of proper incentives. And CNBC later updated a story on Quick’s interview with Buffet to clarify that his proposal would be extremely difficult to carry out because the very people who would lose their jobs because of it (congressmen) would be the ones who’d have to approve it: An attorney in St. Louis, Jarrad Holst, points out by email that there is a way to enact Buffett’s idea without the cooperation of Congress. Under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, a “Convention for proposing Amendments” is convened when called for by the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. A proposed amendment would then need to be ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the states. If that happens, and it is a very, very big if, Buffett’s deficit plan would become the law of the land. That process would, however, take more than five minutes. And we thoroughly investigated the email’s specific claims about the Congressional Reform Act back in 2011 and found every one of them to be “fiction.” You can read our entire report here. By the end of 2016, however, the rumor was circulating yet again. This time, the exact same points were being attached to the so-called Congressional Reform Act of 2017. So, although emails about the Buffet Rule and the Congressional Reform Act go viral at the beginning of each year, they’re all based on the same claims that are “mostly fiction.” ","Politics"
"Monica Petersen Dies While Investigating Clinton Human Trafficking in Haiti-Unproven!","2016-11-18 12:03:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/monica-petersen-dies-investigating-clinton-human-trafficking-haiti/"," Monica Petersen, a woman working on behalf of the Human Trafficking Center, died in Haiti while investigating a possible human trafficking ring tied to the Clinton Foundation. "," The Human Trafficking Center announced that Monica Petersen died in Haiti on November 13th; however, no cause of death was reported, and it’s not clear that Petersen was actually investigating a human trafficking ring involving the Clinton Foundation. Those rumors began circulating on social media and Reddit shortly after the Human Trafficking Center announced on Facebook that Petersen had died in Haiti without providing further details about her death: Conspiracy theorists began to fill in the blanks, and people commenting on social media posts who claimed to know Petersen fueled the flames by commenting that they’d heard she’d died of an apparent suicide or had been murdered. When asked to provide more details to settle the speculation, Human Trafficking Center replied that it was best to ignore them: Speculation about Petersen’s death, and the Clinton’s alleged involvement, has become the latest chapter in the “Clinton body count” conspiracy theory. The theory goes that Bill and Hillary Clinton have systematically murdered foes, friends and allies that have jeopardized their political fortunes over the decade. Click here for our full investigation of it. When it comes to Petersen, Reddit users have pointed to a Facebook post in which she appeared to be critical of the Clintons’ dealings in Haiti. She lamented the Clintons dismantling Haiti with their “gold looting” after the 2010 earth quake and added, “Ms. Clinton has corrupt & dirty business to finish in Haiti.” It should be noted that Petersen was commenting on a blog post that was critical of the Clintons, but she didn’t actually write the post. The Reddit thread has falsely attributed the actual blog post to Petersen. A s econd Facebook post from Petersen in August 2016 established that she was going to be Haiti for “the next 3 weeks” doing fieldwork on human trafficking. Petersen didn’t offer specifics, but she was looking for “sex work organizations” there to help her. Taken together, those posts have been used to establish that Petersen disliked the Clintons, and that she was doing human trafficking fieldwork in Haiti in August. From there, conspiracy theorists have connected the dots by claiming that Petersen was killed by the Clintons because her work in Haiti had revealed the Clinton Foundation’s role in a human trafficking sex ring there — which is quite a jump. This rumor is unproven because it’s not clear how Petersen died, there’s no proof that she was actually investigating the Clinton Foundation, and there’s no proof that the Clinton Foundation has been involved in human trafficking in Haiti.

"Ford Moves Manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio after Trump Win-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-17 08:08:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ford-moves-manufacturing-mexico-ohio-trump-win/"," After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Ford Motor Company announced that it would move its manufacturing operations from Mexico to Ohio. "," Ford has shifted production of some of its trucks from Mexico to Ohio — but the change happened in August 2015, more than a year before Donald Trump was elected president. Various websites re-reported the story to make it appear that Trump’s election had led to Ford shifting production of its full-size F-650 and F-750 trucks from Mexico to a plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. The site Viral Liberty , for example, re-reported the 2015 story under the headline, “Trump Wins the Presidency & Ford Shifts Truck Production from Mexico to Ohio.” However, large portions of that story were lifted from an August 2015 report filed by CNN Money Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. …”Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” But although Ford’s decision to move some of its truck production from Mexico to Ohio didn’t have anything to do with Trump being elected president — Trump was a vocal critic of Ford’s $2.5 billion investment in Mexico back in 2015, and he was credited at the time for shedding light on the issue, the Detroit News reports : Trump, who announced his plans to run at an appearance in New York on Tuesday, vowed to impose 35 percent taxes on imported Ford vehicles and parts coming from the new Mexican plant. Trump said he would call Ford CEO Mark Fields — whom he identified only as “the head of Ford” — to explain the “bad news.” “Let me give you the bad news: every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax — OK? — and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction,” Trump said. “They are going to take away thousands of jobs.” The good news ends there, however. After Trump’s election, Fields said the company would continue its plans to move some of its manufacturing operations to Mexico despite threats by President-elect Trump to impose tariffs, BBC reports : But the Ford boss said a levy on car imports would hurt the US economy. “A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector that could have a major impact on the US economy,” Mr Fields told reporters at the Los Angeles auto show. “I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy,” he said. Ford has previously said it would shift production of its US-produced Focus and C-Max models to a new facility in Mexico by 2018. Mr Fields said on Tuesday it was moving the Focus to make room for two new products in Michigan. He also expressed support for free trade deals like Nafta, echoing comments from BMW chief executive Harald Krueger last week. Given that a 2015 story was re-reported as breaking news after Trump was elected in 2016, and that Ford has said it will continue on with plans to move some manufacturing to Mexico despite Trump’s election, we’re calling this one “fiction.” ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Had Drunken Meltdown after Election Loss-Unproven!","2016-11-16 12:44:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-drunken-meltdown-election-loss-unproven/"," After her surprising upset loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton had a meltdown and became physically abusive toward her staff. "," There aren’t any credible sources to back up rumor that Hillary Clinton became physically abusive to her staff, or had a drunken meltdown, as it became clear that she would lose the election to Donald Trump. What’s more, the source of the rumor was a Twitter agitator named Todd Kincannon who has since been banned from the social media platform: Kincannon tweeted, “CNN reporter tells me Hillary became physically violent towards Robby Mook and John Podesta around midnight; had to be briefly restrained.” Later, when asked about Clinton being drunk, Kincannon replied, “She was. I posted about that too. She was in a ‘psychotic drunken rage’ according to my reporter friend. Doctor added sedatives to the mix.” The rumor went viral after InfoWars , the conspiracy driven site operated by Alex Jones. The story was quickly shared on social media nearly 50,000 times. Rumors about Clinton having meltdowns, throwing tantrums or being physically abusive to her staff aren’t uncommon. Earlier this year, we investigated an almost identical rumor that Clinton became enraged after Matt Lauer interviewed her during the presidential forum and threw a glass at a staffer’s head. Again, the story was un-sourced and couldn’t be proven. Click here to read the full story. Also, former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne wrote that Clinton was prone to angry outbursts and fits of anger in his 2016 book “Crisis of Character.” Given that Byrne served as an officer in the West Wing during the Clinton administration, claims made in the book have been taken more seriously. However, the nonpartisan Association of Former Agents of the U.S. Secret Services “strongly denounced” the book and said in a statement that Byrne had “underlying motives” in writing it. So, just like all the previous ones, the latest rumor about Hillary Clinton threw a tantrum, had an angry meltdown or became physically abusive to staff is unproven. ","Politics"
"3 Million Non-Citizens Voted in 2016 Election-Unproven!","2016-11-16 12:04:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/3-million-non-citizens-voted-2016-election/"," Rumors that non-citizens cast 3 million illegal votes in the 2016 general election have spread across social media. "," Claims that 3 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election can’t be proven true or false at this point. Gregg Phillips, the founder of an app called VoteStand that enables users to report voter fraud, started the rumor on social media. Phillips tweeted that he’d determined the number of non-citizen votes exceeded 3 million after reviewing a database of 180 million voter registrations: Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team. — Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 11, 2016 Later, Phillips promised his followers that he would team up with True the Vote, an organization that identifies itself as a “nonpartisan, voters’ rights and election integrity organization,” to file a lawsuit in federal court regarding the 3 million illegal votes. No additional details have been made available. The first question that comes to mind is the number of registered voters that Phillips claims he reviewed. In the 2016 election, only 146.3 million people were registered to vote, and only about 120.3 million of them actually voted, Static Brain reports . Yet, Phillips somehow reviewed 180 million registered voters. The second question is how it would have been logistically possible for Phillips (or anyone else) to analyze 180 million registered voters (if that many existed) in less than a week, and then determine that more than 3 million of them weren’t legal U.S. citizens. In the end, there isn’t enough information available for us to determine if 3 million illegal votes were actually cast in the 2016 election. But the fact that Phillips claims to have reviewed 180 million registered voters despite the fact that there were only 146.3 million registered voters in the country should be considered a red flag.

"Four-Year-old Dies After Anti-Trump Protesters Block Ambulance-Unproven!","2016-11-16 11:23:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/four-year-old-dies-anti-trump-protesters-block-ambulanc/"," A four-year-old child died after anti-Trump protesters blocked an ambulance on its way to a hospital. "," Anti-Trump protesters have blocked streets and highways in cities across the country, but there haven’t been any confirmed reports of protesters intentionally blocking an ambulance, or of a four-year-old dying as a result. Rumors about anti-Trump protesters blocking an ambulance started on social media with a post that supposedly came from an unnamed EMT who posted about it on social media on November 9th: A few days later, right wing news sites seized on the post and reported it as fact. However, none of those reports cited official police sources, or reported which city it supposedly happened in, and we couldn’t find any local news reports about protesters blocking an ambulance. But Anti-Trump protesters have blocked a number of roadways across the country. In Minneapolis, protesters shut down the heavily trafficked Interstate 94 on November 11th, but the Star-Tribune reports , “They eventually left the freeway via Cedar Avenenue… No one was hurt, and no one was arrested.” Similarly, protesters temporarily closed roadways in Portland , where nobody was arrested, and in Los Angeles, were about 28 people were arrested for refusing to move, Southern California Public Radio reports : When the crowd did move onto the freeway, the LAPD and the California Highway Patrol issued an order to disperse and eventually began arresting anyone who failed to comply, Ramirez said. Photos from the scene showed officers in full tactical gear, with protesters squaring off against police. About 28 people were arrested. Ramirez said people have the right to protest, as long as it doesn’t harm anyone else or threaten public safety. So, although there have been reports of anti-Trump protesters blocking roadways, there haven’t been any reports of protesters blocking ambulances. In fact, this could be a variation of an earlier rumor that went viral in July 2016. When Black Lives Matter protesters shut down the I-40 Bridge in Memphis, Tennessee, it was reported that a child on the way to the hospital for a heart transplant died while waiting in traffic. WBTV reported that area hospitals and police had debunked the reports, saying nobody died as a result of the protest. ","Politics"

"," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooya’s comments about Donald Trump and the 2016 presidential election have  been taken out of context. A day after the 2016 presidential election, Nooya appeared at the New York Times Dealbook Conference in Manhattan, and her appearance can be viewed in its entirety here . Bits and pieces of Nooya’s comments have been taken out of context and reframed to make it appear that she was speaking out against Donald Trump’s election, but that’s not necessarily the case. At the start of her appearance, Nooya, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 campaign, was asked how she felt about the results of the election. She replied: Do you have a box of tissues? First of all, I want to congratulate President-elect Donald Trump. Because the election is over, I think we should mourn, for those of us who supported the other side. But we have to come together. Life has to go on. What did I do yesterday? First of all, I had to answer a lot of questions from my daughters, from my employees. They were all in mourning. The question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white, is “are we safe?” Women are asking are we safe? LGBT are asking are we safe? I never thought I would have to answer those questions. So, the first thing we have to do, is to assure everybody in the United States is that they’re safe. Nothing has changed because of this election. What we heard is election talk. We will all come together and unify the country. The process of democracy happened, but we have to go on. Later, the moderator said Trump has used some “coarse language” about women, and he noted that Pepsi is a sponsor of the NFL, which has struggled to address domestic violence issues among its players. Nayoo was asked how those developments might have changed the Pepsi brand or her perspective on public views. She replied: Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare you talk about women that way? … Why do we talk that way about a whole group of citizens that way? I don’t think there’s a place for that kind of language in part of society. Not in locker rooms, not in football player’s homes. Not in any place. If we don’t nip it in the bud, this is going to be a lethal force that’s going to t5ake over society. I think that’s wrong. I hope that in every forum we talk about locker room conversations about women being intolerable …. It’s got to stop. Right-wing and conservative news sites largely took Nooya’s comments out of context and made it appear that she was saying that Trump or his views had to be “nipped in the bud,” when that wasn’t the case. She indirectly condemned comments he made about forcefully grabbing women in a 2010 video, but she never directly condemned Trump. Given all that, we’re calling claims about Pepsi’s CEO speaking out against Trump “misleading.” ","Politics"
"Trump Advisor Steve Bannon is a Racist White Nationalist-Commentary!","2016-11-15 13:51:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-advisor-steve-bannon-racist-white-nationalist-commentary/"," After President-elect Donald Trump named former Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon as his top advisor, accusations that Bannon is a racist who maintains white nationalist views came to the fore. "," Questions about Steve Bannon’s personal views, and whether or not they’re racist, cannot easily be categorized as truth or fiction. So, we’re going to classify this one as “commentary,” and provide a little background information about Bannon. We’ll also shed a little light on accusations that Bannon is racist, white nationalist. Bannon, a former Naval officer and investment banker at Goldman Sachs, jumped into the world of politics and media by producing and directing a number of hard-right conservative moves like “Undefeated,” a 2011 documentary about Sarah Palin, the 2004 documentary “In the Face Face of Evil: Reagan’s War in Word and Deed,” and “Battle for America,” a 2010 documentary about “constitutional conservatives and arrogant, out-of-touch and ever expanding central government.” As Bannon’s documentaries gained notoriety in conservative circles, he began making regular appearances on Sean Hannity’s “Hannity” show on FOX News. During that time, Bannon built a relationship with Breitbart News’s founder Andrew Breitbart and Bannon was named CEO of the conservative news site after Breitbart’s sudden death in 2012 at the the age of 43. Some have pointed to stories that appeared at Breitbart during Bannon’s tenure there as proof that site promoted anti-Semitic, sexist, racist views — while others, namely Newt Gingrich, argues that Bannon can’t be held responsible for everything published there. The Southern Poverty Law Center argued that Bannon “aggressively pushed stories that demonized immigrants and linked minorities to terrorism and crime, regularly published columns by leaders of known hate groups, and published a call to ‘hoist the confederate flag high and with pride’ only two weeks after the Charleston massacre: Before joining the Trump campaign, Bannon oversaw the rise of the Breitbart News Network, which Bannon himself has called “the platform for the alt-right.” The term alt-right is simply a rebranding of traditional white nationalism for the digital age. During Bannon’s tenure, the website enabled the spread of the alt-right’s extremist ideology from fringe internet culture to the presidential campaign trail. “Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Bannon makes a mockery of his first commitment to the American people as president-elect: ‘to bind the wounds of division,’” said SPLC President Richard Cohen. “In Mr. Bannon, he’s tapped a man who has fanned the flames of division by providing a platform for racism, xenophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism. It’s shocking.” Gigrich, meanwhile, fired back by calling accusations about Bannon “baloney,” Politico reports : “Let me just start and say that everybody who is for Donald Trump and everybody who wants Donald Trump to succeed should cue off the mainstream media. If the mainstream media hates something, it’s probably a really good idea,” Gingrich said. “I mean, let’s be clear: They are the mortal opponents of what Trump is trying to achieve.” Ben Shapiro, a former writer for Breitbart wrote at the Daily Wire that he resigned in March “ when it became clear to me that they had decided that loyalty to Donald Trump outweighed loyalty to their own employees, helping Trump smear one of their own reporters,” wrote that Bannon had made the site into a mouthpiece for racist views: Under Bannon’s Leadership, Breitbart Openly Embraced The White Supremacist Alt-Right. Andrew Breitbart despised racism. Truly despised it. He used to brag regularly about helping to integrate his fraternity at Tulane University. He insisted that racial stories be treated with special care to avoid even the whiff of racism. With Bannon embracing Trump, all that changed. Now Breitbart has become the alt-right go-to website, with Yiannopoulos pushing white ethno-nationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness, and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers. Finally, the Daily News reported that Bannon’s ex-wife, Mary Louise Piccard said in a 2007 court declaration, that Bannon raised objections with the school his daughters attended because of the number of Jews that went there: “The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,” Piccard said in her statement signed on June 27, 2007. “He said that he doesn’t like the way they raise their kids to be ‘whiny brats’ and that he didn’t want the girls going to school with Jews,” Piccard wrote. “I told him that there are children who are Jewish at (a competing school), and he asked me what the percentage was. I told him that I didn’t know because it wasn’t an issue for me as I am not raising the girls to be either anti-Semitic or prejudiced against anyone,” she wrote. In a comment to the Guardian , a Bannon spokesperson denied that he ever made those comments: Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, denied on Friday night that he made antisemitic remarks about the private school. “Mr Bannon never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education,” she said. In the end, we’re calling claims about Bannon’s views as “commentary” because they simply can’t be proven to be truth or fiction. ","Politics"
"George Soros, Pro-Clinton Groups Fund Trump Protests-Unproven!","2016-11-14 12:00:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/george-soros-pro-clinton-groups-fund-trump-protests/"," It’s been rumored that George Soros and pro-Clinton groups funded protests and paid professional protesters after Donald Trump was elected president. "," We haven’t found any proof that George Soros or pro-Clinton groups have funded anti-Trump protests. After Donald Trump’s upset victory in the 2016 election, thousands of Trump protesters were reported in cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland and Philadelphia, CNN reports : Protesters are upset about Trump’s policies on health care, the environment, LGBT rights and other issues. Some are questioning the legitimacy of Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton by noting that although he took the Electoral College, Clinton won the popular vote. Over the weekend, Los Angeles saw anti-Trump protests swell to 8,000 people on Saturday. In New York, thousands peacefully marched two miles on Saturday and gathered outside Trump Tower, the President-elect’s home in Manhattan, where they chanted “not my president.” As protests stretched into a sixth day, rumors persisted that George Soros or pro-Clinton groups were organizing the protests and even paying “professional protesters.” Those rumors are based on a number of theories, and we’ll take a look at few of them. Photos Show Protestors Being Bused into Austin, Texas – Fiction! Photos that appeared to show protestors being bused into Austin have been debunked. A man named Eric Tucker created a stir on social media when he posted multiple photos of charter buses with the caption “Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in.” #fakeprotests The photos quickly went viral. Many pointed to them as proof that Soros (or someone else) had been organizing the anti-Trump protests — going as far as busing in professional protesters from outside the state. However, a FOX affiliate in Austin found that the charter buses were actually being used to shuttle people from hotels to the Tableau Conference being held at the Austin Convention Center. The buses had nothing to do with protests: Before Eric Tucker took the tweet down Friday, it had nearly 17,000 retweets and became part of a national controversy. ”I thought going on Twitter was not a big deal, I thought, I have 40 followers, I post twice a year on Twitter, I’m not a professional blogger at all,” Tucker said. Tucker said seeing a bunch of charter buses lined up on 5th Street near Waller on Wednesday, coincidentally around the same time an anti-Trump rally was being held in downtown Austin he said was unusual. So he took to Twitter with the claims the buses were being used to ship in protesters. “I hadn’t really fact checked at all, it was just all kind of circumstantial and then before I know it, it’s a story, I am over 10,000 tweets by the next day. …But when people started questioning Tuckers claim, so did he. Turns out the buses were being used as hotel shuttles for the Tableau Conference being held at the Austin Convention Center. “Was I wrong in this case, yes I was,” Tucker said. These viral photos don’t actually show protestors being bused in by outside groups. Craigslist Ads Recruit Professional Protestors for $15 Per Hour- Unproven! There’s no way to prove that Craigslist ads that appear to be recruiting professional protesters are real. Craigslist ads are free and easy to create. Someone could easily create a fake ad for professional protestors as a joke, to mislead people into believing that protesters are actually being paid, or to take advantage of people who respond to the post. In a widely circulated Craigslist ad, the Washington Community Action Network (Washington CAN) appeared to be recruiting professional protestors that would be paid $15-$22 per hour. The position even supposedly came with medical, dental and paid time off: Contact information in the ad doesn’t appear to match the contact information listed on the organization’s website. We reached out for comment from a Washington CAN rep and future updates will be posted here. For now we’re calling these claims “unproven.” Leaked Documents from Soros’ Group Point to Paid Protestors-Fiction! Open Society Foundations (OSF), a group that was founded by Soros primarily to help countries transition away from communism, was hacked in June 2016 — but leaked files don’t prove that Soros is behind Trump protests. It appears that Russian hackers stole the documents. They were shared at “DCLeaks,” a site similar to (but not affiliated with) Wikileaks, Bloomberg reports : Open Society Foundations, the Soros group, reported the breach to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in June, said spokeswoman Laura Silber, who added that an investigation by a security firm found the intrusion was limited to an intranet system used by board members, staff and foundation partners. In the case of Soros’s Open Society, hackers stole a trove of documents after accessing the foundation’s internal intranet, a system called Karl, according to a person familiar with its internal investigation. On August 3, the DCLeaks.com Twitter account tweeted “Check George Soros’s OSF plans to counter Russian policy and traditional values,” attaching a screenshot of a $500,000 budget request for an Open Society program designed to counter Russian influence among European democracies. The hackers may have had access the foundations’ network for nearly a year, according to another person familiar with the investigation. Although Open Society has about 800 full-time staff, as many as 7,000 people have access to Karl, which is used to circulate draft program proposals, budgets and other internal documents. The $500,000 budget proposal from Open Society Foundations to help counter Russia’s growing influence in the European Union was among the most notable leaked documents. Included in a “background” section of the proposal was this statement: “Our inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian influence and support to movements defending traditional values.” That statement has been used to argue that Soros’ group has supported and organized protestors to sway public opinion and elections in the past, so he’d likely doing it again in response to Trump’s victory. However, the statement is pretty broad and it’s not clear that “actors” refers to protesters. We’re calling these claims “unproven.” Soros Funded Protests in Ferguson; He’d Do it Again- Misleading! We looked into reports that Soros had paid millions to help protests in Ferguson after a grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in Michael Brown’s death in December 2014. We them to be both true and misleading. At the time, the Washington Times reported that Soros had paid $33 million directly to groups organizing protests in Ferguson. And, while we found that OSF had given $33 million to support community groups involved in the protests, those funds were earmarked for various initiatives — not protests themselves. OSF wrote in a December 2014 blog post , however, that it had made $2.5 million in investments to support “frontline community groups in Ferguson as well as develop a national database on the use of police force.” Then, two days later, OSF announced that it would award $2.9 million in grants in response to ongoing events in Ferguson and Staten Island, where protests followed the death of Eric Gardner: To supplement those efforts, we are this week making additional investments totaling $2.9 million in response to the recent events in Ferguson and Staten Island. One portion of the investment is intended to help community groups in Missouri advance initiatives to promote police accountability. A second component will further the development of a nationwide database involving police stops and use of force, thereby addressing one of the systemic flaws that limits the ability of police departments and communities to address bias-related issues. So, it’s true that Soros’s OSF group supported groups organizing protests in Ferguson. However, it appears that OSF mostly supported larger police accountability initiatives like nationwide databases — not the protests themselves. That’s why we called this one “true and misleading” at the time. Right now, there’s no proof to support claims that Soros is paying or organizing anti-Trump protestors. Check back for updates.

"Mike Pence Supports Electroshock Gay Conversion Therapy-Fiction!","2016-11-10 13:41:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mike-pence-supports-electroshock-gay-conversion-therapy/"," Mike Pence has supported electroshock gay conversion therapy that would “electrocute the gay” out of teenagers. "," Mike Pence has been a longtime vocal opponent of gay rights, but he vice president-elect never went on the record with support for electroshock gay conversion therapy. Those rumors appear to stem from a website that Pence launched in 2000 to support his first bid for a congressional seat. The site, which can now be found archived by the Wayback Machine , made what could be a reference to gay conversion therapy under the “Strengthening the American Family” section of “The Pence Agenda”: Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior. The phrase “gay conversion therapy” — let alone “electroshock gay conversion therapy” — does not to appear in the section. And the section refers generally to changing “sexual behavior,” not an individual’s sexuality — but people have reasonably concluded that Pence was referring to gay people because the three sections preceding the one in question addressed LGBT rights: Congress should pass the Child Custody Protection Act to require parental notification prior to the delivery of any contraceptive drugs or devices to minor children by any Title X funded clinics. Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage. Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual’s as a “discreet and insular minority” entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities. So, it’s true that Mike Pence has been a vocal opponent of gay rights. It’s also true that referred to “institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior” in a 2000 campaign statement.

"Following Trump Win, KKK Clansmen Openly March in North Carolina-Fiction!","2016-11-09 11:22:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/following-trump-win-kkk-clansmen-openly-march-north-carolina/"," A photo making the rounds of social media appears to show members of the KKK marching on a North Carolina bridge to celebrate Donald Trump carrying the state in the 2016 election. "," A viral photo making the rounds on social media shows Donald Trump supporters marking across a bridge in Durham, North Carolina — but they weren’t KKK members. That claim went viral on social media after Trump’s stunning upset win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Figures seen marching across an overpass bridge seem to have a passing resemblance to hooded KKK members in these hazy photos, but, according to reporters on the ground, they were not. The Burlington Times-News published clear photos of Trump supporters on the bridge waiving American flags and “Don’t Tread on Me” flags after “taking back” Alamance County. About a dozen Trump supporters were on the bridge, which they’ve done “15 to 30” times since February, the newspaper reports : Peering over the Tucker Street overpass Tuesday, Barry Brown and roughly a dozen other Donald Trump supporters waved flags at the passing motorists below. “I’m out here today because we as Americans have taken God out of America,” said Brown, of Liberty, who said he began his “Flagging 40” initiative on Alamance County Interstate 40/85 overpasses in February. “I believe that a Trump America would be great for America.” As he did Tuesday afternoon, each of those times since February, Brown has flown both a Christian and an American flag. On Tuesday, he was joined by other conservative demonstrators holding “Trump” and Gadsden “Don’t Tread On Me” flags, along with more Christian and American flags. Brown’s estimate of how many times he has waved flags over I-40/85 since February was “15 to 30.” A day after the original story appeared, Times-News reporter Natalie Allison Janicello took to Twitter to confirm that she hadn’t seen any KKK members on the bridge when she was reporting the story: Hey @michaelhayes , I'm a reporter here & it's not the KKK.

But no additional information about the investigation or the accusation that Clinton Foundation resources were used to pay for the wedding have come to light yet. The story went viral days before the 2016 presidential election when FOX News published a story on November 6th under the headline, “Clinton Aide Says Foundation Paid for Chelsea’s Wedding, WikiLeaks Emails Show”: Former President Bill Clinton’s top aide wrote in 2012 that Chelsea Clinton used Clinton Foundation resources “for her wedding and life for a decade” and a top Foundation donor was responsible for “killing” unfavorable press coverage – all as an internal Foundation audit uncovered numerous conflicts of interest and “quid pro quo benefits,” according to emails released Sunday by WikiLeaks. But the FOX News report failed to make clear that Clinton aide didn’t flat out state that the foundation paid for Chelsea’s wedding — he referred to an investigation into the matter. It’s not clear from the email exchange who would have conducted that investigation, or what it’s findings were. The email exchange was between Doug Band and John Podesta in January 2016 that was released by WikiLeaks . Band wrote that he had received a call from a close friend that Chelsea, identified in the emails as “cvc,” told “one of the bush 43 kids” that she is “conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation.” In a second email, Band wrote, “ The investigation into (Chelsea) getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents … I hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road…” So, it’s not clear exactly what “investigation” Band was referring to, or what, if anything, it concluded about foundation “resources” supporting Chelsea’s wedding or lifestyle.

The story begins: Cleveland, Ohio – Beyonce and Jay Z performed for “free” at the Get out the Vote concert last night for Hillary Clinton. However, sources revealed that the power couple was paid $62 Million to perform. According to sources closely connected with the power couple, Clinton and her campaign flew Beyonce and Jay Z out to a private meeting to discuss the election. With Hillary lacking the African-American voting numbers that Barack Obama had during his 2008 presidential, the Clinton campaign made a quick and desperate move in their final efforts to secure African-American votes. “Jay and Beyonce got a call a few weeks ago from Clinton.

The rumor started with the Denver Guardian , a relatively new fake news site that has been operating since July 2016. The story , which appeared under the headline, “FBI Agenet Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide,” begins: Walkerville, MD – An FBI agent believed to be responsible for the latest email leaks “pertinent to the investigation” into Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was Secretary of State, was found dead in an apparent murder-suicide early Saturday morning, according to police. Investigators believe FBI agent, Michael Brown, 45, shot and killed his 33-year-old wife, Susan Brown, late Friday night before setting the couple’s home on fire and then turning the gun on himself. Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI. Neighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames. “Mrs. Brown’s death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,” Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, “while Mr. Brown’s single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.” The story plays into the common “Clinton body count” conspiracy theories that Bill and Hillary Clinton have murdered friends, associates and enemies who threatened their political fortunes over the decades.

The story was widely shared on social media and was re-reported on various fringe websites as yet another Clinton email scandal took center stage in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.

"Obama Encourages Illegal Aliens to Vote-Misleading!","2016-11-07 13:09:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-encourages-illegal-aliens-vote/"," Citing “sanctity of the vote,” President Obama encouraged illegal aliens to vote in the 2016 presidential election without fear of being deported. "," President Obama didn’t intend to encourage illegal aliens to vote, but he appears to do so in a selectively edited video clip making the rounds. The clip was taken from an interview between President Obama and actress Gina Rodriguez on November 3rd. It gained widespread attention after Neil Cavuto aired this exchange between Obama and Rodriguez during a segment on his FOX News show: RODRIGUEZ: Many of the millennials, Dreamers, undocumented citizens — and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country — are fearful of voting. So if I vote, will immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us? OBAMA: This is not true. And the reason is — first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, et cetera. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for. After airing the clip, Cavuto said, “I can’t believe I just heard what I heard. The president isn’t even questioning whether the person who is an illegal is voting outside of reminding people that if you’re a citizen, you vote.” But the clip shown by Cavuto doesn’t tell the entire story. In the full interview , the president goes on to clarify that he wasn’t encouraging illegals to vote. Instead, he was talking about legal citizens voting who have undocumented family members: If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote. … Part of what is important for Latino citizens is to make your voice heard because you’re not just speaking for yourself, you’re speaking for family members, friends, classmates of yours in school who may not have a voice — who can’t legally vote. But they’re counting on you to make sure you have the courage you make your voice heard. So, while it’s true that Obama appeared to encourage illegal aliens to vote in the clip making the rounds online, the president clarifies in an unseen follow-up statement that he was talking about how important it is for legal U.S. citizens to vote because their undocumented friends and family members legally can’t.

The pre-determined outcome was Hillary Clinton winning with 42 percent of the vote, compared to Donald Trump’s 42 percent. "," There’s no truth to reports that news organizations mistakenly released pre-determined results of the “rigged” 2016 presidential election, with Trump losing. The rumor started with a post by self-described “deplorable freelance journalist” Jim Stone that appeared under the headline, “Busted: Here are the Complete Rigged Election Results. Trump Loses,” on November 1st. The report showed a graphic labeled “U.S. Presidential Popular Vote” showing Trump losing the election by a 2 percent margin. Stone reports: THIS WAS RIPPED STRAIGHT OFF THE WORLDNOW MEDIA SERVER FOX, CBS, AND OTHERS USE. THIS IS NOT A SPOOF, THEY HAVE ALREADY FINALIZED THE ELECTION AND PREPARED THE REPORT PAGES. THIS IS A BUST OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, WITH THREE DIFFERENT CONFIRMED NEWS STATIONS USED AS EXAMPLES. Worldnow is a central company that helps all the news stations stay synchronized so they all report the same news. This is a bust of that company, that already has the election results ready for the stations to post, complete with their station graphics. On election day, they go live with this. This is completely confirmed in the second report on this page, including proof that the posted results are NOT a test. The story was quickly picked up by fringe right-wing news sites and was cited on social media as proof of a “rigged” election. The original graphic appeared at WRCB TV, an NBC affiliate in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And it reportedly came from Associated Press election services.  In response to public outcry, WRCB TV clarified that “all news organizations test their election graphics” ahead of elections, and there was nothing fishy about it: Unpublished test election data appeared for a brief time on public servers this week for multiple news organizations that subscribe to the Associated Press election results service, including WRCB. Part of the test is to determine how the “winner check-mark” graphic and layout will appear on different platforms. The test data appeared for several state and national races, including president. Now that testing is complete, WRCB has removed the test data stream to return results to zero in preparation for election night. It is possible the test data stream may need to be turned on again for brief periods of time as designers continue testing the graphics. This has been the practice of news organizations for decades. We found links to similar election result graphics posted by local news affiliates around the country. WNEM , a CBS affiliate from Michigan, displayed a test graphic with slightly different results. Clinton edged Trump, 41.1 million votes to 40.7 million, in that one. It probably came from a different elections service provider. And for those who are still skeptical, election results in these graphics won’t be anywhere close to real the Election Day numbers. The WRCB TV test graphic, for example, shows a total of 99,958,413 votes cast. That’s nowhere close to vote totals in recent presidential elections. More than 129 million votes were cast in 2012 , more than 131 million votes were cast in 2008 . It wouldn’t make sense to rig an election with an unbelievably low voter turnout.

Bush and/or Vice President Dick Cheney deleted or lost 22 million emails that were sent using a private server during the Bush administration’s first term. "," The Bush administration reported that 22 million emails had been lost during a congressional inquiry in 2007, but the emails were later found to be mislabeled and many have since been released to watchdog groups. Accusations about President George W. Bush’s handling of emails, and his administration’s use of a private server, re-emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign as Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server took center stage. Clinton defenders have pointed to the Bush administration’s use of a private email server, and it’s inability to produce 22 million emails upon request, to argue that the media and congressional Republicans had a double standard in dealing with Clinton’s email issues. The Bush email fiasco was related to the firing of nine federal prosecutors in December 2006. Accusations that the firings were politically motivated led to a series of congressional hearings. In the course of those investigations, lawmakers requested email records and were told by Bush administration officials that millions of email records were not properly archived and had been “effectively deleted.” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and the National Security Archives filed lawsuits claiming that the Bush administration knew as early as 2005 that its lack of an email archiving system violated federal laws requiring that presidential records be persevered. The Clinton administration put in place an Automated Records Management System (ARMS) that “automatically captured, preserved and categorized all email sent through the White House email system” in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the Presidential Records Act. However, the lawsuit alleged , ARMS was deactivated under the Bush administration, which ultimately led to millions of emails being lost: In 2002, the EOP discontinued ARMS and did not replace it with any other system to automatically preserve White House e-mails or to categorize and separately archive FRA and PRA records. CREW’s Complaint sates, “As a result, since 2002, it has been possible for any e-mails housed on the White House servers to be manually deleted by anyone who has access to the servers.” CREW determined that “hundreds of days” of White House e-mails created between March 2003 and October 2005 were missing, amounting to at least five million e-mails that “had been deleted from the servers and were recoverable only on back-up tapes.” (The complaint) concluded that either server malfunction or manual deletion caused the loss of the e-mails. Although OA developed a plan to recover the missing e-mails and both OA and EOP developed a new records management system, “the White House has failed to implement any course of action to either recover the deleted e-mails from existing back-up tapes or implement an appropriate and effective electronic management system. But the Bush administration’s email woes went deeper than first believed. Later, it was revealed that as many as 22 million emails were missing from the official record. The emails were lost, in part, because administration officials used a private server supplied by the Republican National Committee (RNC) and no archiving system was in place, it was reported at the time . In December 2009, however, the Obama administration reported that it had recovered roughly 22 million Bush administration emails dating back to 2003-2005. The emails had been mislabeled, not deleted. A settlement negotiated between CREW and the National Security Archives and the Obama administration, which inherited the lawsuits, allowed for the release of some of the records: The Obama administration has agreed to restore 94 days worth of emails as part of the settlement. Attempting to recover all of the lost data would have been too expensive and placed an undue burden on the new administration. The days that will be selected for email recovery will be based on volume and on external events. CREW notes in its press release: “Documents produced so far show the Bush White House was lying when officials claimed no emails were ever missing. The record now proves incontrovertibly that Bush administration officials deliberately ignored the problem and, in fact, knowingly allowed it to worsen.” Meanwhile, the AP reports that Former Bush White House spokesman Scott Stanzel defends the Bush White House administration. He claims that CREW is creating controversy over nothing. AP quotes him as saying, “The liberal groups CREW and National Security Archive litigate for sport, distort the facts and have consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard IT issues.” In the end, it’s true that Bush administration officials were widely believed to have “lost” 22 million emails. But in 2009, the Obama administration found that the emails had actually been mislabeled and some were released. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction. ","Politics"

"," False reports that Queen Elizabeth had offered to “take back” America amid a tumultuous election cycle have been inspired by satirical writings. On October 29th, New Yorker magazine ran a column penned by satirist Andy Borowitz under the headline, “Queen Offers to Restore British Rule Over United States.” The column begins : LONDON (The Borowitz Report)—In an unexpected televised address on Saturday, Queen Elizabeth II offered to restore British rule over the United States of America. Addressing the American people from her office in Buckingham Palace, the Queen said that she was making the offer “in recognition of the desperate situation you now find yourselves in.” “This two-hundred-and-forty-year experiment in self-rule began with the best of intentions, but I think we can all agree that it didn’t end well,” she said. The Queen urged Americans to write in her name on Election Day, after which the transition to British rule could begin “with a minimum of bother.” And, as it turns out, that’s only to latest version of the joke about Queen Elizabeth restoring British rule. A letter in which the Queen supposedly outlined terms for restoring British dependency went viral on Facebook in 2011 . And, in early 2015, a woman wrote a letter to Buckingham Palace asking that the United States be remade into a colony of United Kingdom — and, to her surprise, Buckingham Palace actually responded : I have been asked to write in response to your recent letter to The Queen in which you express your views about the American government. Whilst your views have been noted, you will appreciate, I am sure, that there can be no question of the The Queen intervening in the affairs of another Sovereign state. So, the playful idea that the United Kingdom “taking back” the United States would be better than a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency isn’t a new one — but it also isn’t a true one.

Like, yesterday,” he said. “Mark my words and mark them well,” he addressed the crowd. “Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she’s a woman herself and not just any woman; she’s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she’s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.” Biden did speak in Pennsylvania around the time that this rumor went viral, which probably helped give it legs. However, a raw video of Biden’s appearance that can be viewed here shows that he made no mention of “lazy American women.” Biden, however, address the issue of women in the workforce. He said millions of American women were qualified to join the workforce but were unable to because of the high costs of childcare. Making childcare affordable, Biden said, would allow more women to join the work force and would ultimately help grow Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Ladies in the audience, you realize there’s millions of Americans women completely thoroughly qualified to be in the workforce but are not there now. Why? The cost of childcare. If you live in any city in America from a small town – a small city to New York City, you have two kids, a minimum $10,700 a year for adequate child care, $22,000 a year if you live in New York City. Ladies and gentleman, child care in Pennsylvania – average cost $14,700 for a family with two kids. That’s why women aren’t in the work force. Biden also raised the issue of fair pay for women in the speech: You young women in here, isn’t it hard for you to believe that we’re still debating whether if you do the same exact job as a man, you should get the same pay? I mean, think about that. Think about where we are – 2016. And the debate is still whether my daughter – graduated with honors and a Master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania should get paid the same amount that her counterpart is paid or any of you. It’s ridiculous. In conclusion, Biden didn’t blame women for the country’s sluggish economy. EFT News is filled with fake news stories with a right-wing slant. This report about Biden’s comments in Pennsylvania is just another example of that. ","Politics"
"Amish Community Throws Support Behind Donald Trump, Guaranteeing Victory-Fiction!","2016-10-27 13:51:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/amish-community-throws-support-behind-donald-trump-guaranteeing-victory/"," There are reports that the “American Amish Brotherhood” has thrown its support behind Donald Trump, ensuring that all Amish people will vote for the GOP candidate, and ensuring victory for him. "," A fake news website is behind false reports that the America’s Amish populations have overwhelmingly thrown their support behind Donald Trump, all but guaranteeing his election day victory. The report first appeared at fake news websites designed to look like ABC News and CNN’s websites in an effort to confuse readers. These sites even have similar urls as the real ones — the only difference is a subtle “.co” attached to the very end. The story , which appeared under the headline, “The Amish in America Commit Their Vote to Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him a Presidential Victory,” begins: COLUMBUS, OH (AP) — History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. Aside from the fact that the story originated from fake news websites, there are a few obvious red flags right off the bat. First, there aren’t 20 million Amish people in the United States. The actual population of Amish people in the United States and Canada was 251,000 in 2012. Second, we couldn’t find any record of a group called “American Amish Brotherhood,” so it’s unlikely that the group exists. But, like many fake news stories, this one is actually has a kernel of truth. Although Amish people aren’t encouraged by their elders to vote, they are discouraged or forbidden from doing so, either. And a pro-Trump group has been targeting Amish voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, the Economist reports : TRAFFIC jams are fairly common in Intercourse, a rural hamlet in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where corn fields and rolling hills flank the winding roads. The congestion is caused by horses and buggies driven by the Amish, especially when they make left-hand turns. Lancaster County is home to more than 30,000 Amish, who shun most technology and society. They live simply—around a third of the 300,000 Amish in North America survive on the land. The rest own or work in small businesses. So it is a little jarring to see a billboard on the side of the road just a few miles outside the village urging them to vote for Donald Trump. The billboard, which says that Mr Trump is “hard working, pro-life, family dedicated … just like YOU,” was paid for by AmishPAC, a political action committee targeting the self-segregated Amish community. Ben Walters, the PAC’s co-founder, says “every vote matters”, especially in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. Most Amish have never voted and have no interest in ever doing so. Their leaders tolerate the practice, but do not encourage it. Those who do vote, depending on how conservative their local church is, may be frowned upon. The Amish are not permitted to hold public office, and while they may take an interest in local elections they tend to avoid political engagement. They participate in other civic duties, like paying taxes, including income, property and sales tax. They do not receive or pay into social security as they believe it is their responsibility to look after the old. Their belief in self-sufficiency means they do not accept government subsidies. Targeting Amish communities is an unusual strategy when it comes to presidential politics, and only time will tell if it works. But the idea that there are 20 million Amish voters waiting to tip the scales in favor of Trump on election day is false. ","Politics"
"Bill Clinton Was Expelled from Oxford for Rape-Unproven","2016-10-27 09:11:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-expelled-oxford-rape/"," Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford in 1969 after he was accused of raping a woman named Eileen Wellstone. "," President Bill Clinton didn’t finish his degree program at Oxford, but there’s no proof that he was expelled or asked to leave the school because of rape allegations. And it’s true that a woman named Eileen Wellstone came forward in 1999 with allegations that Clinton sexually assaulted her after the two met in a pub, but there’s no way for us to say at this point whether those accusations are true or false. The earliest account we found was a Free Republic article from 2002 that recounted an investigation led by a man named Doug Thompson working for now-defunct publication called Capitol Hill Blue s: According to Thompson’s research, the reason that Clinton did not finish his studies at Oxford was that he was removed from the school and the country. The reason was his sexual assault on Eileen Wellstone whom he had met in a pub. Thompson claims to have verified the information from a State Department employee who had known the circumstances in the case. The report called for fellow classmates or instructors who knew Clinton at Oxford to come forward with information. We actually found accounts from classmates who knew Clinton at Oxford, and they don’t appear to jive with the picture of Clinton painted in the article (more on that later). More recently, accusations that Clinton was expelled from Oxford for rape resurfaced during the 2016 presidential election as Donald Trump faced rape allegations of his own from 11 women. Roger Stone, a longtime Clinton opposition researcher and Trump supporter, brought the Oxford allegations against Clinton back into the spotlight with social media posts like this one: As it turns out, Clinton’s time at Oxford was an issue in the 1992 presidential campaign, too. President George H.W. Bush argued on the campaign trail that Clinton’s time abroad had tainted his worldview and had left him disconnected with the American people. That led to the U.K.’s Independent to reach out to Clinton’s former classmates and instructors about how Clinton’s spent his time there “beside smoking dope.” The article reports hat Clinton was accepted to Oxford on a two-year Rhodes scholarship in 1968 after graduating from Georgetown. Clinton’s classmates described him as “a softie” and passionate objector to the Vietnam War, and the draft in particular: Clinton never completed his degree. In part this was due to his worry about the draft. According to one contemporary, he thought his first year would be his last and so there was little point in doing the work for a two-year degree; in his second year it was too late to start. This was not seen to matter. Many American Rhodes scholars treated their time at Oxford as a version of the Grand Tour. They had their degree and planned to go to law school when they returned to the US; Oxford was an interesting interlude. And Clinton’s fellow classmates don’t paint a picture of Clinton as a lady’s man or womanizer. At the time, Clinton was described as overweight and out-of-style with modern British trends: But jokes aside, Clinton was not, in the opinion of the women who knew him well at Oxford, a womaniser. Mandy Merck recalls: ‘Bill was plumpish, and ill-kempt, not a ladies’ man, although he was flirtatious in an amiable way. In any case, English women at Oxford were indifferent to Rhodes scholars. Mick Jagger-type men with tight hips and flared trousers were in, not wide-bottomed Americans.’ Looking back, Katherine Gieve says: ‘My abiding impression of Bill is that he was a softie; he wasn’t afraid of expressing his feelings.’ Sara Maitland remembers that he took her up to London to the Albert Hall to hear a Mahalia Jackson concert. At the end, Jackson sang, unaccompanied, a version of the Lord’s Prayer. ‘Bill was just in floods of tears. He said that the music reminded him of home, and it was strange to hear it in the Albert Hall, and it made him just homesick.’ Merck remembers: ‘Bill was the first boy I ever ‘came out’ to. In fact, he was just about the first person outside my circle I ever felt that I could tell I was a lesbian.’ While some of the other Rhodes scholars disapproved, Clinton simply treated it as an interesting fact. In the end, there’s no way to prove any of the facts surrounding the Eileen Wellstone’s rape accusations. We also can’t definitively prove that Clinton was expelled or “quietly asked to leave Oxford” for his conduct there. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Janna Little Ryan, Paul Ryan’s Wife, Is a Liberal Democrat-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-10-26 10:15:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/janna-little-ryan-paul-ryans-wife-is-a-liberal-democrat/"," It’s been reported that Janna Little Ryan, the wife of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), is a liberal Democrat who has soften Ryan’s conservative views and eroded his support for Donald Trump. "," It’s true that Janna Little Ryan comes from a prominent Democratic family, and that she championed liberal causes in college. But today Janna Little Ryan is described as a “practical conservative.” And data suggests that Paul Ryan has actually grown more conservative during his time in Congress — not less. Most of the background information about Janna Little Ryan in this rumor was taken from an article that appeared at Heavy under the headline, “Janna Ryan, Paul’s Wife: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know.” The report pulled together bits and pieces about Little Ryan’s family, political and professional background from other media reports. Most of these details came from a New York Times article on the Ryans that was published in 2012, shortly after Mitt Romney tapped Ryan as his running mate on the GOP ticket. The story, which appeared under the headlined, “For the Ryan’s, a Union Across Political Lines,” that begins: Their union was not necessarily one that friends and family saw coming. She was from a prominent Democratic family and dabbled in liberal causes during her college years at Wellesley, even once taking a road trip to Washington to march for women’s rights. And he, an up-and-coming Republican congressman, had worked after-school jobs to help support his family as a teenager and was known for his deeply conservative views. So, on the surface, it was surprising when Janna Little, a socially popular lobbyist on Capitol Hill, and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who had been dating aerobics instructors at his gym, hit it off after he asked for an introduction. They met at a party, started dating and were married in the winter of 2000. And reports describing Janna Little Ryan’s family as “Democratic royalty” from Oklahoma can usually be traced back to a 2012 ABC News report : Janna Ryan’s family has strong ties to Oklahoma politics. Her mother was appointed by the governor as a founding member of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission and the Oklahoma Council of Campaign Compliance and Ethical Standards, according to her obituary. Her grandfather, Reuel W. Little, helped found a third party – the American Party – in Oklahoma during the 1968 presidential race so to help former Alabama Gov. George Wallace get on the state’s presidential ballot, according to The Oklahoman. Reuel Little ran for governor in 1970 but received only 4 percent of the vote. Four years later after his failed bid, Little’s son-in-law David Boren waged a successful bid for the governor’s mansion. More recently, as Paul Ryan has become an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and all but pulled his endorsement of the GOP candidate, rumors have swirled that Janna Little Ryan is actually calling the shots behind closed doors and making her husband less conservative. These reports selectively cite facts about her background that fit that narrative — but other details, like this one from the New York Times profile, are intentionally left out: Friends say Mrs. Ryan chose her political life’s path with a sense of purpose, and they describe her as being a “practical conservative” these days , even if she might once have been more of a Democrat. And questions about Ryan’s brand of conservative have been raised ever since he was named House speaker in 2015. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that although Ryan was “the most conservative House speaker in generation” as measured using a congressional rating system, he was not “conservative enough” for some in the party: Ryan has taken a pragmatic tack in voting to keep the government going and avert shutdowns and crippling standoffs over the vast policy gulf between the parties. That approach puts him at odds with some more militant Republicans. Nevertheless, his voting history in the U.S. House places him to the right of current Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, according to the leading academic ratings of congressional voting pioneered by political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal. That history also puts Ryan to the right of the three previous GOP speakers of the postwar era: Dennis Hastert (speaker from 1999 to 2007), Newt Gingrich (1995-’99) and Joseph Martin (1953-’55). The notion that Ryan isn’t conservative is “absolutely insane,” says Keith Poole, the University of Georgia professor and a creator of the rankings. His data suggests that if anything, Ryan has grown a bit more conservative during his 17 years in the House. But because House Republicans have shifted so much to the right during his career, Ryan’s conservative ranking in his caucus is a little lower than it used to be. In Ryan’s first two years in office, he ranked as the 18th most conservative member of the House, according to the ratings. But he ranked as the 51st most conservative Republican in the last Congress (2013-’14). So, one prominent political scientist evaluating Ryan’s voting record concluded that Ryan has actually grown more conservative over his 17 years in Congress — the issue, it appears, is that the GOP has grown even more conservative than Ryan has. In the end, it’s true that Janna Little Ryan comes from a prominent Democratic family and championed liberal causes in college. More recently, however, she’s been described as a “practical conservative.” And claims that Ryan has grown less conservative over time appear to be false. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction. ","Politics"
"Dr. James Dobson: A Christian Pastor’s Analysis of the U.S. Election Drama – Incorrect Attribution!","2016-10-25 13:07:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dr-james-dobson-christian-pastors-analysis-u-s-election-drama/"," Dr. James Dobson, the founder and president of Family Talk, explained why he’s endorsed Donald Trump in a column that breaks down the U.S. election and the direction of the country from the perspective of a Christian minister. "," Dr. James Dobson has endorsed Donald Trump — but a column titled “A Christian Pastor’s Analysis of the U.S. Election Drama” didn’t come from him. The column appears to have been written by Pastor Steve Witt of the Bethel Cleveland congregation in Ohio. The earliest version of the column that we could find was posted at Witt’s Facebook page on May 11th. By mid-summer, the column was circulating without attribution, a “Christian pastor” was listed as its author. Then, by late summer, Dr. James Dobson’s name had been attached to the column and it was widely circulated via email, social media and discussion forums. There is only one difference between the original column written by Witt and the later one that was incorreclty attributed to Dobson. In the second to last paragraph, Witt wrote that “time will tell” if Trump is good for America. In later versions, “time will tell” was replaced with the line, “Nobody liked Gen. Patton, but he sure WAS an instrument of the United States for the right things.” Dobson, meanwhile, endorsed Trump in a column published by Christian Today on September 23rd under the headline, “ James Dobson: Why I Am Voting for Donald Trump.” In that column, Dobson focused on the importance of a conservative Republican candidate filling current and forthcoming U.S. Supreme Court vacancies: I don’t vote for candidates or political parties. I support those who will lead the country righteously, honorably, and wisely. In many ways, this is a single-issue election because it will affect every dimension of American life: the makeup of the Supreme Court. Antonin Scalia’s sudden death made this election the most significant of our lifetime. The next president will nominate perhaps three or more justices whose judicial philosophy will shape our country for generations to come. So, while it’s true that Dobson has endorsed Donald Trump, he didn’t do so in a widely circulated column that has been attributed to him. ","Politics"
"Texas Vote Switching Fuels Speculation About Rigged Election-Unproven!","2016-10-25 12:34:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/texas-vote-switching-fuels-speculation-rigged-election/"," Reports out of Texas that voting machines are automatically switching votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton have fueled speculation that the election is rigged. "," Local officials say that scattered reports of vote switching in Texas are a result of voter error, and we couldn’t find any evidence of widespread election fraud going on. Rumors that voting machines in Texas were automatically switching votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton started when early voting opened in Texas on October 24th. A handful of posts popped up on social media about vote switching or vote flipping in the Arlington and Dallas areas. Typically, these posts stated that the voter cast a straight Republican ballot only to find that the Clinton/Kaine box had also been highlighted: Officials at the Randall County Elections Office told local radio station KISS FM 969 that they were aware of the reports but had chalked them up to user error, “They said that there are several voters each year who report that their ballots are mis-marked, but they are usually caused by the voter accidentally selecting a different party.” And Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner issued a statement on October 25th saying that, “There is not wrong with any of the machines we use for voting. They do not flip your vote. They do not flip parties. Humans do that.” Tanner went on to describe “one incident in Randall County” where a voter voted straight ticket and when they hit the vote button, it flipped parties: They reported it to the election official and they cancelled that ballot and allowed the voter to vote again on another machine. The machine was then checked and nothing was wrong with the machine. I urge the voters to take the opportunity to review their ballots before they hit the vote button. As everyone knows, our fingers don’t always do what their brain tells them. Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos, a Republican, also pushed back against claims of widespread voter fraud in the state, the San Antonio Express-News reports : Reacting to GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s persistent claims that the election is “rigged,” Cascos, a Republican, said that’s “highly unlikely, very improbable” in this state because each of Texas’ 254 counties has its own voting system, many of them with analog equipment. “I am not concerned about a nationwide vote-rigging epidemic. I certainly don’t believe that it’s going to happen in Texas,” Cascos said. “There’s just too many protocols … at local offices where votes get counted. You’d have to be somebody ingenious, a massive conspiracy with a whole bunch of people involved to try to penetrate every single election office,” Cascos said. On the subject of voter fraud, which Trump also asserts is rampant, Cascos said it happens, but he’s uncertain how often and how significant it is. “I don’t think that anybody has a good handle on it,” he said. In conclusion, there were a few reports of vote flipping in Texas,  but local officials chalked them up to voter error, not rigged voting machines. Aside from a handful of social media posts, there doesn’t appear to be any proof that a vote flipping or vote switching is going on in Texas. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Vows to Get the NRA Shut Down for Good-Fiction!","2016-10-24 13:18:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-vows-get-nra-shut-good/"," Hillary Clinton is quoted as saying “I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns we will do it” in an interview with the Des Moines Register in August 2015. "," There’s no record of Hillary Clinton vowing to “get the NRA shut down for good,” and the Des Moines Register has debunked claims that it reported she made the statement. The rumor started with a meme that went viral on an anti-Clinton Tumblr page called “Shocking Hillary Clinton Quotes.” The meme links to an interview Clinton gave to the Des Moines Register in September 2015, but Clinton’s alleged promise to “shut down” the NRA for good doesn’t appear in the transcript. The Des Moines Register denied the rumor in a report that noted Clinton wasn’t in the state when the interview supposedly took place, and that there was no record of her making the comment: But here’s the thing: The quote is wholly fabricated. Clinton was never quoted in the Register making that statement, and it appears she has not made such a statement anywhere else. Clinton campaigned heavily in Iowa throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and Register reporters and the paper’s editorial board interviewed her several times. But she was not in Iowa on Aug. 8, when she allegedly made the statement. Clinton’s first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on Aug. 14, followed by public events on Aug. 15 and Aug. 26. And the paper quoted Clinton extensively on the issue of gun control and gun ownership in 2015, but we couldn’t find any record of her addressing the NRA or promising to ban handguns for good. In July 2015, Clinton addressed gun laws during the Democratic primary: I’m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that. A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists.” In August 2015, Clinton was quoted talking about guns in the Register after a television cameraman was shot and killed on air: In answering questions about the murder of a TV reporter and cameraman in Virginia, Clinton said she was deeply saddened, but added that their deaths need to spark action to restrict access to handguns. “We’ve got to do something,” she said. “It’s a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer … we will not see more needless, senseless deaths.” Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gives her remarks on the Virginia shooting and gun violence following her speech highlighting her rural policy plan at DMACC in Ankeny. “If guns weren’t so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could put some time out between the person who got fired, or domestic abuse, or whatever other motivation … maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage.” In October 2015, Clinton promised “tighter but sensible” gun laws . She talked about the gun lobby, and the influence of the NRA in particular: “I’m tired of people in public life saying, ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with families whose children are murdered at community colleges or elementary schools or people killed at Bible studies or going to the movies,’ ” the Democratic presidential candidate said. “We can’t tolerate that. This doesn’t just happen. … We let it happen.” “We keep getting stymied because of the lobby for a very small minority of gun owners and the gun manufacturers, which stand in the way,” she said. Clinton has spoken throughout the campaign about her intention to implement tighter gun rules, despite pressure from the National Rifle Association. This week, she released specifics of her proposals. “I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people’s Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be. There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders.” Finally, the Register quoted Clinton talking about gun violence after the San Bernardino terrorist attacks in December 2015: When Clinton met with reporters after her campaign appearance here Friday, The Des Moines Register asked if she believed the proposed ban on gun sales to people on the no-fly list could have prevented the San Bernardino shootings or any of the other massacres. “That’s like the question, ‘How do you prove a negative?’” she replied. “I don’t know exactly what it would have or could have prevented, but I do know that we’ve got to start implementing sensible gun-safety measures, and this seems like the most sensible that I know of. There have been numerous sales to people on the no-fly list for years now. And where those guns go, who ends up with them, we don’t have any idea.” Clinton said the proposed rule would be similar to bans on gun sales to felons, people with restraining orders or those with serious mental illnesses. “I think we’ve got to be more willing to start imposing these kinds of gun-safety measures. I’m certainly going to continue advocating for them.” So, we couldn’t find any record of Clinton talking promising “get the NRA shut down for good,” or to ban handguns. That’s why we’re calling this one “fiction.” ","Politics"
"Oregon State Leaves Donald Trump off Ballots-Fiction!","2016-10-24 12:49:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/oregon-state-leaves-donald-trump-off-ballots/"," Donald Trump’s name does not appear on ballot for the 2016 presidential election in Oregon, instead Hillary Clinton’s name appears twice. "," Donald Trump’s name has not been left off voter ballots in Oregon. That rumor started as a joke by Twitter user John Lussier who tweeted a picture of what appears to be a ballot that appeared to show Hillary Clinton’s name listed twice with the comment, “The Oregon state ballot doesn’t even bother with putting Trump on as a choice for president this year!!” Trump supporters and right-wing websites quickly shared the original tweet. The site Red State Watcher ran the story under the headline, “Breaking: Look What Oregon State Did to Their Ballot,” that fueled rumors that the election was rigged. But within an hour, Lussier deleted his original tweet and tweeted that it was nothing more than hoax: The Oregon Secretary of State’s Office said it had launched an investigation of the hoax and would establish whether Lussier had violated any of the state’s election laws. For his part, Lussier explained why he perpetrated the prank in an statement provided to NBC affiliate KGW: “A friend photoshopped that ballot image and posted in on Facebook. I shared it on Twitter and tagged some influential folks from the #TrumpTrain on Twitter — I wanted to see their reaction. I was not expecting so many retweets and shares. I’m now getting all kinds of replies: “Look, this all is rigged!” “Can this be real?” “My ballot has Trump on it!” After it took off I wanted to make sure folks knew it was fake, but by then it was too late. I’m not sure whether to delete the tweet, or continue replying to people letting them know, “Hey this was a hoax. You can’t trust everything you read or see and we’re each responsible for checking on the information we pass on.” It’s shocking to me how much traction this has. Folks are clearly worried about this election, and this kind of hoax resonates with their worries. At the end of the day I hope this causes people to look a little more carefully at what they’re spreading, and to get out and vote responsibly.

"," It’s true that Pope Benedict XVI wrote about Catholics supporting pro-choice causes in  2004, but the church’s position isn’t that Catholics can’t morally support pro-choice candidates like Hillary Clinton. rumor appears to have started with Tell Me Now , a website that publishes a combination of factual, fictional and opinion-based articles with an anti-liberal slant, with a story appearing under the headline , “Pope Benedict XVI Forbids Catholics from Voting for Hillary!” The story cites a 2004 letter written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , who became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, titled “Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion.” The letter addresses whether those who support issues like abortion and euthanasia can receive Holy Communion. The letter doesn’t name Hillary Clinton or any other candidate by name, and Tell Me Now selectively edited the letter to make it appear that Pope Benedict XVI was specifically talking about Cahtolics supporting political candidates: The Church teaches that abortion or euthanasia is a grave sin. The Encyclical Letter Evangelium vitae, with reference to judicial decisions or civil laws that authorize or promote abortion or euthanasia, states that there is a “grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection. […] In the case of an intrinsically unjust law, such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia, it is therefore never licit to obey it, or to ‘take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it’” (no. 73). Christians have a “grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which, even if permitted by civil legislation, are contrary to God’s law. Indeed, from the moral standpoint, it is never licit to cooperate formally in evil. […] This cooperation can never be justified either by invoking respect for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact that civil law permits it or requires it” (no. 74). Pope Benedict XVI advised priests in the letter to meet with parishioners who support or vote in favor of laws permitting abortion or euthanasia and to instruct them about the church’s stance on these issue. The letter says priests should warn parishioners that they may be denied the Eucharist for continuing their support: Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, when a person’s formal cooperation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his Pastor should meet with him, instructing him about the Church’s teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist. Cardinal Mario Popedda, the retired head of the Apostolic Signature (known as the Vatican’s supreme court), said in 2005 that it would be “formal cooperation in evil” to vote for a candidate solely because of  their support of abortion or euthanasia — but that’s rarely, if ever, the case because decisions are far more nuanced than that, Fr. Charles Irvin wrote : “I would be cautious in applying the word ‘sin,’ which implies intentionality. It would be more accurate to speak of risk or imprudence,” he said. “Of course, whoever votes for a ‘pro-abortion’ candidate assumes a responsibility, but it does not necessarily involve sin as an immediate consequence,” he said. The cardinal said a Catholic voter might choose such a pro-abortion candidate as a “lesser evil, when there are no candidates who respond more fully to his scale of values. He might choose him, let’s say, for other aspects of his (political) program that the voter supports.” Catholics who do vote for such a politician might carry out their own pro-life responsibilities in other ways, for example, by working against abortion through political or cultural initiatives, he said. “I think that rarely or never is there a candidate who presents himself solely on the basis of his support for abortion. And I think it’s very unlikely that a voter would vote for him solely for this reason,” he said. For his part, Pope Francis declined to endorse either Clinton or Trump in the election. Rather, he advised Catholic voters to “study the issues, pray and then vote your conscience,” the Associated Press reports : Francis was asked Sunday en route home from Azerbaijan how he would counsel the American faithful who are being asked to choose between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Francis said he would never interfere in an election campaign, saying “the people are sovereign.” “I’ll just say this: Study the proposals well, pray, and choose in conscience.” So, while the Catholic church’s views on support for pro-choice candidates appears to be open for discussion, claims that church leaders have said Catholics cannot morally support pro-life candidates solely for that reason are false.

"ISIS Calls for Support of Hillary Clinton-Fiction!","2016-10-21 12:07:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/isis-calls-support-hillary-clinton/"," An ISIS leader has called for Muslim voters in the U.S. to support Hillary Clinton. "," A fake news website is behind false reports that an ISIS leader has urged Muslims in the U.S. to vote for Hillary Clinton. The story , which was published by World News Daily Report , reported that a YouTube video that was taken down hours after it was uploaded showed ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani calling those who vote for Donald Trump “infidels.” The report continued: He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a “two face devil”, had the “charm of a pig” and was “treacherous as the snake”, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the “allied countries of the Islamic state” such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). “Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight” he added, visibly angry. The false report was shared nearly 300,000 times on social media. And, while World News Daily Report is a well-known fake news website, these types of reports have been known to cause widespread confusion when taken out of context on social media. ISIS leaders have not formerly backed either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, as far as we can tell. However, Foreign Affairs magazine review of ISIS social media channels in August found that the terrorist group’s support was leaning toward Trump: One might expect ISIS to view his candidacy with apprehension. However, interviews with ISIS supporters and recent defectors suggest just the opposite: jihadists are rooting for a Trump presidency because they believe that he will lead the United States on a path to self-destruction. Last week, an ISIS spokesman wrote on the ISIS-affiliated Telegram channel, Nashir, “I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump.” Meanwhile, an ISIS supporter posted on one of the numerous jihadist “channels” hosted by the Telegram messaging application, “The ‘facilitation’ of Trump’s arrival in the White House must be a priority for jihadists at any cost!!!” Analysis of ISIS chatter on social media and conversations with 12 current and former supporters of the group do indicate that ISIS strongly prefers Trump over the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. When asked to explain their preference for Trump, interviewees offered several reasons. First, Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric plays into ISIS’ narrative of a bipolar world in which the West is at war with Islam. Second, ISIS hopes that Trump will radicalize Muslims in the United States and Europe and inspire them to commit lone-wolf attacks in their home countries. Third, ISIS supporters believe that Trump would be an unstable and irrational leader whose impulsive decision-making would weaken the United States. And fourth, ISIS subscribes to the prophecy of a “Final Battle,” to take place Of course, the Foreign Affairs conclusion is based on anecdotal evidence collected from a dozen or so former and current ISIS members. Whether or not ISIS leaders have a preference as to who gets elected in the 2016 election isn’t clear. We can say with certainty, however, that the World News Daily Report claiming that ISIS has urged American Muslims to vote for Clinton is fiction. ","Politics"

"Hillary Clinton Leaked Classified Nuclear Window-Fiction!","2016-10-20 14:38:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-leaked-classified-nuclear-window/"," Hillary Clinton leaked classified information about the nation’s protocols for launching nuclear weapons during the final presidential debate by revealing that the nuclear launch window is four minutes. "," It’s not classified information that the nation’s nuclear launch window is roughly four minutes, so claims that Hillary Clinton “leaked” that information are false. Rumors that Clinton had erred in revealing classified information about how the U.S. would launch nuclear weapons began circulating during the debate. Clinton cited the short nuclear window while criticizing Donald Trump’s previous policy statements on nuclear proliferation: …The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that’s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button. Clinton critics immediately claimed on social media that she had committed “treason” or had blundered in revealing information about America’s nuclear launch protocols — but a simple Google search reveals that info about the four-minute nuclear window can easily be found online. A report by Bloomberg, for example, provides a minute-by-minute accounting of the steps that Clinton or Trump would have to take to launch a nuclear attack. The article concluded that the window for nuclear missiles launched from silos would take “about five minutes” and missiles launched form submarines would take about 15 minutes to strike their targets. And, while Clinton said that the nuclear window was “about four minutes,” we were able to find references to a four-minute nuclear window going all the way back to the cold war. It can easily be found on Wikipedia , too. Given all that, we’re calling claims that Clinton leaked classified information about the nuclear window “fiction.”","Politics"
"16 States Rig Election with George Soros Voting Equipment-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-10-19 13:04:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/16-states-caught-rigging-election-george-soros-voting-equipment/"," Sixteen states have rigged the upcoming election with voting equipment manufactured by Smartmatic, a company tied to billionaire Hillary Clinton supporter George Soros. "," Mark Malloch-Brown, the chairman of Smartmatic, is indeed tied to George Soros — but Smartmatic election equipment won’t be used in the 2016 presidential election. Rumors that Soros, a backer of Hillary Clinton and liberal causes around the world, had “rigged” the election in 16 states went viral as Donald Trump ramped up “rigged election” claims in mid-October. The rumor appears to have first appeared at Web Daily on October 16th. It quickly spread across right-wing websites, eventually landing at the Daily Caller . The claim has slowly morphed, but one popular version begins: Hillary is rigging the election! Surprised? You shouldn’t be. We’ve just learned that Hillary is tied to the one company that has the power to sway this entire election –Smartmatic. Smartmatic manufactures the voting machines that will be used this November. The Chairman of Smartmatic, Mark Malloch-Brown, is on the board of George Soros’ Open Society Foundation. Yes, George Soros, the billionaire CROOK who is one of Hillary’s biggest donors. The post goes on to claim that Smartmatic voting equipment will be used to rig elections in 16 states in Clinton’s favor: Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. The first part of the rumor, that Malloch-Brown is connected to Soros, is true. The second part, that 16 states are using Smartmatic voting equipment, is false. Malloch-Brown is listed as the chairman of Smartmatic, a London-based manufacturer of voting equipment, on the company’s website. Malloch-Brown’s bio states that he formerly served as vice president of Soros’ hedge funds and the billionaire’s Open Society Institute: Other positions have included vice-chairman of George Soros’s Investment Funds, as well as his Open Society Institute, a Vice-President at the World Bank and the lead international partner at Sawyer Miller, a political consulting firm. He also has served as Vice-Chairman of the World Economic Forum. He began his career as a journalist at The Economist. Smartmatic states on its website that it acquired Sequoia Voting Systems and “tripled” the company’s market share in the U.S. in less than a year. Sequoia manufactured the Dominion AVC Edge voting machine — which is listed as an approved voting device in scattered counties around the nation. However, those voting machines were purchased before Smartmatic acquired Sequoia Voting Systems. For its part, Smartmatic responded to controversy of the so-called rigged election by clarifying in a statement that none of its election technology will be deployed in the 2016 U.S. election and that it had no ties to Soros: Smartmatic is 100% privately owned. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and abides by a stringent code of ethics that forbids the company to ever donate to any political campaigns of any kind. The company’s headquarters were based in Florida for many years, but have since moved to London to service its global client base. George Soros does not have and has never had any ownership stake in Smartmatic. Rumors 16 states being caught “rigging” the election are based on the fact that Smartmatic acquired Sequoia Voting Systems, which had previously supplied voting machines to various counties in the U.S. Dominion or Sequoia voting machines could be used at polling locations in some of the 16 states listed in the rumor — but not in others. Arizona lists Sequoia voting equipment being used in one county. Illinois , Michigan and Missouri do not list voting equipment made by Sequoia or Dominion on their official sites. Other states list Dominion voting machines being used in some areas, but not exclusively. In conclusion, it’s true that Smartmatic’s chairman has connections to Soros. But no proof has been provided that Soros himself is involved with Smartmatic, or that the company’s voting machines are being used to rig the election in 16 states. This story was updated after Smartmatic released a statement. ","Politics"

Denzel Washington has endorsed Donald Trump and spoke out against President Obama, moves that supposedly shocked Hollywood. "," Denzel Washington hasn’t endorsed Donald Trump or spoken out against President Obama. These rumors date back to a 2012 interview that Washington gave to GQ magazine. During the interview, Washington was asked about his Christian upbringing and his take on Obama before he was re-elected. Washington, an early supporter of Obama in 2008, replied: Well, the story’s not told yet. He’s in the beginning of the third quarter. I don’t know what his legacy is yet. He’s the first — that’s a part of it. Like Jackie Robinson. But it just wasn’t the first game; it was lasting the whole thing. That somehow led to (false) reports that Washington had “defied Hollywood” by speaking out against Obama. Later, those reports morphed even further into claims that Washington had supported Trump’s presidency. The website American News 24 combined quotes from the 2012 GQ interview in which Washington talked about his Christian upbringing and this unrelated endorsement of Trump: “We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here,” he said. “He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.” That statement actually came from the brother of slain civil rights advocate who endorsed Trump in a March 2016 New York Post article : Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights icon Medgar Evers, came out Friday in support of Donald Trump for president. Himself a civil rights activist who in 1969 became the first black mayor in Mississippi, Evers said the GOP front-runner has the business acumen for the job. “I think he’s the best one right now,” Evers, 93, told The Post. “He’s someone like me: he speaks from the hip. He’s not a politician.” Evers said the Mississippi economy would benefit from a president who could bring back industries that have fled overseas. “We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here,” he said. “He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.” Washington, for his part, has described himself as moderate who has both liberal and conservative beliefs. In October 2015 he declined to endorse anybody in the 2016 contest when asked by The Hill on a press tour: While he supported Obama during the 2008 election, Washington said it’s too early to root for any of the 2016 presidential candidates. “We just need to know more,” he said, “It’s early days.” By August 2016, however, TMZ reported that Washington had teamed up with Magic Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson to throw a “massive fundraiser” that raised $1.3 million for Hillary Clinton. Still, we couldn’t find any other reports of Washington endorsing Clinton, and he doesnt’ appear in any of the pictures form the fundraiser. Given all that, we’re calling reports that Washington spoke out against Obama and switched to Trump “fiction.” ","Politics"

"," Allegations that President Obama was knowingly or intentionally showing off an erection to female reporters back in 2008 can’t be proven based on this video alone. A video published on a YouTube channel operated by The Incredible World on October 11, 2016, claims that CNN video shows Obama talking on the phone in the front of the plane while a woman holding a camera appears to giggle from the back of the plane. Then, while still speaking on the phone, Obama lifts his leg onto the armrest of a seat before he turns and continues the conversation. A caption published with the video explains what many people believe they saw: President Obama showing off his erection to giggling female reporters. 2008 video by CNN surfaces Obama showing off his erection. President Obama sexually harasses female staff. Obama exposes himself while having erection. Obama boner It’s not clear from that video, however, whether those claims are true or false. We were able to track down photos that a Getty photographer took while Obama was on that phone call, and the incident in question happened on May 7, 2008, after Obama boarded a campaign plane in Chicago. A higher-quality image of Obama while he spoke on the phone doesn’t appear to show him concealing anything in his pants — which is impossible to see from in low-quality of the video: It’s also impossible to tell from the video who recorded it, or who is giggling in the background. It’s been said the video was shot by CNN, but that doesn’t appear to be true. First, the low quality of the video indicates that it was shot on a smartphone, not by a professional television cameraman. Second, earlier versions of the video posted on YouTube don’t who the “CNN” logo in the corner of the video, which indicates that it was likely edited into the video later on. Third, if CNN didn’t show the video on-air (and we haven’t been able to find proof that it did), then there would be no reason for the CNN logo to be added to raw, unused video. And this video isn’t necessarily new, either. It was circulated among anti-Obama websites back in 2008 when it was first shot. Obami.com and other websites (most of which are no longer active) speculated about what the video showed and voiced outrage at it. The video (and allegations) began circulating again during the 2016 presidential election after a 2005 video was released that captured Trump making lewd comments about women, and then several women came forward with allegations of unwanted sexual advances or sexual abuse against Trump. Grabien News , for example, used the video to argue that the press had treated Trump unfairly: Donald Trump weathers a storm of controversy over randy comments he made to TV celebrity reporter Billy Bush in 2005, new video to emerge from the 2008 presidential campaign shows now-President Obama appearing to behave just as salaciously. Aboard a campaign flight, then-Senator Obama is talking on a cellphone as he arises from his seat; nearby a female reporter catches a glance of something that makes her uncomfortable, sending her skirmishing to the back of the plane. Obama, rather than downplay the awkward display, instead plays it up, positioning himself so the gathered reporters have little choice but to take in his chauvinistic performance. Given that it’s not clear who shot the video, who is giggling in the background or what the video shows, we’re calling claims that Obama flaunted an erection at female reporters “unproven.” ","Politics"

"," We’ve been able to confirm details about Hugh Galyean’s background as an FBI agent, but we haven’t been able to identify the original source of this open letter, so our investigation is pending. The open letter began circulating via emails and message board in late September, and it went viral in early October. It begins by stating that Comey “eloquently laid out” enough evidence against Hillary Clinton to convict her in federal court, but Comey “soft pedaled” Clinton’s actions as “extremely careless”: As a retired Special Agent of the FBI, I have standing to write this letter. My thirty years in law enforcement, including 22 years as a Special Agent with the FBI have given me the knowledge, expertise and experience to question and confront you for your perplexing actions, which (as you well know) were outside the normal standard operating procedure of the FBI and Federal judicial procedures. Some of the finest people in the world proudly carry the credentials of FBI Agent and you have soiled them and not allowed them to speak. But I will not be silent. We were able to use a credible newspaper report to confirm that there is, indeed, a retired FBI agent named Hugh Galyean. The Eastbay Times identified Galyean as the outgoing director of the Almeda County Sheriff’s Department Terrorism Early Warning Group in August 2016. A LinkedIn page for Galyean also confirms those details — however, we have been unable to identify the original source of the open letter, so we have been unable to confirm that Galyean wrote it. Our investigation is ongoing. The open letter goes on to allege that Clinton was not merely careless in her handling of classified information, but that she was “knowingly purposeful in her decision and actions to set up a server under her exlusive control and possession in order to control what information was available” to the public and Congress: Normally, an investigation will be assigned to an agent, or team of agents with one being the Case agent, or the lead investigator. When the investigation is complete, an investigative report will be presented to the U.S. Attorney for the Federal District involved. It would be the U.S. Attorney who decides whether to decline prosecution for that investigation….NOT the FBI agent. But in the Clinton investigation, YOU (unilaterally) decided not to forward the investigation to the U.S. Attorney or the Attorney General of the U.S. but, instead, personally made the decision not to prosecute her or even provide the information to a Federal Grand Jury. You were wrong to take this upon yourself. Sir, in order to indict a subject, only a preponderance of evidence , or 51% is needed for probable cause to exist. You did not think even that level of probability existed? Who do you think you are fooling? What judicial proceeding did you think you were following? The open letter concludes by asserting that Comey had “trampled on the rule of law” and had destroyed the public’s trust in the FBI and in unbiased enforcement of the law. ","Politics"

"," Juanita Broaddrick’s allegations that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 first reached a national audience during a 1999 appearance on “Dateline NBC.” Broaddrick, a volunteer for Clinton’s gubernatorial campaign, said during the interview that she didn’t tell anybody at the time because “I just don’t think anyone would have believed me.” The Washington Post summarized her accusations like this : In a gripping account punctuated by sobs, the Arkansas woman told “Dateline NBC” that in her Little Rock hotel room, Clinton suddenly “turned me around and started kissing me, and that was a real shock. I first pushed him away. I just told him ‘no.’ . . . He tries to kiss me again. He starts biting on my lip. . . . And then he forced me down on the bed. I just was very frightened. I tried to get away from him. I told him ‘no.’ . . . He wouldn’t listen to me.” However, questions have been raised about the accuracy of Broaddrick’s claims given that she signed an affidavit during the Paula Jones investigation in 1998 stating that the claims were untrue and that she had “repeatedly denied the allegations” made by newspaper and tabloid reports: 3. I met President Clinton more than twenty years ago through family friends. Our introduction was not arranged or facilitated, in any way, by the Arkansas State Police. I have never been an Arkansas state employee or a federal employee. I have never discussed with Mr. Clinton the possibility of state or federal employment nor has he offered me any such position. I have had no further relations with him for the past (15) years. 4. During the 1992 Presidential campaign there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies. Newspaper and tabloid reporters hounded me and my family, seeking corroboration of these tales. I repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my family’s privacy be respected. These allegations are untrue and I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me, or cause further disruption to my family. However, a Wall Street Journal report from 1999 details the sequence of events from 1992 to 1999 that supposedly led Broaddrick to deny the accusations before she suddenly came forward with them during special prosecutor Kenneth Starr’s investigation in 1999 : Trouble began in 1992, when the story Mrs. Broaddrick had shared with a small circle of friends reached a wide public, thanks to a business associate by the name of Philip Yoakum. A bitter opponent of Mr. Clinton, he urged that she come forward during the presidential campaign, which she declined to do. When the Paula Jones lawsuit came along, the plaintiff’s lawyers approached her, but Mrs. Broaddrick was determined to stay clear of involvement. That was how she came to sign the false affidavit. It was this matter that the White House spokesmen and others point to when dismissing her account. Her lawyer, Republican state Sen. Bill Walters, prepared the affidavit–the model for which he says he got from White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey, who was happy to oblige. Her lawyers, Mrs. Broaddrick relates, didn’t actually know the facts–that the sexual advances in question were very far from consensual. Her goal was to keep out of everything. When Kenneth Starr’s investigators came around, explains her 28-year-old son, Kevin, a lawyer, it was a different matter. “I told my mother–and she understood it–that this was another whole level. She knew it was one thing to lie in a civil trial so she could get away from all this, but another to lie to federal prosecutors and possibly a grand jury.” Fearful of punishment for that earlier perjury, she was prepared to admit to the independent counsel’s officers–after receiving immunity–that her prior affidavit had been false. In the event, it became a footnote in the Starr report, and carried no weight as far as obstruction of justice charges were concerned. Both Mrs. Broaddrick and her lawyers emphasize that no one from the White House had harassed her or subjected her to other pressures aimed at keeping the story quiet. The story was brought back onto the national stage during the 2016 presidential eleciton when Donald Trump appeared with Broaddrick and other women who had accused Clinton of sexual assault in a press conference held before his second debate with Hillary Clinton. Trump also retweeted an interview that Broaddrick gave to right-wing news site Breitbart on October 9th, the day after the debate. Clinton has denied the allegations through his attorneys all along. There’s no way that we can make a determination one way or another that Broaddrick’s allegations are true or false — which is why we’re calling them “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Donald Trump Accused of Raping 13 Year Old Girl-Unproven!","2016-10-10 10:21:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-accused-raping-13-year-old-girl/"," A civil lawsuit alleges that Donald Trump raped a 13-year-old girl in 1994. "," It’s true that a woman has filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Donald Trump raped her multiple times at “sex parties” held in 1994 — but the lawsuit remains unresolved. An unidentified woman alleges in the lawsuit that she was subjected to “acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assaults, battery, intentionally and reckless infliction of emotional distress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury” at several parties organized during the summer of 1994 by Donald Trump and fellow billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and Epstein paid an unnamed woman to lure girls to Epstein’s home in New York with promises of money or help launching modeling careers. The woman, identified in the suit as Tiffany Doe, said she witnessed Trump and Epstein rape the victim several times: Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties.On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiffto a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During thecourse of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop butwith no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump, Plaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The lawsuit was initially filed in California, but it was later withdrawn and an amended complaint was filed in New York. Evidence in the case isn’t clear, but a federal judge has ordered a status conference in December 2016 to review the “nature and action” of the suit and to determine whether the court has jurisdiction. The amended complain also includes a statement from a third witness, Joan Doe, who said the victim told her about the assaults back in 1994: “In the 1994-95 school year, I was told by the plaintiff in Jane Doe v. Trump and Epstein that the plaintiff was subject to sexual contact by the Defendants at parties in New York City during the summer of 1994,” her declaration states. So, it’s true that Trump has been accused of raping a 13-year-girl in 1994 — but those allegations have not been proven true. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Wanted to Drone Strike Julian Assange-Unproven!","2016-10-04 13:36:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-wanted-drone-strike-julian-assange/"," In a State Department meeting about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Hillary Clinton reportedly asked, “Can’t we just drone this guy.” "," Reports that Hillary Clinton asked, “Can’t we just drone this guy?”, during a State Department meeting about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can’t be verified because they use unnamed sources. These rumors started with a report that appeared at True Pundit under the headline, “Under Intense Pressure to Silence WikiLeaks, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange.” The report cited unnamed “State Department sources” who recounted a 2010 meeting about WikiLeak’s pending release of cables between U.S. and foreign leaders, which later became known as “CableGate”: Clinton’s State Department was getting pressure from President Obama and his White House inner circle, as well as heads of state internationally, to try and cutoff Assange’s delivery of the cables and if that effort failed, then to forge a strategy to minimize the administration’s public embarrassment over the contents of the cables. Hence, Clinton’s early morning November meeting of State’s top brass who floated various proposals to stop, slow or spin the Wikileaks contamination. That is when a frustrated Clinton, sources said, at some point blurted out a controversial query. “ Can’t we just drone this guy?” Clinton openly inquired, offering a simple remedy to silence Assange and smother Wikileaks via a planned military drone strike, according to State Department sources. The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, “walking around” freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States. Clinton was upset about Assange’s previous 2010 records releases, divulging secret U.S. documents about the war in Afghanistan in July and the war in Iraq just a month earlier in October, sources said. At that time in 2010, Assange was relatively free and not living cloistered in in the embassy of Ecuador in London. Prior to 2010, Assange focused Wikileaks’ efforts on countries outside the United States but now under Clinton and Obama, Assange was hammering America with an unparalleled third sweeping Wikileaks document dump in five months. Clinton was fuming, sources said, as each State Department cable dispatched during the Obama administration was signed by her. The first problem in proving whether or not Clinton seriously wanted to assassinate Assange is that the report cites unnamed sources that can’t be verified. The second problem is that there’s no way to tell if Clinton was making an off-color joke, which was possible given that the report said her remark stirred laughter. Clinton spokesperson Robbie Mook didn’t confirm or deny that Clinton made the remarks during an interview that aired on FOX 5 DC . When asked about whether or not Clinton actually made the remarks, Mook replied, “I’m reticent to comment on anything that the Wikileaks people have said. They’ve made a lot of accusations in the past.” The True Pundit report also raised questions about an email that Anne-Marie Slaughter sent to Human Abedin on November 23, 2010, with the subject line “an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks.” The body of the email doesn’t outline what “nonlegal strategies” were being considered, and a memo that was attached to the email has yet to be recovered, True Pundit reports. And it’s undoubtedly true that former Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel called for Assange to be assassinated during a live appearance on FOX Business —  but it’s not clear if Clinton shares his beliefs: The best way to deal with this is pretty simple. We have special ops forces. I mean, a dead guy can’t leak stuff. This guy is a traitor, he’s treasonous, and he has broken every law of the United States. The guy ought to be, and I’m not for the death penalty, so, if I’m not for the death penalty, one way to do it is to illegally shoot the son of a bitch. Still, given that True Pundit used unnamed sources, and the context for Clinton’s comments about Assange isn’t clear even if she did say them, we have no choice but to call this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Bill Clinton Has a Son Named Danney Williams-Reported as Fiction!","2016-10-04 12:49:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-son-named-danney-williams/"," Bill Clinton fathered a son named Danney Williams with a prostitute from Arkansas. "," Reports of Bill Clinton secretly fathering a son named Danny Williams with a prostitute date all the way back to the early 1990s, but they have long since been debunked. New twists on the rumor surfaced during the 2016 election, but they lack concrete proof that can be investigated. We’ll lay out a history of the Danney Williams claims to help put things into perspective. Rumors about Bill Clinton fathering a “love child” named Danney Williams started on the streets of Little Rock in the 1980s. A local activist and agitator named Robert “Say” McIntosh, who gained infamy for attacking local politicians in the press and with hand-made fliers, started the rumor with a flier that said Clinton wouldn’t run for president because of Williams. The Arkansas Times reports that McIntosh had a long history of attacking Clinton by that time: By the mid-1980s, the library’s alphabetized, indexed list of newspaper stories containing the name “Robert ‘Say’ McIntosh” often runs a full page of tiny type. He hounded Bill Clinton mercilessly about various policies and personal shortcomings (reportedly while on the payroll of assorted Clinton-haters), filling his flyers with scandalous allegations about Clinton… McIntosh’s story, which has been repeated countless times, goes that Clinton, while serving as the governor of Arkansas, was out for a jog in Little Rock in 1984 when he bumped into Bobbie Ann Williams, a 24-year-old prostitute who lived in a nearby housing project. A few days later, Clinton supposedly came back and offered Williams $200 to have sex with him behind some bushes. That supposedly led to an affair that carried on for months before Williams became pregnant with Clinton’s son. The rumor went national in February 1992 when tabloid Globe picked up the story and printed side-by-side pictures in which Danney Williams and Bill Clinton seemed to have similar facial features. The story floated in and out of the headlines for the remainder of the 1990s, mostly built on side-by-side photos of Clinton and Williams that showed similar facial features: In 1999, however, Time magazine reported that DNA testing had definitively proved that Danney Williams, who was 13 at the time, was not the son of Bill Clinton. We couldn’t find an archived version of the story, but the Independent reported a nice summary at the time: He may be the first president this century to be impeached, but there was some good news for Bill Clinton yesterday, with reports that he was not after all the father of an illegitimate boy in his home state of Arkansas. In an article headed “Scandal Interruptus”, Time magazine’s Internet website reported that DNA tests on the boy, Danny Williams, 13, and his mother, Bobbie Ann, had shown no match with Mr Clinton. “There was no match. Not even close,” Time quoted a source at the tabloid weekly, the Star , that commissioned the tests. The weekly was reported to have paid Ms Williams and her son to take the tests, intending to compare the results with the information about Mr Clinton’s DNA contained in the report of the independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr. The editor of the tabloid, Phil Bunton, had said that he would publish only if the test showed that Mr Clinton could be the father. But news of the investigation leaked out before the results were ready, reviving rumors that had circulated in Arkansas for years and clogging radio phone- in lines with callers wanting to have their say. Bobbie Ann Williams, who is black, was said to have told her mixed-race son ever since he was born that Bill Clinton was his father. She says that she was working as a prostitute when her son was conceived and that Mr Clinton was her only white customer that month. However, she never instituted a paternity suit. Numerous media outlets picked up the story in 1999, including Drudge Report , which, according to a report from the archives of the right-leaning Accuracy in Media non-profit, reported that Williams had been paid a six-figure sum to consent to the DNA testing: A claim by Bobbie Ann Williams, a Little Rock prostitute, that her son, Danny, was fathered by Bill Clinton has been proven false by DNA analysis. Star , the tabloid that first published Gennifer Flowers’ claim that she had been one of Clinton?s lovers, was reported to have paid Williams “a low six-figure” sum for exclusive rights to the story. It arranged to have Danny’s DNA checked against that of the President. On January 9, the Drudge Report broke the news that Time magazine had learned that the DNA tests cleared Clinton. Time ran a short story in its January 15 issue under the headline, “Scandal Interruptus; A bit less Jefferson in William Jefferson Clinton.” What Time was trying to do in this strange headline was to remind its readers of the claim that DNA tests had proven that Thomas Jefferson had fathered a son by his slave, Sally Hemings, as it reported that DNA tests had cleared Bill Clinton of fathering a son by a black hooker. Fast forward to 1999, and Drudge Report appears to be behind a re-surge of rumors that Bill Clinton fathered Danney Williams. The report links to a tweet from Danney Williams that references Clinton being his father, and a video in which Donald Trump’ ally, Roger Stone , claims that there was no paternity test without providing any evidence that that was true. And, in response to accusations from Stone and others that the mainstream media refused to report the story, Daily Beast reporter Olivia Nuzzi followed up on the story in May 2016. She set out to talk to the principle players in the story and to prove or disprove whatever she could. However, she found Danney Williams to be uncooperative. He refused to speak with her and referred her to attorneys who said that they had never represented him. In the end, Nuzzi concluded that “Danney Williams, as he says, is real. Everything past that remains in the rabbithole — the provenance of the supermarket tabloids and professional rumor peddlers.” ","Politics"
"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado Has a Sex Tape-Mostly Fiction!","2016-09-30 09:59:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/former-miss-universe-alicia-machado-sex-tape/"," Donald Trump tweeted that former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Hillary Clinton held up as an example of Trump’s sexism during the first presidential debate, has a sex tape. "," We couldn’t find any proof that Alicia Machado has a sex tape, but she was once filmed in an intimate encounter on a reality TV show. The former Miss Universe’s past was dredge up after Hillary Clinton said during the first presidential debate that Donald Trump had called Machado “Miss Piggy” when she gained weight after being crowned: CLINTON: And one of the worst things (Trump) said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman “Miss Piggy.” Then he called her “Miss Housekeeping,” because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this? CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado. TRUMP: Where did you find this? CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet… TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: … she’s going to vote this November. The day after the debate, Trump defended comments about Machado in which he called her “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” in an alleged reference to her Venezuelan nationality in an appearance on “Fox and Friends” : “She was impossible … She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. And (Clinton) found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” Then, in the early morning hours of September 30th, Trump went a step further by calling Machado “disgusting” and urging his followers to “check out sex tape”: Machado did pose for Mexican Playboy twice, and she was allegedly filmed having sex with a fellow contestant on “The VIP” Spanish reality show in 2008. It should be noted, however, that the clip was broadcast on TV and wasn’t released as a “sex tape.” Various porno producers have used Machado lookalikes in videos that are billed as “Alicia Machado sex tapes”— but we couldn’t find any indication that she actually appeared in one of them. Given that, we’re calling this one “mostly fiction.” ","Politics"
"Shooter Arcan Cetin Illegally Voted 3 Times-Mostly Fiction!","2016-09-30 08:39:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/shooter-arcan-cetin-voted-3-times-despite-lack-of-green-card/"," Arcan Cetin, the man accused of a mass shooting at Cascade Mall in Washington State on September 23rd, is a registered voter who participated in three elections even though he isn’t a naturalized citizen. "," It’s true that Arcan Cetin has voted in three state elections since 2014 — but he is a naturalized U.S. citizen who had the right to do so. Cetin, a Turkish native, was charged with five counts of murder in connection to a mass shooting at Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, on September 23rd. Almost immediately, speculation began to stir about Cetin’s political affiliations, citizenship and voting record. In the days that followed the shooting, state and federal authorities described Cetin as a “permanent U.S. resident” — not a naturalized U.S. citizen with voting rights. The National Review seized on those early reports to argue that non-citizens frequently vote for Democratic candidates: Arcan Cetin faces five counts of murder after his shooting rampage at a Seattle-area mall last week. But he also turns out to be a non-citizen who has voted three times in state elections since 2014. Liberals claim non-citizen voting fraud is extremely rare, but Cetin’s case should cast light on both just how easy it is to commit and the efforts of federal and state officials to block efforts to uncover it. Cetin, who is from Turkey, is a legal resident of the United States but not a citizen. In 2014, he registered to vote and voted three times, most recently in May’s presidential primary. Washington State, like all but a handful of states, doesn’t require any proof of citizenship. “Our hands are kind of tied,” Secretary of State Kim Wyman told a Seattle TV station, noting that the state doesn’t allow verification of a person’s citizenship for voting purposes. “But make no mistake,” she adds. “We want to make sure that everybody has confidence that people casting ballots are eligible. This is certainly going to be a topic at the next legislative session.” Local registrars can currently use a database to check the age and residence of people who register to vote, but a person’s claim to be a citizen is based on the honor system. However, NBC Washington affiliate KING 5-TV, the outlet that first reported that Cetin had voted illegally, updated its initial report with a correction that stated Cetin was indeed a naturalized citizen who legally voted: UPDATE: KING 5 learned Thursday that Arcan Cetin, the 20-year-old who killed five people at Cascade Mall on Sept. 23, is in fact a U.S. citizen. For days after the shooting, Cetin was described by local and federal law enforcement as being a permanent U.S. resident. He immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey when he was a child, after his mother married an American citizen. On Thursday, a federal official told KING that further investigation revealed that Cetin is a naturalized U.S. citizen. That means he was legally registered to vote. And, while it’s clear that Cetin praised an ISIS leader in a blog post , but his political affiliations aren’t clear at this point. Some have pointed to a 2015 tweet as proof that Cetin supports Hillary Clinton: However, Cetin appears to have been referring to the NFL Conference Championship game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks that was held on the same day, January 18, 2015, that Cetin tweeted. In saying that if “we win” he would vote for Hillary Clinton, Cetin appears to imply that he wouldn’t vote for Clinton under normal circumstances. So, it’s true the Cetin voted in three state elections in Washington since 2014, but he was a naturalized U.S. citizen who was legally allowed to do so. And claims that Cetin supports Hillary Clinton don’t check out since his tweet from January 2015 seems to state the opposite. ","Politics"

"," “Savage Nation” was pre-empted for live coverage of the first presidential debate on WABC, a New York affiliate of Westwood One radio network — but the decision doesn’t appear to be connected to his coverage of Hillary Clinton’s health. Rumors that Michael Savage’s show had been sabotaged or censored by a left-wing media conspiracy surfaced on the evening of the first presidential debate at Hofstra College on September 26th. Before the debate, Savage tweeted that he had been sabotaged on air to destroy support for Trump: Savage later explained on air that his radio show was censored from its largest market while he was in the middle of a comprehensive review of Clinton health conspiracies and discussions about treatment for Parkinson’s disease ( we previously investigated and found no evidence that Clinton has Parkinson’s disease ): I spent 30 minutes talking about Hillary’s health problems; I read you every fact about it. I then read you the pharmacology of Levodopa, which is the main drug for Parkinson’s, and right in the middle of that discussion of Levodopa and its side effects, I was cut off across the country. Pure sabotage. No advance notice from me or my producers. Then ‘ISDN problems’ during my discussion of the side effects of Levodopa, used for treating Parkinson’s. Then the two fill-ins trying to sound informed and clever from WABC who have 40% lower ratings than me, boasting on air during my hours that they conducted a ‘coup’ by taking Savage off the air. “Savage Nation” listeners immediately raised the issue with Westwood One, but representatives of the nationwide radio network said it wasn’t behind the decision and that WABC had decided to pre-empt “Savage Nation” with debate coverage, not Westwood One: Westwood One later told Radio Ink that, “Savage’s show was being pre-empted on WABC in New York so the station could provide their local audience live pre-debate coverage, which all affiliates obviously have the right to do. Westwood One did not pull Savage’s show off the network feed, it was WABC’s decision to go live.” And, while its very possible that Savage and his producers weren’t given advance notice of WABC’s decision to pre-empt his show, the affiliate did make a public announcement about its live coverage of the debate, which proves the decision wasn’t made on the fly to silence Savage’s discussion of Clinton’s health: It should also be noted that conspiracy theories about Savage being censored started almost immediately after WABC made the announcement on Facebook at 10:42 a.m. on the morning of the debate, with people commenting “Where’s Savage” and “Stop Censoring.” It appears the conspiracy theories about censorship had taken off well before Savage tweeted about it nearly six hours later. And the idea that Westwood One or WABC suddenly decided to silence Savage for talking about Clintons health on September 26th doesn’t make a lot sense since he’s been talking about it for weeks without being censored. A quick glance at the show’s archives shows that he spent extensive time on September 12 on August 22 without interruption. ","Politics"

"," Rumors about Donald Trump skipping the remaining presidential debates sprang from a satirical column that appeared in the New Yorker magazine after the first debate. The satirical column was written by Andy Borowitz and appeared at the New Yorker website a day after the first presidential debate. The column, which appeared under the headline, “Trump Threatens to Skip Remaining Debates if Hillary is There,” begins: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (The Borowitz Report)—Plunging the future of the 2016 Presidential debates into doubt, Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday morning that he would not participate in the remaining two debates if Hillary Clinton is there. Trump blasted the format of Monday night’s debate by claiming that the presence of Clinton was “specifically designed” to distract him from delivering his message to the American people. “Every time I said something, she would say something back,” he said. “It was rigged.” He also lambasted the “underhanded tactics” his opponent used during the debate. “She kept on bringing up things I said or did,” he added. “She is a very nasty person.” Taken out of context on social media, some believed that the column was actually true. Trump surrogates who took issue with how the first debate was handled and hinted at needed changes in future debates fed that speculation. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, for example, told Politico that he’d skip the remaining debates if he were Donald Trump: Donald Trump should skip the next two debates unless he gets special guarantees from the moderators, former New York mayor and top Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told reporters after the debate. Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor who moderated the debate, should be “ashamed of himself,” Giuliani said after the debate. He said Holt was wrong to attempt to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and his claimed opposition to the Iraq War. “If I were Donald Trump I wouldn’t participate in another debate unless I was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,” Giuliani said. “The moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.” There’s been no indication if Trump will demand changes to the formats of the remaining two debates, the Republican presidential nominee hasn’t given an indication one way or another. However, reports that Trump will refuse to attend debates if Clinton is there are false.","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Received Debate Questions in Advance-Fiction!","2016-09-27 11:24:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-received-debate-questions-advance/"," Hillary Clinton was given a list of questions that would be asked during presidential debates and other campaign events hosted by news networks. "," We initially rumors that Hillary Clinton had received debate questions in advances as “fiction” — but we’ve since learned that the rumor is a combination of truth and fiction. Rumors that Clinton had received the debate questions in advance started after the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump at Hofstra University in September. That rumor appears to be false. However, leaked emails have since confirmed that the Clinton’s campaign received questions in advance of two town hall events held during the Democratic primaries in March. CNN contributor and DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile supplied the questions to Clinton’s campaign, Politico reports : In the first instance, ahead of a March 13 CNN town hall, it appears that guest-moderator Roland Martin from TV One may have shared his contributions to the questions with Brazile. In an email the day before the town hall to senior Clinton staffers, Brazile wrote: “From time to time I get the questions in advance” and included the text of a question about the death penalty. An email later obtained by POLITICO showed that the text of the question Brazile sent to the Clinton campaign was identical to a proposed question Martin had offered CNN. (A similar, though not identical question, was ultimately posed to Clinton at the town hall). Brazile also tipped off the Clinton campaign that a “woman with a rash” would be asking a question during the town hall held in Flint, Michigan, with Bernie Sanders: In the newest email, sent one day before the March 6 Democratic primary debate in Flint, Michigan, Brazile tells senior campaign staff that “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.” CNN cut ties with Brazile on October 14th in response to the leaked emails, and the network stated that it was “completely uncomfortable” with what had occurred. So, while it’s true that Clinton received questions in advance of two town hall appearances with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders in March — there’s no proof that she received questions in advance for the three presidential debates with Donald Trump. The Baltimore Gazette fake news site published the report immediately following the first between Clinton and Donald Trump on September 27th. The story, which appeared under the headline, “Clinton Received Debate Questions Week Before Debate, According to Sources,” reports: Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton’s campaign headquarters, according to sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee. The reporter from Fox questioned campaign staff about the intern, but campaign staff at first claimed ignorance and then claimed that it was just a Fed Ex employee who had already left. No reporters present who had seen the intern dressed as a Fed Ex employee go into Mook’s office saw him leave by the same front entrance. The Fox reporter who recognized the intern also immediately looked outside of the campaign headquarters and noted that there were no Fed Ex vehicles parked outside. Clinton seemed to have scripted responses ready for every question she was asked at the first debate. She had facts and numbers memorized for specific questions that it is very doubtful she would have had without being furnished the questions beforehand. The entire mainstream media has specifically been trying to portray Trump as a racist and a poor candidate. By furnishing Clinton with the debate questions NBC certainly hoped to make Clinton appear much more knowledgeable and competent than Trump. And though it is unlikely that anyone will be able to conclusively prove that Clinton was given the debate questions, it seems both logical and likely. Baltimore Gazette states in its “About Us” section that it’s Baltimore’s “oldest news source and one of the longest running daily newspapers published in the United States” — but that description is intentionally misleading. In reality, the Baltimore Gazette had a 10-year from 1865-1875, records kept by the Library of Congress indicate. Someone recently revived the Gazette and has been publishing a mixture of real and fake local and national news stories that has left many readers confused. One example is a story about a man that stole Sudafed from a Walgreens on East Fayette Street in Baltimore — a story that sounds real enough, but isn’t. The story includes a description of the suspect and a phone number for readers to call with tips. However, Baltimore’s City Paper learned from police that that theft never occurred: BPD spokesman T.J. Smith says the story “doesn’t appear to be true” and notes that the phone number listed for anyone with information to contact is not affiliated with the department. It’s not clear who’s operating the site, but it’s safe to assume that it’s not a reliable source of news. That’s why we’re calling the rumor that Clinton received debate questions in advance “fiction.” ","Politics"

Reports that leaked emails from Hillary Clinton’s email server prove that she sold weapons to ISIS started with an interview that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange gave to Democracy Now in July 2016. When asked why he had created a searchable database of leaked emails from Clinton’s private server, Assange responded: So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails . There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone. Assange’s claim that Clinton had sold or pushed weapons to ISIS was repeated by right-wing websites like The Duran and Political Insider , but those stories link to Assange’s quote from above — not to emails that actually prove that Clinton supplied weapons to ISIS while she served as secretary of state. We sifted through the database of Clinton emails and couldn’t find any that indicated Clinton had pushed weapons to Syrian rebels. News reports indicate that the U.S. did begin providing arms to Syrian rebels in September 2013 — nearly a full year after Clinton had resigned from her post as secretary of state. The Washington Post reported on September 11, 2013, that the CIA had begun to ship light weapons and other munitions into Syria — and members of Congress actually criticized the administration for not doing so earlier: The delays prompted several senior U.S. lawmakers to chide the Obama administration for not moving more quickly to aid the Syrian opposition after promising lethal assistance in June. The criticism has grown louder amid the debate over whether Washington should use military force against the Syrian regime, with some lawmakers withholding support until the administration committed to providing the rebels with more assistance. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has pressed the Obama administration to do more to help the rebels, said he felt embarrassed when he met with Syrians along the Turkish border three weeks ago. “It was humiliating,” he said in an interview Wednesday night. “The president had announced that we would be providing lethal aid, and not a drop of it had begun. They were very short on ammunition, and the weapons had not begun to flow.” …The CIA shipments are to flow through a network of clandestine bases in Turkey and Jordan that were expanded over the past year as the agency sought to help Middle Eastern allies, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, direct weapons to moderate Syrian rebel forces. In June 2016, the New York Times reported that U.S. arms for Syrian rebels pushed through networks in Jordan and Saudi Arabia  had ended up on the black market (and could have ended up in the hands of ISIS) — but, again, those programs started after Clinton’s time as secretary of state: The training program, which in 2013 began directly arming the rebels under the code name Timber Sycamore, is run by the C.I.A. and several Arab intelligence services and aimed at building up forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The United States and Saudi Arabia are the biggest contributors, with the Saudis contributing both weapons and large sums of money, and with C.I.A. paramilitary operatives taking the lead in training the rebels to use Kalashnikovs, mortars, antitank guided missiles and other weapons. The existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its budget. American officials say that the C.I.A. has trained thousands of rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until Russian military forces — launched last year in support of Mr. Assad — compelled them to retreat. So, given that we couldn’t find emails indicating that Clinton had pushed weapons into Syria or to ISIS, and Corker’s account of his meeting with Syrians at the Turkish border contradicts those reports, and Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state doesn’t line up with weapons shipments to Syria, we’re calling this one fiction.

"President Obama Will Refuse to Leave Office if Trump is Elected-Fiction!","2016-09-26 09:13:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-will-refuse-leave-office-trump-elected/"," President Obama said he’ll refuse to leave office if Donald Trump is elected president. "," A fake news website is behind reports that President Obama will refuse to leave office is Donald Trump is elected. The rumor started with a report published by satire news website Burrard Street Journal in early September 2016 under the headline, “President Obama Confirms He Will Refuse to Leave Office if Trump Is Elected.” The story reports: Barack Obama has sensationally told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he will NOT vacate the Oval office if Donald J. Trump is elected the 45th President of the United States. The current president claims he is “fully prepared” to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called. “As president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation,” he explained. “If the American people elected ‘the Donald’ then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary.” When asked by the CNN anchor if he would remain in charge, Obama’s response was firm. “I am not standing down as president if it means four years of President Trump,” he said categorically. Within weeks, the story was had been shared nearly 100,000 times on Facebook. Another report by Burrard Street Journal that Obama announced that he would move his family to Canada if Trump were to be elected is also false. That one was nearly 40,000 times on social media within a month of belng published. Taken out of context, many readers believed that Obama had actually made the statement about not leaving office or moving to Canada if Trump were to be elected — but that’s not so.

"Hillary Clinton Cancels Event After Bizarre Eye Movements-Reported as Fiction!","2016-09-22 13:34:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-cancels-event-bizarre-eye-movements/"," Hillary Clinton was forced to cancel a campaign event after a video showed her making lizard-like “bizarre eye movements” that prove she’s suffering the lingering effects of head trauma. "," Like many other claims about Hillary Clinton’s health during the 2016 election, rumors that Clinton canceled a campaign event after exhibiting “bizarre eye movements” are unfounded. The rumor started with a video that was posted to a YouTube channel dedicated to Clinton conspiracy theories on September 22nd. The video shows a slow-motion close-up of Clinton’s eyes while she spoke at an event in Philadelphia on September 19th, and a caption states: Hillary Clinton began to exhibit bizarre eye movement and strabismus (crossed eyes) during her speech in Philadelphia yesterday before unexpectedly canceling today’s scheduled events. It’s true that Clinton postponed a fundraising lunch planned in North Carolina a day after her speech in Philadelphia — but no reason was given by Clinton’s campaign, CBS affiliate WNCN reports : Meanwhile, Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed. The Clinton event was billed as “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” and had four donation levels to attend. Those contribution levels were described as $100,000, which featured “chair reception with Hillary,” $33,000, which included a “host reception with Hillary,” $5,000, which included “preferred seating” and $2,700. No reason was given for postponement of the Clinton event, which was planned to take place at the home of Betty Craven and Michael Warner. The notion that Clinton suffers from strabismus dates back to a head injury she suffered in a December 2012 fall. Bill Clinton was quoted as saying the injury “required six months of very serious work to get over” back in 2014. Clinton’s political opponents, including Karl Rove, argued that there were long-term effects of the head injury that could affect her judgment and ability to serve as president ( Rove later backed off from those claims, but they still persist today ). The American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Stabismus reports that stroke is the leading cause of strabismus in adults, but it can also be the result of brain damage that impairs eye control or damage to nerves that control the eyes. However, Clinton doesn’t appear to exhibit strabismus in the viral YouTube video. The video does not appear to show horizontal strabismus (cross eyes) or vertical strabismus (a lazy eye) — which are the two main types. Rather, the video is extremely zoomed in and plays in slow motion so it looks strange when Clinton looks from side to side while she talks. A full video of the speech can be viewed here, and Clinton’s eyes don’t look unusual when it’s played in real time. It’s not clear why Clinton canceled her North Carolina fundraiser, but video of her at the rally in Philadelphia doesn’t appear to match strabismus. That’s why we’re reporting this one as fiction.

"Clinton Campaign Started Birther Claims in 2008-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-19 13:05:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-campaign-started-obama-birther-claims-2008/"," Hillary Clinton started the birther movement that questioned President Obama’s nationality during the 2008 presidential campaign. "," Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign didn’t start the birther movement that followed President Obama throughout his two terms in office. Clinton supporters did, however, bring the birther movement onto the national stage during the 2008 Democratic primaries by circulating emails and photos designed to raise questions about Obama’s religious beliefs and nationality. The origin of the birther movement was called into question shortly after Donald Trump publicly dropped his years long birth crusade against Obama in September 2016. In an official campaign statement, Trump accused Hillary Clinton of starting the rumor in 2008 — which sent the internet into overdrive. The Washington Post was one of the first publications to explore the origins of birtherism and claims about Obama being a “secret Muslim” in June 2008 . The paper reported that rumors about Obama’s religion and nationality had been in wide circulation via forwarded emails since as early as January 2007. The paper found, however, that those claims could be traced back to a man named Andy Martin. Martin is an internet publisher who made the claim in August 2004 to “put some sizzle on the plate” because he was considering challenging Obama for a Senate seat: Martin, a former political opponent of Obama’s, is the publisher of an Internet newspaper who sends e-mails to his mailing list almost daily. He said in an interview that he first began questioning Obama’s religious background after hearing his famous keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In an Aug. 10, 2004, article, which he posted on Web sites and e-mailed to bloggers, he said that Obama had concealed his Muslim heritage. “I feel sad having to expose Barack Obama,” Martin wrote in an accompanying press release, “but the man is a complete fraud. The truth is going to surprise, and disappoint, and outrage many people who were drawn to him. He has lied to the American people, and he has sought to misrepresent his own heritage.” Martin’s article did not suggest an association between Obama and radical Islam. Martin was trying to launch a Senate bid against Obama when he says he first ran the Democrat’s name by a contact in London. “They said he must be a Muslim. That was interesting to me because it was an angle that nobody had covered. We started looking. As a candidate you learn how to harness the Internet. You end up really learning how to work the street. I sort of picked this story up as a sideline.” Martin said the primary basis for his belief was simple — Obama’s father was a Muslim. In a defamation lawsuit he filed against the New York Times and others several months ago, Martin says that Obama “eventually became a Christian” but that “as a matter of Islamic law began life as a Muslim” due to his father’s religion. From 2004 to 2007, birtherism gained momentum in a “whisper campaign.” Questions were posed and emails were circulated about Obama’s nationality and religious beliefs as he rose to prominence, even though the mainstream media didn’t cover the story. That changed during the 2008 Democratic primaries that pitted Clinton against Obama. The Clinton campaign didn’t outright question Obama’s nationality or background, but staffers did strategically release photos and other tidbits that fed voter questions or suspicions about Obama’s background. In December 2007, it was reported that two Clinton staffers were asked to resign due for circulating rumors about Obama being a Muslim. The fact that the staffers were asked to resign implies that Clinton herself did not approve of the tactic. In February 2008, it was widely reported that Maggie Williams, a Clinton staffer, released a photo of Obama wearing traditional Somali garb in an apparent effort to fuel speculation or fears about his background: In a statement , Williams didn’t deny releasing the photo and criticized Obama’s campaign for embracing the issue: Enough. If Barack Obama’s campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive, they should be ashamed. Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely. This is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry. We will not be distracted. So, rumors that Clinton personally started the birther movement are false. Its roots date back to August 2004, well before Clinton and Obama crossed paths. But Clinton staffers fueled speculation about Obama’s background that played into birtherism — it’s not clear whether or not Clinton was personally involved in those decisions. That’s why we’re calling this one “truth” and “fiction.” ","Politics"
"Chelsea Clinton’s Apartment a Secret Hospital –Unproven!","2016-09-16 11:01:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/chelsea-clintons-apartment-secret-hospital/"," Chelsea Clinton’s apartment is a secret medical facility that Hillary Clinton visits to get treatment for conditions that she keeps hidden from the public. "," There’s no way to prove or disprove that Chelsea Clinton has a secret medical facility in her New York City apartment that her mother uses to treatment secret medical conditions. Those rumors began circulating after Hillary Clinton abruptly left a 9/11 event and nearly collapsed as aids loaded her into a van. People immediately questioned why Hillary, who had been diagnosed with pneumonia, wasn’t taken to Chelsea’s apartment rather than a hospital for treatment of what her campaign described as “overheating.” One of the first people to float the idea that Chelsea had some kind of a secret medical facility in her apartment was Martin Shkreli, a controversial pharmaceutical investor who rushed to Chelsea’s apartment to “find Hillary” after she was taken there. Shkreli made the comment during a live Periscope feed outside the apartment: I was hoping to see some medical equipment being carted in. My guess is that there’s space-aged technology in that apartment, and that it is not Chelsea Clinton’s apartment but it’s a triage center for Hillary Clinton while she’s in New York. Have we ever been inside? Have we actually seen an apartment where people live? I believe there is actual medical equipment in that apartment. Shkreli seemed to invite speculation about a secret medical center at Chelsea’s apartment, and that’s exactly what followed. Soon, reports went viral that Chelsea’s apartment, located in The Whitman at 21 East 26th Street in New York, had the same address as a business called Metrocare Home Services, sparking speculation that the apartment was actually a secret medical facility. A forwarded email sums up the secret medical center theory like this: For a woman very secretive about her ambiguous medical conditions…whom avoids hospitals like the plague, it occurred to me that when the Clinton’s bought this incredibly expensive apt. for their daughter in 2013…they may have also purchased it with the intent of using it as a secret private medical treatment facility for Hillary to use during her anticipated campaign. To the press…it would only appear Hillary was just dropping in for a visit with her daughter…when, in reality, she is receiving medical treatment and controlled substances from private physicians and private pharmacists…on private property (no need for disclosure). Claims that Chelsea’s apartment had the same address as Metrocare Home Services are outdated. The were based on this outdated profile page listed at Healthcare.com. We called the phone number listed and found that Metrocare Home Services was acquired by or merged with Metrocare Givers, Inc., which has an address in Brooklyn. It’s not clear when, exactly, Metrocare Home Services left Chelsea Clinton’s apartment building. But the home care provider was likely forced to move when the building, which had been owned by a plumber’s union, was acquired by developers in 2011. The developers immediately set out to build multi-million dollar luxury condos, the Observer reports : The Whitman, as the handsome brick and limestone manse is to be known, will have three full-floor residences, priced at $10 million, $10.25 million and $10.5 million (the cost increases incrementally as the floors go up), and a 6,540-square-foot duplex penthouse. The penthouse comes with three terraces (totaling 3,000 square feet),  a $22.5 million price tag and the ultimate luxury—27,500-square-feet of air rights.  Enough to build another mansion on top, or to sell to Madison Square Park’s next luxury-minded condo developer. The New York Post reported in March 2013 that Chelsea and her husband, Marc Mezinsky, had purchased The Whitman’s third floor apartment for about $10 million. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon reportedly purchased the second floor condo, and Jennifer Lopez reportedly purchased the two-story penthouse: Last week, ex-President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton toured the apartment, graciously posing for photographs with the hard hats who were working at the building. Chelsea, 33, and Marc, 35, “live in the neighborhood and found the building on their own while out walking,” a source said. “It’s great for them, because it is in a hot neighborhood and it is very private. There aren’t hundreds of neighbors, and there is great security.” The unit at 21 E. 26th St. is four bedrooms, with 6 1/2 bathrooms, and the family room has a full view of the park. The master bathroom is made of Italian marble. The spread also boasts a home office and media room. So, while there’s no way to prove or disprove that Chelsea’s apartment is a secret medical center for Hillary to use while on the campaign trail — there doesn’t seem to be anything outright suspicious about the apartment. The fact that a home health provider previously had its offices there is likely a coincidence. And it should be noted that Metrocare provides basic in-home care and rehabilitation services to seniors. It doesn’t seem likely that a home healthcare provider’s headquarters would have had advanced or “space aged” medical equipment that the Clintons could have used. A page listed at AgingCare.com for Metrocare Givers describes basic home health services offered by the company: Metrocare Givers, Inc. is a home care provider that services New York, NY 10010. Home care services allow seniors to remain safely in their own home while receiving medical care or assistance with personal care and other daily tasks. Services vary, but some providers offer companionship services or skilled home health care services for individuals who require ongoing health monitoring, assistance with administering medications or wound care. But, then again, there’s no way to prove that medical equipment wasn’t later added to Chelsea’s apartment. For all those reasons, we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Democrats Holding Emergency Meetings to Replace Hillary Clinton-Unproven!","2016-09-13 13:15:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/democrats-holding-emergency-meetings-replace-hillary-clinton/"," Democratic Party leaders have secretly met to discuss replacing Hillary Clinton as the party’s presidential nominee. "," There has been talk about Democratic leaders talking about a plan to replace Hillary Clinton if she were to withdraw from the party’s ticket for health reasons — but Clinton would have to voluntarily remove herself from the ticket for that to happen. And despite rumors and calls for Democratic leaders to put together a contingency plan should Clinton’s health render her unable to continue — there’s been no indication that those meetings have actually taken place, or that Clinton has considered removing herself from the party’s ticket. The flap started after bystander video showed a dazed Clinton being propped up by campaign staffers before she was put inside a van and whisked away from a 9/11 event in New York City. The video fueled (unfounded) rumors that Clinton was secretly suffering from serious health complications, and possibly even Parkinson’s disease. During the fallout, former MSBNC and Al Jazeera America host David Shuster tweeted that he had learned from Democratic operatives that the DNC would stage an emergency meeting in the coming days to pick a replacement for Clinton because she could not campaign with pneumonia. Shuster then deleted his original tweet and tweeted a correction that said the DNC would “consider” choosing a replacement for Clinton: Shuster’s tweets fueled lots of speculation, and it appeared to be warranted when Don Fowler, the DNC chairman from 1995 to 1997, called for party leaders to meet to discuss a contingency plan for the “extremely unlikely” event that Clinton would withdraw from the ticket for health reasons in an interview with Politico : A former Democratic National Committee chairman says President Barack Obama and the party’s congressional leaders should immediately come up with a process to identify a potential successor candidate for Hillary Clinton for the off-chance a health emergency forces her out of the race. “Now is the time for all good political leaders to come to the aid of their party,” said Don Fowler, who helmed the DNC from 1995 to 1997, during Bill Clinton’s presidency, and has backed Hillary Clinton since her 2008 presidential bid. “I think the plan should be developed by 6 o’clock this afternoon.” It should be noted, however, that Fowler said he expected Clinton to fully recover from pneumonia. Still, he said the party would be “mistaken” to not have a contingency plan based on existing bylaws that empower the DNC to name a replacement candidate that fits specific guidelines or parameters. Vox explains that the Democratic and Republican parties have similar bylaws for choosing a replacement candidate, and the first rule for both is that Clinton or Donald Trump would have to choose to willingly relinquish the nomination: Nobody can force them to do so — only the nominees can make the decision to give up their position as their party’s presidential candidate, according to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (Of course, a candidate could also die, forcing the parties onto the same track as if he or she had dropped out.) But if a candidate did decide to voluntarily step aside, he or she wouldn’t be allowed to pick a replacement. Instead, either party would use a system a little like the Democratic Party’s superdelegates, but on steroids. The members of the parties’ national committees would get together to vote for whomever they want. The candidate with the majority of votes from the national party committees — which consist of 350 people for the DNC and 150 people for the RNC — would then become the presidential nominee. The national committees could pick pretty much anyone — for instance, Tim Kaine or Joe Biden on the Democratic side, or Mitt Romney or Ben Carson for the Republicans. And they could do so at any point up to and including Election Day, even after absentee and early voting has started. At this point, talk about party leaders meeting to discuss an emergency plan for a Clinton replacement should she be unwilling or unable to continue is nothing but talk at this point. There’s been no indication that Clinton plans to drop out of the race. Given all that, we’re calling this one unproven. ","Politics"

The rumors come from an article posted at the fringe website Victurus Libertas under the headline, “Temper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over an Hour – Throwing Glass at Staffers Head.” The article cites a number of credible reports in which liberals had “meltdowns” over Matt Lauer’s line of questioning with Clinton, and Lauer’s failure to correct the record in his interview with Donald Trump — but the article doesn’t cite any credible sources to prove that Clinton herself melted down or threw a glass at a staffer’s head. In one instance, the article linked to a Politico report that supposedly referenced a Clinton meltdown in which she demanded that Lauer be fired and could be heard threatening NBC executives — but this excerpt doesn’t actually appear in the Politico story : Hillary’s meltdown included throwing a water glass at a staffer- narrowly missing her head, and demanding Matt Lauer be fired!  She was overheard threatening executives at NBC saying “If I lose, we all go down and that Fascist Fuck will have us swinging from nooses! What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?” The article then cited unnamed sources that supposedly said Clinton “screamed that she wanted Matt taken off the October debate” and went on an expletive-ridden tirade about campaign staffer Donna Brazile.

"Hillary Clinton Has a Body Double-Unproven!","2016-09-13 09:58:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-body-double/"," Hillary Clinton’s campaign used a body double after Clinton suffered a medical episode at a 9/11 ceremony in New York. "," Rumors that Hillary Clinton has a body double are nothing but speculation at this point. The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson’s disease. Clinton’s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday’s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely. After her stumble outside the 9/11 event, Clinton was reportedly taken to Chelsea Clinton’s NYC apartment to rest. Questions about a Clinton body double emerged after she appeared publicly, saying she was “feeling great” and, “It’s a beautiful day in New York.” Side-by-side pictures that were taken of Clinton before and after she emerged from the apartment argued that her nose looked suspiciously different: Other side-by-side pictures were used to argue that her cheek, teeth, smile and ears were different before and after she emerged from Chelsea’s apartment: Another side-by-side picture was used to argue that Clinton’s index finger was longer than her ring finger in an earlier picture — but that wasn’t the case when Clinton emerged from Chelsea’s apartment: In the end, it’s impossible to use these side-by-side pictures to definitively prove that a Clinton body double was used. Different lighting, different angles and different cameras create pictures that look very different, and that’s why we’re calling this one unproven. ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton “Probably” has Parkinson’s Disease-Unproven!","2016-09-09 14:00:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-probably-parkinsons-disease/"," Dr. Ted Noel has said that after evaluating Hillary Clinton from afar, he’s concluded that she has Parkinson’s disease. "," Claims that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson’s disease are unproven. Questions about Clinton’s health, her coughing fits and her so-called on-camera seizures (we investigated that one and found it be false) have persisted for months. The most recent (unproven) health claim about Clinton came from Dr. Ted Noel, a board-certified anesthesiologist, who said in a video posted on the Next News Network YouTube channel that he had concluded that Clinton ”probably” has Parkinson’s disease after watching video clips of her exhibiting symptoms like falling, imbalance, coughing, seizure and more: PD is a chronic disease with a downhill prognosis. HRC’s instability and frequent cough suggest that her PD is advanced. This is not a good outlook for someone running for the Presidency. The office of the President is one of the highest stress jobs in the world. Stress sets off PD episodes, which render the sufferer incapable of proper response. At this point, a bit of speculation seems appropriate. HRC talks about her yoga sessions. But no one we know of has ever documented one. It is possible that this is cover for sessions designed to teach her coping mechanisms for PD or for rest breaks. Exhaustion makes PD worse. HRC’s coughing suggests that her swallowing disorder is advanced, placing her closer to an aspiration pneumonia that would disable or kill her. That’s bad enough, but PD has one more, even more dangerous step in its progression. As PD continues, cognitive problems can develop. In time, they become full-blown dementia. The United States cannot survive if its President is mentally impaired. One of the main problems about Noel’s diagnosis is that he doesn’t appear to have any medical training in degenerative neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease at all. Online medical records state that he’s worked as an anesthesiologist in Orlando for 36 years — which doesn’t appear to give him any kind of expertise in diagnosing neurological conditions. And a quick glance at the progression of Parkinson’s disease seems to conflict with Noel’s diagnosis that Clinton has “advanced” PD. The fourth and fifth stages of PD, which are considered advanced, bring about limited movements that require a walker or wheelchair, advanced stiffness in the legs that makes it impossible to stand or walk, and hallucinations and delusions, Health Line reports . Clinton’s actions on the campaign trail don’t support that idea that she has advanced PD. Her movements would be far more limited, and there’s a good chance she would be unable to walk or stand on her own. In conclusion, there’s no evidence to support claims that Clinton has Parkinson’s disease — but it’s impossible to definitively prove she doesn’t have it from afar. That’s why we’re calling this one unproven. ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Wore Earpiece at Presidential Forum-Unproven!","2016-09-09 13:25:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-wore-earpiece-presidential-forum/"," Hillary Clinton wore a “micro earbud” during the presidential forum on national security. "," There’s no firm evidence that Hillary Clinton wore an ear piece during the presidential forum — and her campaign has denied the accusation. The rumor started at True Pundit in a story posted on September 7th under the headline, “NYPD: Hillary Clinton Was Wearing ‘Invisible’ Earpiece to Receive Stealth Coaching During Live NBC TV Town Hall.” The reported said there was “a quite buzz” had begun circulating in New York law enforcement circles about an alleged micro earbud that Clinton had in her left ear during the forum: The skin-tone piece Clinton was wearing, however, was somewhat different from the standard issued stealth earpiece and is much different in appearance from a hearing aid. This unit is considered a “micro” earbud which contains all the technology but is a fraction of the size with a very high price tag. In fact, most of the units this size, approximately 3mm or comparable to a small pearl stud earring, are normally issued to law enforcement or corporate security teams, sources said. At a size that small, the earbud is designed to sit inside the opening of the ear canal, almost invisible to anyone. However, the unit does move and shift along with its wearer and at times can slightly pop out of the canal and require a quick readjustment, experts said. The story didn’t name any specific sources within the New York law enforcement community, so we can’t fact-check the report or verify its sources. The primary evidence for the earbud argument appears to be a video segment that shows light reflecting from the inside of Clinton’s left ear. However, it wasn’t clear whether that was skin, an earpiece placed there by NBC producers, or a “micro earbud” that allowed her to hear direction from somebody off the stage. The Clinton campaign told Fox News that Clinton was not wearing an earipiece and that the shiny reflection was simply light reflecting on the skin inside Clinton’s ear. Nick Merril, a Clinton campaign spokesman, also poked fun of Alex Jones and Donald Trump Jr. for spreading the rumor that Clinton was wearing an earpiece on Twitter: Some have noted that earbud flap is very similar to controversy that played out in the 2004 campaign. George W. Bush was accused of wearing a listening device during the debate that was visible as a square bulge in the back of his suit jacket. A NASA photo analyst even weighed in on the controversy , and some believe to this day that Bush was wearing a listening device even though a spotty photo was the only proof of that Much like the Bush controversy of 2004, there’s no proof that Clinton was wearing an earpiece during at the 2016 forum beside a zoomed in photo. If history repeats, however, that likely won’t stop rumors or speculation about it among Clinton’s critics for years to come. Given a lack of evidence, we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Politics"
"PBS, Facebook Censored Jill Stein’s Criticism of Hillary Clinton-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-07 09:17:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pbs-facebook-censored-jill-steins-criticism-of-hillary-clinton/"," PBS cut Jill Stein’s criticism of Hillary Clinton from a segment that appeared on Newshour in August. Then, after a video drawing attention to PBS censoring Stein’s criticism of Clinton went viral on Facebook, the social media joined PBS in censoring Stein and removed the video. "," It’s true that Jill Stein’s criticism of Hillary Clinton was cut from the Green Party’s August 23rd appearance on PBS Newshour. And it’s also true that a video pointing out that Stein’s criticism of Clinton was removed from Facebook — but it appears to have been removed because of a copyright violation, not censorship. First, we’ll start from the beginning. Stein appeared in an eight-minute segment on the show in which she talked about a range of issues with host Judy Woodruff. The editing in question came from Stein’s response to Woodruff’s question, “So, are you saying literally that Hillary Clinton is every bit as bad for the country as Donald Trump, that there’s no difference?” Stein offered a lengthy response in which she talked about Clinton’s support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and shortcomings of Obamacare. However, those statements were cut from a segment that aired on PBS. In the segment, which can be viewed here , Stein appeared to respond: I wouldn’t say there are no differences, but the differences are not enough to save your job … We feel that, in this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we’re going to have, but whether we’re going to have a world or not going forward. And knowing that the majority of Americans is unhappy with those two party choices, this is the time for us to open up … So we’re pushing for opening up the debates. And then let’s see how the chips fall. Critics quickly noted that an unedited version of the segment that appeared on Facebook, however, revealed that Stein was more critical of Clinton and Obamacare than PBS viewers would have been led to believe. A Facebook user and Stein supporter named Matt Orfalea posted a video that highlighted parts of Stein’s response that were edited out of the broadcast: I wouldn’t say there are no differences, but the differences are not enough to save your job, because Hillary Clinton and now her transition director Ken Salazar, they’re big proponents of Trans-Pacific Partnership which is basically NAFTA on steroids, and most observers believe that it will send our jobs overseas as well as undermine American sovereignty by bringing in these international tribunals that get to pass judgment on our laws, on our public health protections, on our worker protections. So we can’t count on saving our jobs — saving our lives. One in three Americans now can’t afford healthcare under Obamacare. Or saving the planet because Hillary has been a big proponent of fracking as is Ken Salazar, her transition director. We feel that, in this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we’re going to have, but whether we’re going to have a world or not going forward. And knowing that the majority of Americans is unhappy with those two party choices, this is the time for us to open up. Americans have not only a right to vote, but a right to know who we can vote for. So we’re pushing for opening up the debates. And then let’s see how the chips fall. Nick Massella, Newshour’s director of audience engagement and communications, acknowledged that the interview had been edited in a statement , but he maintained that it was nothing more than standard industry practice to cut interviews for time: “Sometimes when an interview is prerecorded, the producers must make some edits before air time as the rest of the pieces of our program come into place and timing is finalized. That is what happened here with our interview with Jill Stein and is commonplace in broadcasting. With the advent of Facebook Live, we can also offer viewers immediate access to the full interview, and in this case, the opportunity to pose questions to the guest. Judy Woodruff told the television audience that the full interview, including audience generated questions, was available online on Facebook at the end of the segment.” Conservative media outlets have seized on Newshour’s editing of Stein’s interview as proof that PBS supports Democrats, and Clinton in particular. The producers of the show have denied that and noted that the full version was available online. Then, Orfalea posted a blog at Medium under the headline, “Now I have been censored by Facebook” that said Facebook had removed the video without notice. Orfalea added, however, that people sharing screenshots of their posts of his original video received this explanation from Facebook: “Your post was removed. It looks like the link you shared doesn’t follow our Community Standards. If you think your post shouldn’t have been removed, let us know by filing out this form.” The idea that the video was removed because it violated “Community Standards” and might have offended some people sparked outrage. Some argued that far more offensive videos are allowed, some showing violence or cruelty toward animals. However, Facebook Community Standards don’t just deal with offensive content. They also deal with intellectual property and copyright infringement, as the site explains : Facebook is a place for you to share the things that are important to you. You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. However, before sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so. We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights. Learn more about intellectual property rights. So, the Stein video could have easily been removed because of a copyright violation — not censorship. Facebook generally removes videos that are r eported to them as copyright infringements . Because Orfalea edited Newshour’s original content in his video, a copyright infringement claim could have resulted in it being taken down. Given all that, we’re calling the claim that PBS censored Stein “true,” but claims that Facebook joined in the censorship “fiction.” ","Politics"
"Cornell Law Library: Hillary Clinton’s Private Email Server Disqualifies Her for Presidency-Fiction!","2016-09-02 12:12:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cornell-law-library-hillary-clintons-private-email-server-disqualifies-her-for-presidency/"," A “word for word” read of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071, from the Cornell Law Library clearly disqualifies Hillary Clinton to serve as president because of her use of a private email server. "," Claims that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state have been around for some time, but they don’t seem to check out. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasy sparked controversy when he publicly argued on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Clinton was disqualified to serve as president under U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071 — the same one cited in the Cornell Law Library claim: “I think the more dangerous part of this, from her standpoint, is not so much the placement of the material here as wiping the server. Number one, that’s a felony, but that statute disqualifies you from holding any further office in the United States and she’s running for a further office under the United States.” The statute that Mukasey referred to, as it appears in the Cornell Law Library, reads: (a)Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b)Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. However, Seth Barrett Tillman, a former Rutgers law professor, countered that applying the statute to presidential candidates would be unconstitutional because “the only limits on qualifications to be president are the Constitution — having U.S. citizenship, being at least 35, and having lived in U.S. at least 14 years,” Pete Williams of NBC News reported in August 2015. Seth Barrett Tillman later clarified his position in an email to TruthorFiction.com: My position is that no federal statute, e.g. Section 2071, can add qualifications to elected federal positions, including the presidency. Those qualifications include: being a natural born U.S. citizen, being 35 years old or older, and 14 years residence in the United States, and also others listed in the Constitution…. Mukasey later reversed his previous position that the public server email flap disqualified Clinton from running for president in another appearance on MSNBC News. Given all that, we’re calling claims that a word-for-word reading of U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2071, at the Cornell Law Library disqualifies Clinton from serving as president as “false.” ","Politics"
"JFK Jr.’s Untimely Death Cleared Hillary Clinton’s Path to Senate-Reported as Fiction!","2016-08-30 11:08:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jfk-jr-s-untimely-death-cleared-hillary-clintons-path-to-senate/"," The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999 has become the latest in the ongoing “Clinton body count” thread of suspicious deaths supposedly tied to the Clintons. "," Conspiracy theories that JFK Jr. was murdered by the Clintons to clear a path for Hillary’s Senate run have been around for years, but there’s nothing but speculation to back them up. Michael Savage, the outspoken conservative host of “Savage Nation,” insinuated that the Clintons were tied to JFK Jr.’s death as far back as 2008. In an exchange with a caller about the New York Senate seat Clinton once held, Savage said : SAVAGE: Yeah, see, that seat was classically the liberal senator from New York, and it was Patrick Moynihan, who was, by the way, a very balanced liberal. He was not one of these extreme left-wing whack jobs. He was extremely reasonable, Moynihan. The young Kennedy was supposed to run; if you remember, he died in a tragic plane crash. Do you remember that one? CALLER: JFK Jr., absolutely. SAVAGE: Thank you. And to this day, people wonder why he died in a plane crash, and then suddenly, enter from the — from stage left, the carpetbagger Hillary Clinton, who moved to Chappaquiddick (sic: Chappaqua), and next you know, she’s running for the presidency. That’s a whole story that only a novelist could write. I can’t write it. But now, you see, she’s suddenly secretary of state and now they want to fill it with a shoo-in. Why shouldn’t it go to a Puerto Rican or a black person rather than Caroline Kennedy? Huh? Savage insinuates that JFK Jr. “was supposed to run” for the Senate, and that it’s suspicious Clinton was elected to the seat a year later. But that doesn’t prove that the Clintons killed him. Then, in October 2015, Stone teased a new book that he was working on about JFK Jr.’s “murder” in a response to a tweet echoing Savage’s insinuation that the timing of Kennedy’s death and Hillary’s Senate run was suspicious: INSERT TWEEET Stone, a conspiracy theorist who wrote books called “The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ” and “The Clintons’ War on Women” provided more details about his forthcoming book in an interview in April 2016, stating: “I have a book coming up in which I make the case that John F. Kennedy Jr. was murdered — and he was murdered by the Clintons, because he was in the way. Now, I have extraordinary new evidence that nobody else has seen.” It’s not clear what “new evidence” Stone plans to unveil to prove that the Clintons murdered JFK Jr., so we can’t speak to its credibility or verify it in any way. But a closer look at the facts surrounding JFK Jr.’s political aspirations and tragic death seems to poke holes in Clinton murder conspiracy theories. Shortly after his death, Kennedy Jr.’s friends told the New York Daily News that he had “mulled” a run for Senate in 2000, but he decided against it when Hillary came forward: A private poll in 1997 found that John F. Kennedy Jr. was by far the state’s most popular Democrat, and two friends said yesterday they believed he would have run for office some day. Earlier this year, in one of the best-kept secrets in state politics, Kennedy considered seeking the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) in 2000, friends confirmed yesterday. The idea became moot once First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled her interest in running, but the two friends said they expected the son of the slain President eventually would have jumped into politics as a candidate. “He was dedicated to public service, and he was going to run for public office in the foreseeable future,” said one friend who recently broached the subject with Kennedy. The friend spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I would have been surprised had he not run for office in the next five years. The obvious question is why the Clintons would have killed a well-respected Democrat who didn’t appear to have any intention of challenging Hillary in a Senate race. Aside from that, the National Traffic Safety Board released a report on JFK Jr.’s death in 2000 that concluded it was the result of “pilot error” and “spatial disorientation” resulting from coming in for a landing over water at night: “The pilot’s failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were haze and the dark night.” Given that no evidence has been provided linking the Clintons to JFK Jr’s death, that the younger Kennedy had no apparent intention of challenging the Clintons politically, and that the NTSB didn’t raise any suspicions about the wreck that claimed his life, we’re reporting this rumor as “fiction.” ","Politics"

"," We couldn’t find any credible evidence to support these claims about Megyn Kelly, so we’re reporting this one as fiction. Fringe right-wing websites drummed up rumors that Kelly was being forced out of Fox News because viewers of “The Kelly File” have been tuning out in droves because of Kelly’s apparent support of Hillary Clinton. On August 27th, the Conservative Tribune published one such report under the headline, “BREAKING: Fox News Exposes Traitor Megyn Kelly, Kicks Her Out for Backing Hillary.” The story begins: The Kelly File host Megyn Kelly has gotten into a lot of hot water for her many attempts to smear Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. F ox News fans are not happy, and have been turning off her show in droves. Disturbingly, it’s even fallen behind The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC in ratings, which is embarrassing. All of this is a clear sign that Megyn is on the way out. Bill O’Reilly is a big Trump supporter, because he recognizes Trump’s leadership ability and close connection with the American public, and because he knows what a disaster a Hillary Clinton Presidency would be. Megyn, unthinkably, seems to be a closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win. The article’s claims that Kelly’s ratings are slumping and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has surpassed her — are totally false. In reality, Kelly continues to lead in cable news ratings, according to data published by Adweek on the same day that the Conservative 101 story broke: This story and others similar to it deploy a familiar tactic. The headline makes a bold, declarative statement: Megyn Kelly has been exposed as a liberal and kicked out at Fox News for backing Clinton. However, the body of the story doesn’t cite evidence to back that claim and waffles with soft wording like “seems to be a closet liberal” and “all of this is a clear sign that Megyn is on the way out” that doesn’t match the headline. Rumors that Megyn Kelly has been exposed as a traitor who supports Clinton and is being forced out of Fox News are totally false. ","Politics"

"EpiPen Maker Donated to Clinton Foundation, Hiked Prices-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-08-25 14:40:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/epipen-maker-donated-clinton-foundation-hiked-prices/"," After Hillary Clinton condemned Mylan, the maker of EpiPens, for increasing prices of the life-saving devices by 400 percent since 2008, allegations that the price hikes were tied to Mylan’s Clinton Foundation donations went viral. "," The Clinton Foundation once partnered Mylan, but the partnership didn’t have anything to do with EpiPens. First, we’ll provide a little context. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch came under fire in August 2016 over her company increasing the price of EpiPens by 400 percent since 2008. Hillary Clinton quickly condemned Mylan’s price hikes, calling them “outrageous” in an official campaign release “That’s outrageous – and it’s just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases.  But it’s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. “That’s why I’ve put forward a plan to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these.  As part of my plan, I’ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value.  Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. FOX Business News accused Clinton of crying crocodile tears about the price hikes in a segment , noting that Mylan had partnered with the Clinton Foundation shortly before the price hikes began. Other outlets picked up the story and showed a picture of Bill Clinton accepting a check from former Mylan CEO Robert Coury in about 2009. Claims that the Clinton Foundation had directly benefits from the EpiPen price hikes, or had in some way shielded Mylan from scrutiny over it, immediately followed. But there’s no proof that either of those things are true. While it is true that the Clinton Foundation announced a partnership with Mylan in 2009 to make second-line antiretroviral (ARV) HIV/AIDS drugs more affordable, that partnership had nothing to do with EpiPens. And the notion that Mylan would have needed protection from the Clinton Foundation to raise the price of EpiPens by 400 percent is wrong. As the New York Times reports , these types of price hikes are legal and common among drug companies: Mylan, while not commenting on why it has repeatedly increased the price, says that most EpiPen users are insured and that the company offers a coupon that can reduce or cover the patient’s co-payments. Such co-payment assistance is part of the standard playbook for companies selling expensive drugs: The goal is to spare the consumer, who might create a political uproar, and yet still get paid by the insurance company or government health program. So, while it’s true that the Clinton Foundation once partnered with Mylan on HIV/AIDs drugs, there’s no proof that the partnership impacted EpiPen prices in any way. Bresch has been called to testify before a congressional panel. ","Politics"
"Huma Abedin Worked at Radical Muslim Journal-Mostly Truth!","2016-08-25 10:40:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/huma-abedin-worked-at-radical-muslim-journal/"," Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide Huma Abedin previously worked at a radical Muslim journal. "," Reports that Huma Abedin spent more than a decade as the editor of a Muslim journal that can be described as radical are true. Abedin worked as editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs . Abedin was born in Michigan but her family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was two years old. There, her father, Syed, founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs and served as the first editor of its Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. Following Syed’s death in 1993, Abedin’s mother, Saleha Mahmood, proceeded him as editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. Abedin took over in 1996, a February 2016 Vanity Fair profile reports : It turns out the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs is an Abedin family business. Huma was an assistant editor there between 1996 and 2008. Her brother, Hassan, 45, is a book-review editor at the Journal and was a fellow at the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies, where Nasseef is chairman of the board of trustees. Huma’s sister, Heba, 26, is an assistant editor at the Journal. A Newsweek profile of Abedin includes even more detail about her association with the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, and her family’s ties to Saudi Arabia. Abedin’s parents spent their careers at Saudi Arabian universities. Abedin’s mother, Saleha, is a sociologist and vice dean at a women’s college in Jeddah. Her late father, Syed, helped start an international journal devoted to the Muslim diaspora in non-Muslim lands, called the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. Abedin worked part time at the Journal between 1998 and 2009, until she went to the State Department. Right-wingers see evidence of a possible sleeper in that association, as well as in the fact that she served on the board of a Muslim Student Association at George Washington University that, a few years after she left, was advised by Al-Qaeda-affiliated cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. But congressional Republican leadership swiftly shut down Bachmann for alleging links between Abedin’s family and the Muslim Brotherhood. Abedin has said little about her upbringing in Jeddah, other than that her father instructed her to read a lot of English novels and that she watched Christiane Amanpour and decided to become a journalist. A former high-level State Department staffer, who worked closely with Abedin, said she never expressed any opinions about Middle Eastern politics or Islam, other than occasionally helping organize Muslim holiday celebrations at State. For its part, the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs describes itself as a scholarly journal that studies Muslim communities in non-Muslim societies: Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs is the only scholarly journal studying Muslim communities in non-Muslim societies. It provides a wealth of information about these communities that cannot be found anywhere else in documented form.  It has opened up a new area of specialization in minority studies with original articles addressing the minority condition from the historical, demographic, social and economic perspective. Our research interests extend to include non-Muslim minorities living in Muslim societies, interfaith dialogue with the objective of promoting understanding, and the study of Muslim minority women who face particular and complex challenges to their minority existence while maintaining their Islamic identity. The Journal has indeed pioneered the way in examining theoretical and conceptual issues that define and explain the minority experience. Arguments that the journal is “radical” often center on an article published in 2002 that allegedly “blamed” the United States for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The article has been quoted selectively, and the full version doesn’t appear to be readily available online, so it’s hard to gauge the article’s content from odd bits and pieces and partial quotes that have been posted. However, the opening of the article seems to indicate that it’s point is more nuanced than the general idea that “America is to blame for 9/11”: You can read more of the article in question here . So, it’s true that Huma Abedin worked as an editor of the publication for 12 years. But claims that the publication is “radical” depend on personal perspective. That’s why we’re classifying this one “mostly truth.” ","Politics"

"," It’s true that Rush Limbaugh accused President Obama of “attacking” rural states with lesbian farmers. Limbaugh made the allegations in an August 17th segment on his radio show in which he took issue with the Iowa LGBT Rural Summit event that was hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA describes its LGBT Summit Series and the corresponding #RuralPride campaign on its website as such: The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights, in collaboration with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and The True Colors Fund, will engage with LGBT rural communities across the country to host the LGBT Rural Summit Series. Each series will offer a unique opportunity for USDA and other federal agencies to share information relating to policies, programs, and services that exist to protect, promote and strengthen LGBT rural communities. Issues ranging from rural housing loans, community facility grants and bullying will be discussed. Each series will also include a strong presence from local nonprofit organizations, sharing USDA’s dedication to serving LGBT rural America. The Iowa LGBT Rural Summit event in question was held on August 18th in Des Moines. In his August 17th segment, Limbaugh said the Obama administration was using federal funds to breakup rural Republican strongholds: Rural America happens to be largely conservative. Rural America is made up of self-reliant, rugged individualist types. They happen to be big believers in the Second Amendment. So here comes the Obama Regime with a bunch of federal money and they’re waving it around, and all you gotta do to get it is be a lesbian and want to be a farmer and they’ll set you up. I’m like you; I never before in my life knew that lesbians wanted to be farmers. I never knew that lesbians wanted to get behind the horse and the plow and start burrowing. I never knew it. But apparently enough money it make it happen, and the objective here is to attack rural states. They’re already attacking suburbs, and that has been made perfectly clear by what happened in Milwaukee. They’re going after every geographic region that is known to be largely conservative. They never stop, folks. They are constantly on the march. So, it’s true that Rush Limbaugh said that Obama was sending lesbian farmers to invade liberal communities. ","Politics"
"The Media Is Lying: Trump is Actually Beating Clinton in Polls-Mostly Fiction!","2016-08-24 14:56:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/media-lying-trump-actually-beating-clinton-polls/"," The media is lying about the presidential election by oversampling Democrats in polls that show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump. "," There are valid arguments to be made about the accuracy of polling data, but claims that “the media is lying” don’t seem to check out. Rumors that the media was intentionally skewing the polls in Hillary Clinton’s favor cropped up after polls conducted by CBS News/New York Times and NBC News/Survey Monkey showed Clinton with a 6- and 7-point lead over Trump, respectively. The conservative website American Thinker argued that CBS News/New York Time had skewed its polling data by oversampling Democrats to incorrectly inflate Clinton’s support: However, based on the polling details, the final weighted sample of 976 registered voters is made up of just 28 percent Republicans and 35 percent Democrats. In the unweighted sample of registered voters, the relative percentage by party was 29 percent Republicans and 35 percent Democrats. So, during the weighting process, the poll increased the Democrat-Republican spread from 6 percent to 7 percent. This relative weighting should have been headed in the other direction. The Daily Mail made essentially the same argument about an NBC News/Survey Monkey poll that showed Clinton had opened up a 7-point lead over Trump: But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 per cent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans – the same margin as the poll’s topline result. Again, there are valid questions about the accuracy of these two polls. The specific argument that these polls are inaccurate because Democrats have been oversampled, however, doesn’t hold up. There are two main reasons for that. First, polls with large sample sizes are adjusted, or “weighted,” to more accurately reflect the electorate. Given that more people identify as Democrats than Republicans, polls are intentionally weighted so more Democrats are included than Republicans to more accurately reflect the population. Different polls show Democratic-leaning voters outweighing Republicans from anywhere from 5 to 11 percent, depending on timing and polling methods. So, the Daily Mail argument that the poll is misleading because 7 percent more Democrats were polled is flat wrong. The sample is weighted that way intentionally to reflect national political affiliation trends. And the American Thinker argument that the CBS News/New York Time poll is wrong because it was weighted 1 percent more in favor of Democrats than it should have been is misleading at best. The issue is that a number of factors go into weighing for party affiliation, so a 1-point swing one way or another isn’t necessarily a red flag that a poll is wrong. It could simply mean that pollsters are taking into account national factors or trends that haven’t yet been reflected in party affiliation data. PEW Research Center explains the concept of weighting for party affiliation like this: While it would be easy to standardize the distribution of Democrats, Republicans and independents across all of these surveys, this would unquestionably be the wrong thing to do. While all of our surveys are statistically adjusted to represent the proper proportion of Americans in different regions of the country; younger and older Americans; whites, African Americans and Hispanics; and even the correct share of adults who rely on cell phones as opposed to landline phones, these are all known, and relatively stable, characteristics of the population that can be verified off of U.S. Census Bureau data or other high quality government data sources. Party identification is another thing entirely. Most fundamentally, it is an attitude, not a demographic. To put it simply, party identification is one of the aspects of public opinion that our surveys are trying to measure, not something that we know ahead of time like the share of adults who are African American, female, or who live in the South. Particularly in an election cycle, the balance of party identification in surveys will ebb and flow with candidate fortunes, as it should, since the candidates themselves are the defining figureheads of those partisan labels. Thus there is no timely, independent measure of the partisan balance that polls could use for a baseline adjustment. So, in conclusion, claims that the media is oversampling Democrats in polls to make it appear that Donald Trump is losing badly to Hillary Clinton just don’t check out. But there are legitimate questions about these polls (and all national polls). Fivethirtyeight consistently grades various pollsters and scrutinizes their methods.

"Iran Executes Shahram Amiri After Clinton Email Leak-Reported as Fiction!","2016-08-23 10:21:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/iran-executes-shahram-amiri-clinton-email-leak-reported/"," U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Donald Trump claim Hillary Clinton’s “reckless” use of a private email server included references to a nuclear scientist named Shahram Amiri who was later executed. "," Shahram Amiri was hanged for treason for giving “vital information to the enemy” — but we couldn’t find a clear connection between Clinton’s emails and Amiri’s execution. Amiri went missing in 2009 after he traveled to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on a pilgrimage. He reappeared about a year later in a series of videos posted on YouTube. In the first video, Amiri said: “I was abducted on the 13th of Khordad 1388 (June 3, 2009) in a joint operation by terror and kidnap teams from the US intelligence service CIA and Saudi Arabia’s Istikhbarat [intelligence agency]. I was kidnapped from the holy city of Medina.” In a second vido, Amiri said he was in the United States on his own free will to study. In a third video, Amiri said that he had escaped from “U.S. Intelligence officers in Virginia” and that he was in “danger and could possibly be arrested again” by them. The Hill reports that U.S. officials confirmed at the time that Amiri had provided “useful information” to them. Then, in July 2010, Amiri showed up at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., and asked to be returned home to Iran, McClatchy reports : Amiri was “dropped off” at the Iranian interests section of the Pakistan embassy in Washington at 6:30 p.m. Monday, Abdul Basit, the spokesman for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad, told McClatchy. Because Iran and the United States do not have diplomatic relations, Pakistan handles Iranian interests in the U.S. “He was dropped there by someone,” said Basit. “He’s in the Iranian interests section, not in the Pakistan embassy per se. They are making arrangements to repatriate him.” The Iranian interests section is located in a separate building, some two to three miles from the Pakistan embassy, said Basit, and it is staffed by around eight Iranians. He said he did not know how Amiri got there or how he would be sent back to Iran. Separately, Iran’s state radio reported Tuesday that “Shahram Amiri took refuge at Iran’s interest section at the Pakistan embassy in Washington, wanting to return to Iran immediately.” Amiri, a university researcher who works for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, could have valuable information on the progress of Iran’s nuclear program. According to some reports, Amiri had defected to the U.S. and was helping the CIA. Shortly before Amiri showed up at the Pakistani Embassy, Iranian TV released Amiri’s videos and described as a nuclear scientist who had defected to the United States — which means that Iran was well aware of Amiri and his contacts with the CIA without any help from Hillary Clinton’s private email server. After that, reports of Amiri’s whereabouts quieted until August 2016. That’s when Iran’s Justice Ministry announced that he had been executed: Mohseni Ejei told reporters that Amiri had access to top secret information about the Islamic Republic of Iran and got linked to Iran’s number one enemy, the United States. Amiri had provided the enemy with vital information about Iran, the judiciary spokesman said. One of the cases in which Iran overpowered the US intelligence agency was the case of Shahram Amiri, Mohseni Ejei said, adding, ‘CIA thought that its movements were kept away from the eye of Iranian Intelligence Ministry.’ ‘They took Amiri to Saudi Arabia, thinking that we are not aware of,’ he said, adding that Iran was closely monitoring the plot. Noting that Amiri stood trial several times in presence of his defense lawyer, he said that Amiri appealed to the court of justice against the primary verdict which was death sentence. His appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court once again reviewed the charge brought against the defendant because the spies are in some cases sentenced to death and in other cases are subject to ten years in prison, Mohseni-Ejei said. Mohseni-Ejei said that family of the defentant believed that the verdict was 10 years in prison, but, he had received death penalty in the primary verdict and after the legal proceedings his verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court and he was finally put to death, Mohseni Ejei said. Following reports of Amiri’s death, Trump took to Twitter to link Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state to his death However, we haven’t found anything linking Amiri’s execution to Clinton’s use of a private email server. And, for what it’s worth, the State Department said that none of the Clinton emails about Amiri were classified, and that “This is not something that became public when the State Department released those emails.” In deed, it would appear that Iran was aware of Amiri’s contact with the U.S. as far back as 2010. Also, as the statement from Iran said, Amiri stood trial several times for treason, and that he had appealed his conviction, before the death sentence was carried out. So, the timeline of the legal system doesn’t jive with the idea that he was executed after Iranians saw his name in Clinton’s released emails. Given all that, we’re reporting the claim that Amiri was executed because of Clinton’s use of a private email server, or hacked emails, as fiction. ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton: Nurses Are Glorified Babysitters-Unproven!","2016-08-19 14:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-nurses-glorified-babysitters/"," A long-running rumor that Hillary Clinton once said that nurses were glorified babysitters or overpaid maids (depending on the version) resurfaced during the 2016 presidential contest. "," There are a number of different versions of Hillary Clinton’s commentary on nurses — but we couldn’t verify the authenticity of any of them. Clinton has been quoted as saying that “nurses are glorified babysitters” or “nurses are overpaid maids” or “nurses are overpaid and uneducated.” Although different, all of these comments carry the same message: nurses are under skilled, overvalued and overpaid. These rumors appear on message boards like All Nurses going all the way back to her first presidential bid in 2008. While many posts question whether or not Clinton actually said it, one such forum post is a little clearer, and is the only one that actually provides a source: I remember reading an article back when I worked in the neuro ICU where Hillary Clinton was quoted to say that nurses are under educated and over paid. I remember the nurses were so furious about it and posted the article of the pittsburgh post newspaper on the bulletin board so everyone could read it. This was during the 90’s so there is not internet documentation but you will find many nurses that remember it. We scoured the Pittsburgh Post archives (the paper is now the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ) for the source of the quote, but our search returned zero hits. During that search, however, we found a transcript of a 1993 town hall speech that Clinton delivered to the Democratic Governors Association in Woodstock, Illinois, while she was advocating for healthcare reform as first lady. In the speech, Clinton made a number of general statements about nurses, doctors and the healthcare system that could have been spun (right or wrong) into a commentary about nurses being “overpaid and undereducated.” In reference to nurses (and other medical professionals) having to earn their salaries Clinton said: We can no longer write a blank check for health care in this country. We will have to ask everyone — workers, employers, doctors, nurses , other health care providers, hospitals — to do their part. We’ll have to tell very other aspect of the health care industry that it can no longer expect to be raising its prices and profits growing at two to three to four to five to eight times the rate of inflation. We’re going to tell workers that if they do not do their part to be responsible users of health care, then we will never be able to adequately to rein-in costs. Clinton’s comments don’t exactly match the notorious commentary on nurses, but they could be shoehorned into the general idea that Clinton viewed nurses and doctors as being overpaid at the time. Clinton spoke to training and education for nurses at one point after she said that nurses spend half their time filling out forms: Doctors and nurses will finally be able to do what they were trained and educated to do — keeping people healthy, not filling out forms Again, the quote doesn’t exactly fit the commentary on nurses, but it relates generally to education and training of nurses. Finally, Clinton made one last references to doctors and nurses in her speech that relates generally to nursing wages and/or education: That is one of the most cost-effective things we can do — to encourage doctors and nurses and others to pay off their loans, to be forgiven for their loans, if they will go into areas that need their help . There is hardly a program that is more worthy of consideration than that, and it will be reinvigorated after being allowed basically to die on the vine over the last 12 years. If we make sure that all of our people are covered by integrated delivery networks like Governor Dean and others are talking about, then nobody, no matter where they live, will be without access to decent care. So, although the Clinton town hall speech from 1993 doesn’t exactly fit the narrative that she believes nurses are overpaid and uneducated, that’s the closest thing we could find. And, for what it’s worth, Clinton gave a glowing statement about the role of nurses in the healthcare community when the American Nurses Association endorsed her during the 2016 campaign: “Across the country, nurses provide vital medical care to countless Americans every year. They care for our families and friends, they comfort us in times of uncertainty and grief, and they maintain continuously high standards of medical practice. You won’t find a harder-working, more dedicated, and more trusted group of professionals anywhere. “As President, I will always stand with America’s nurses in the fight to finally achieve universal, affordable health care and fight against any efforts to roll back the protections and coverage of the Affordable Care Act. I will always stand with American workers to protect their rights and safety on the job. And I will fight to ensure that patients get the very best care, including by addressing the looming nursing shortage, investing substantially in tackling America’s substance use disorder crisis, and finally taking mental health as seriously as we do physical health.” Of course, that doesn’t mean that Clinton didn’t once call nurses glorified babysitters, overpaid maids or said that they were “over paid and under educated” — but we couldn’t find any proof that she actually said those things, either. That’s why we’re reporting this one as unproven. ","Politics"
"Trump: Harriet Tubman Belongs on Food Stamps-Fiction!","2016-08-19 13:20:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-harriet-tubman-belongs-food-stamps/"," A report that Donald Trump said Harriett Tubman’s face belongs on food stamps, not the $20 bill, has gone viral. "," You can chalk this false report up to a fake news website. The story appeared at TMZHipHop , a fake news website known for publishing satirical articles that are centered on hip hop culture, under the headline “Donald Trump Says Harriet Tubman Face Belongs on Foodstamps.” The report begins: Said Donald Trump who believes Harriet Tubman face is more deserving of a EBT card than a twenty dollar bill. Donald Trump posted to his Facebook page that he believes Harriet Tubman’s face belongs on a food stamp card and America needs to stop punking out to the pressure of minorities and groups. Contrary to that report, no such post appeared on Trump’s Facebook page, and we couldn’t find any record of him actually saying it. However, Trump did catch flake for his response to the Treasury Department’s announcement back in April that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Trump said Tubman was “fantastic” but suggested that she appear on the $2 bill in an appearance on NBC’s “Today” show: Andrew Jackson had a great history. I think it’s very rough when you take somebody off the bill. Andrew Jackson had a history of tremendous success for the country … Maybe we do the $2 bill or we do another bill … I don’t like seeing it. Yes, I think it’s pure political correctness. Been on the bill for many, many years and really represented — somebody that was really very important to this country. I would love to see another denomination, and that could take place. I think it would be more appropriate. So, although Trump did oppose the Treasury Department’s announcement that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, reports that Trump said Tubman should appear on a food stamp card is false.

"Vincent Fleck Found Dead After Hillary Clinton’s Medical Records Leaked-Fiction!","2016-08-16 08:55:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/vincent-fleck-found-dead-after-hillary-clintons-medical-records-leaked/"," Vincent Fleck, the father of a doctor who leaked Hillary Clinton’s medical information to the press, died suddenly and under suspicious circumstances. "," Rumors that Vincent Fleck’s death was related to Hillary Clinton’s leaked medical records is nothing more than unreliable Russian propaganda. The story went viral when fringe website What Does It Mean published a report on August 11, 2016, under the headline, “Father of Doctor Treating Hillary Clinton for Dementia Mysteriously Dies” that begins: The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that the continuing to grow list of mysterious deaths surrounding US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has increased after the father of the doctor treating her for dementia suddenly died this past weekend — and who is believed to have been behind the leaking of her most secret medical records. The SVR first became “alerted/alarmed” regarding the circumstances of this latest mysterious death associated with Hillary Clinton on 17 July, this report says, when a “known/suspected” Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) “hit team” traveled about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from their New York City “base/headquarters” to a small village named Mount Kisco, both being located in New York State. Upon arriving in Mount Kisco, this report continues, this CIA “hit team” broke into a specialized small computer security companies annex office named Right Click Solutions, located at 322 East Main Street, but were “shocked/surprised” by the unexpected arrival of an off duty employee—who immediately called the local police forces when he noticed the break in—and who were only able to obtain a single laptop computer. That stolen laptop computer, the report continues, was owned by Vincent Fleck, the father of Dr. Daniel Fleck, the doctor who is supposedly serving as Hillary Clinton for dementia. Clinton medical records supposedly revealing that the presidential candidate has dementia were leaked hours after his death. The report relies heavily on Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The primary mission of the SVR is to gather information and intelligence for Russia, and to influence the policies of public and private institutions in foreign countries, like America, according to a complaint filed after three SVR agents were detained in New York City in 2015. So, considering that SVR exists solely to advance Russian interests in foreign policy, it should not be considered a trusted source of intelligence or news. As we’ve seen in the past, SVR reports typically spin actual tidbits of news into large conspiracies that make sweeping and unsubstantiated claims about American politics. We investigated a previous (false) report from SVR that a Clinton hit team assassinated a top Democratic official, and a previous (false) report that President Obama had bought an extravagant mansion in Dubai. In those previous stories reports SVR spun factual reports into Russian propaganda — and the same is true in the case of Vincent Fleck’s death. It’s true that Fleck died suddenly on August 8th, but facts don’t support SVR claims that a Clinton hit team was behind his death. The 69-year-old died after suffering an unknown medical event while participating in the swimming portion of the Long Island Triathlon on August 7th, Fox News reports : A 69-year-old athlete competing in a New York triathlon on Sunday died during the swimming portion of the event. Authorities said Vincent Fleck, of Mount Kisco, died after a lifeguard noticed him in distress. Suffolk County police said a lifeguard brought him in a canoe to a rescue boat, where he received first aid. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The emergency occurred during the 500-meter swim portion of the Smith Point Spring Triathlon in Narrow Bay. Police said it was unknown if Fleck drowned or if he suffered a medical event. The Suffolk County Medical Examiner was set to do an autopsy to determine the cause of death. So, while the exact cause of Fleck’s death has yet to be released, early reports don’t support SVR’s theory that a hit team was behind his death. Also, there’s no proof that Dr. Fleck actually leaked information about Clinton’s health, or that he treated her. Given all that, and the lack of SVR’s credibility, it’s easy to call this one fiction. ","Politics"

"," Larry Nichols’ claims that he murdered people for the Clintons are unproven. Nichols made the claim that he worked as a hitman for the Clintons in an appearance on a fringe radio show in September 2013 (The Clintons) sent me overseas to kill people for them and told me it was for the good of the country. So, when they asked me to do it for them in the states, it felt no different. The real truth is, I did it for the money and I didn’t give a s*it about the women I beat and the men I murdered. There’s no way to confirm that Nichols’ story is true since it’s based entirely on first-person accounts. But, if Nichols had actually committed murders, it would seem to defy logic for him to admit to it on a radio show and risk prosecution. While serving as governor of Arkansas, Clinton hired Nichols to work as the marketing director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. Clinton fired him in 1988, however, for making unauthorized long-distance phone calls to Central America, allegedly to support the Contras in Nicaragua, the New York Times reported in 1997: Nichols, for his part, became convinced that Bill Clinton himself had some vague but sinister Central American connection during the time he was Governor. It’s a connection that in Nichols’s view involved cocaine shipments, money-laundering and gun-running, all in and around the Mena airport in western Arkansas while Clinton was Governor. Nichols sued Clinton to contest his firing. He charged not only that Clinton was remiss in not investigating Mena but also that he had misused state funds to romance five women. Nichols’ lawsuit, and claims that Clinton had used state funds to romance five women in particular, momentarily became a major issue during Clinton’s first presidential campaign. By January 1992, however, Nichols dropped the lawsuit and said the media “have made a circus out of this thing, it has gone way too far,” the Los Angeles Times reported in 1992: In his statement, Nichols said: “It is time to call the fight I have with Bill Clinton over. . . . I set out to destroy him for what I believed happened to me.” But Nichols didn’t actually call off the fight with the Clintons in 1992. From telling the Times that, “They may just kill me,” in 1997 to telling Alex Jones that he had vowed to stop Hillary in 2015, Nichols has remained a vocal opponent of the Clintons all along. And, given that there’s not proof beyond a personal account, we’re calling Nichols’ claims that he murdered people for the Clintons “unproven.” ","Politics"
"Do You Remember 1987? Oliver North’s Warning About Osama bin Laden-Fiction!","2016-08-09 15:20:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/remember-1987-oliver-norths-warning-osama-bin-laden/"," A forwarded email claims that Lt. Col. Oliver North, a national security aid under President Reagan, warned then-Senator Al Gore about Osama bin Laden during an Iran-Contra hearing in 1987. "," Oliver North didn’t warn Al Gore (or anyone else) about Osama bin Laden in 1987. That rumor has been circulating in a forwarded email for years. The email includes a transcript of an exchange between North and Al Gore, a senator from Tennessee at the time, during a congressional hearing on the Iran-Contra scandal. In that exchange, Gore supposedly mocked North for installing a $60,000 home security system, and North confessed that he had done so because he had been threatened by a terrorist named Osama bin Laden: At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn’t pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn’t. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. ‘Why are you so afraid of this man?’ the senator asked. ‘Because, sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of ‘ Ollie answered. ‘And what do you recommend we do about him?’ asked the senator. ‘Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.’ The senator disagreed with this approach. And, that was all that was shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore. Like many false rumors, this one contains a kernel of truth. North testified about an expensive home security system that he’d installed during a joint House-Senate hearing on the Iran-Contra investigation on July 7, 1989. However, it was committee counsel John Nields — not Gore — who questioned him about it. Also, North named Abu Nida, not bin Laden, as the terrorist who’d threatened his life, according to a post to the official Senate’s “ reference desk ” page: Oliver North testified about a home security system during a July 7, 1987 joint Senate-House hearing on the Iran-Contra investigation. The questioner was not a senator, but committee counsel John Nields. Col. North testified the security system was installed because threats were made on his life by terrorist Abu Nidal. Turns out, North’s security system was an important subject for the joint committee because it was paid for using proceeds from Iran arms sales. Glenn Robinette, a retired CIA officer, testified that he prepared false bills for the $13,900 security system to help hide the nature of transactions. The system was actually paid for by Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, and the money came from a bank account that included profits generated by secret sales of U.S. arms to Iran, the New York Times reported in 1987. North testified that he wrote two backdated letters that were intended to fit Robinette’s false bills, and that fabricating those letters was “the grossest misjudgment that I have made in my life.” The committee’s final report details the exchange with North in great detail: So, bits and pieces of this rumor are true, but the larger claim that Gore laughed off North’s concerns about bin Laden are false. In fact, Gore was not even listed as a member of the committee that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal, so he would not have questioned North during the hearing. ","Politics"

She told them that her name was “Becca” and that she worked for the DNC. Id. 4. They did not ask her for and she did not give them her last name or her title. Id. They similarly did not ask whether she was authorized to accept process for either Defendant, and she did not make any representations to that effect. Id. They handed her the documents and left. Reports of Lucas’s unexpected death, coupled with his role as a public challenger of both Clinton and the DNC, sparked conspiracy theories among right-wing media outlets. Zero Hedge (incorrectly) reported that Lucas was the “lead attorney” in the anti-fraud lawsuit. He was actually a process server who worked at Once Source Process in Washington, D.C. The Zero Hedge story , which appeared under the headline, “Lead Attorney in Anti-Clinton DNC Fraud Case Mysteriously Found Dead,” was shared more than 25,000 times within days of being published. At this point it’s clear that Lucas died unexpectedly and tragically on August 2nd. Beyond that, no details about the cause or manner of his death have been made available, so any theories about his death are unproven.

"Interesting New Yorker Story on Donald Trump-Incorrect Attribution!","2016-08-04 14:08:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/interesting-new-yorker-read-donald-trump/"," An article written by Roy Kaplan that supposedly appeared in the New Yorker says that Donald Trump is a “giant middle finger from average Americans to the political and media establishment.” "," This commentary wasn’t published by the New Yorker . Forwarded emails of the story that began making the rounds in early 2016 claimed that it was penned by an unnamed “political correspondent for Bloomberg” and was published in the New Yorker on February 1, 2016. But the article was actually written by Don Fredrick, a vocal critic of President Obama who publishes his commentaries at his fringe website, The Complete Obama Timeline. The general gist of the article, which was published in December 2015, is that Trump is a symbol of working class Americans rejecting political and media elites, as explained in its opening sentence: The better question may be, “What is Donald Trump?” The answer: A giant middle finger from average Americans to the political and media establishment. Even though this particular article was not published in the New Yorker , however, an article with a similar theme — voters giving the finger to the political establishment by supporting Trump — was published in the magazine in November 2015. The commentary, which was written by James Surowiecki and appeared on the magazine’s “Financial Page,” begins: Donald Trump’s campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again!” A better one might be “Only in America.” You could not ask for a better illustration of the complexity of ordinary Americans’ attitudes toward class, wealth, and social identity than the fact that a billionaire’s popularity among working-class voters has given him the lead in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination . In a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, Trump was the candidate of choice of a full third of white Republicans with no college education. Working-class voters face stagnant wages and diminished job prospects, and a 2014 poll found that seventy-four per cent of them think “the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy.” Why on earth would they support a billionaire? In the end, both stories summarize support for Trump as a stand against the political establishment and elitism — but the stories are very different, and Fredrick’s commentary has been incorrectly attributed to the New Yorker.

"Veteran Chris Mark Wrote an Open Letter to Khizr Khan-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-08-04 13:35:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/veteran-chris-mark-wrote-open-letter-khizr-khan/"," Chris Mark, a Marine veteran, has written an open letter to Gold Star father Khizr Khan. "," We can confirm that a veteran named Chris Mark wrote this open letter to Khizr Khan — but Mark later wrote an apology to Khan and other Gold Star parents. Mark published the letter at his website, Global Risk Info , on July 31st. Mark, a service disabled veteran, manages the site to “discuss various security and risk management topics.” Mark also owns Mark Consulting Group, which specializes in providing a range of information services to its clients. Mark describes his military career in a biography that appears on the company’s website: Prior to joining the civilian sector, Mr. Mark served in both the United States Marine Corps where he operated as a Force Reconnaissance Marine, Marine Scout/Sniper, Security Forces Marine, and in the US Navy where he was selected to serve as a Navy SEAL Officer before a training injury ended his career. Mr. Mark is a combat veteran of Operation Continue Hope, Mogadishu, Somalia and served as the training officer of the Marine Basic Reconnaissance Course.  He has attended numerous military schools including; Marine Combat Training, Marine Infantry, Marine Scout/Sniper, SOTG Urban Sniper, SOTG Urban Reconnaissance & Surveillance, US Army Airborne, US Army Pathfinder, US Navy Scuba, Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance, HRST Master, and Marine Security Forces, among others. Following Khizr Khan’s speech at the Democratic National Convention, Mark penned a response in the form of an open letter to Khan. The letter begins: I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son’s sacrifice for this great nation.  By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful. As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger.  The United States has a military comprised of volunteers.  Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve.  There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.  It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights.  I found your comments troubling when you said: “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.” Mark took exception with Khan’s statement that Donald Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” — and he questioned whether Hillary Clinton had: Does it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed “…nothing and no one?”…has Ms. Clinton “..sacrificed” for this nation?  How about Mr. Obama?   Your comment stating that Mr. Trump “…has sacrifice no one” is alarming.  Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed?  Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself.   As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own.  He was not forced to serve. Mark also called Khan’s characterization of Trump’s statements to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country “wrong and disingenuous”: As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ” “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,”The irony of your son’s own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored.  I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people.  In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car.  Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect “his people”…’his soldiers’….’his fellow Americans’… Mark’s open letter quickly went viral and was re-printed by major media outlets like FOX News. On August 3rd, however, Mark published an apology to Khan. He stated that his views that “Captain Khan’s sacrifice was his own” did not align with the beliefs of many Gold Star families: Recently, I wrote an ‘Open Letter’ to Mr. Khizr Khanthat generated quite a bit of controversy.  I had referenced that Captain Khan’s sacrifice was his own.  In reading numerous Gold Star family comments from both sides of the isle, I believe an apology to the Khan family, Mrs. Smith and all Gold Star Families is in line. I was hopeful that I would have had the opportunity to make this last night in a more public forum but I was unable. While I personally do believe Captain Khan’s sacrifice was his own, I have learned that my own position on this issue does not reflect the views of many Gold Star Families.  I should have been more circumspect in my comments and taken more time to understand the feelings of those families before opining.  There is no other way to say it: I am sorry and I have learned. I want to thank those who took the time to comment directly and professionally to allow me to see both sides of this very sensitive position. ","Politics"

"," No author is identified for this open letter, so it’s impossible to confirm that it was actually written by the mother of an active-duty soldier. The open letter from a Blue Star mom to Khizr Khan first appeared at 100% Fed Up , a website that focuses on “exposing the lies of the left,” on August 1st. The post appears under the headline, “Mother of Active Duty Soldier Destroys Hillary’s Anti-Trump Muslim Dad with this Viral Letter,” and begins with a brief introduction: Only a military mom could write such a fantastic testimony and rebuke to the Muslim pawn used by Hillary’s campaign at the Dem Convention to trash Donald Trump. The Facebook letter below is so great and so powerful that it’s gone viral. We hope you will read and share because it’s time to support our military 100% in this war against terror! The letter begins by extending sympathies for the loss of their son, U.S. Army Captain Hamuyan Khan, at the hands of a suicide bomber in Iraq in 2004. Then, tone shifts dramatically: That being said….while your son is a hero, you Sir, are NOT. My son has served three tours of combat in the countries you and your family came from. Iraq and Afghanistan were his introduction to adulthood and service to something bigger than our individual selves. He was blown up by an IED set by your countrymen. His Purple Heart is a testament to his love of America and our freedoms. I have suffered through his multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan….never knowing from moment to moment if he would return home in a flag draped coffin. The letter’s author goes on to say that she would never use her son’s death “as a pawn piece” to support Hillary Clinton: The same woman that says vile things to her military details there to protect her. You, Sir, are supposed to be a witness to your son’s bravery and sacrifice. Instead you stood on a stage and promoted the woman that upholds the very people that killed your son. You became a political PAWN that promotes pandering to our enemy. You desecrated your son’s memory by your words. The letter then takes issue with Khan’s challenge for Donald Trump to read the constitution, noting that Khan’s wife “stood with her head covered, never uttering a word about her loss … as would any good Sharia wife and mother.” It should be noted, however, that Ghazala Khan has denied claims that she wasn’t allowed to speak because of her Muslim beliefs in an op-ed published in the Washington Post . She wrote: I cannot walk into a room with pictures of Humayun. For all these years, I haven’t been able to clean the closet where his things are — I had to ask my daughter-in-law to do it. Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak? In the end, it’s impossible for us to confirm who wrote this open letter to Khizr Khan because no author is provided, and we weren’t able to locate the original Facebook post that 100% Fed Up took the open letter from. We’ll update the story if more information becomes available. ","Politics"

"," Tom Hanks said that America “could withstand” a Donald Trump presidency — but the actor did not endorse Trump. Rumors that Hanks had rallied his support behind Trump started with an article that appeared at Conservative 101 , a website that publishes fake news articles with a right-wing slant. The story, which appeared under the headline, “Tom Hanks Backs Donald Trump, Destroys Hollywood Libs Who Criticize Him with These 9 Heroic Words,” reports : How much do you love Tom Hanks? This abundantly talented, deeply charming actor has been thrilling audiences and moving them to tears for more than three decades now. He’s earned the trust of Americans as a decent, grounded person with a great deal of humanity and common sense. In the snake pit that is Hollywood and the liberal media, he is a beacon of decency. So it will likely not surprise you to learn which candidate Hanks plans to vote for in November: Republican nominee Donald Trump. After being published on July 29th, the story quickly spread across social media. The story was especially effective in deceiving people because it included a quote that Hanks actually made about Trump to CBS News back in April: “America’s going to be fine. We’re the greatest, most resilient nation in the history of, of civilized, in all of civilization. We’ve worked ourselves out of holes many, many times over and over again.” Taken out of context, Hanks appeared to endorse Trump with the quote. But Hanks’ was simply saying that he believed America could survive a Trump presidency, the Hollywood Reporter reports : “We’re the greatest, most resilient nation in all of civilization,” the Oscar-winning actor said Thursday on CBS This Morning. “We’ll be fine.” When the 59-year-old Hanks stopped by the studio to promote his latest film, A Hologram for the King, he was asked about the 2016 election thus far and his thoughts on Trump in the White House. “We’ve worked ourselves out of holes many, many times over and over again,” Hanks said. When asked if that meant he thought Trump would be harmful to the nation, Hanks responded, “I have no powers of clairvoyance like you geniuses in the news media.” “I’m not saying he’s going to be president of the United States,” Hanks added. “I’m going to say that we’re going to have the most hilarious September, October and first week of November in a very long, long time. And you [media] people are going to be exhausted.” Tom Hanks was even clearer about his feelings on Donald Tump and his presidential prospects at a movie premier in England, Vulture report s: “Here’s the problem: America’s already great, so I don’t know what he is talking about,” Hanks said at the London premiere of A Hologram for the King on Monday. “I think that man will be president of the United States right about the time spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs in red capes.”","Politics"

"," It’s true that a website for Khizr Khan’s law firm was deleted on August 2nd, but the website didn’t prove that he profited from Muslim migration to the United States. Breitbart reported that Khizr Khan went into “panic mode” after gaining national attention following a speech at the Democratic National Convention in which he was critical of Donald Trump and deleted his law firm’s website. The reason for that, the website speculated, was to conceal “that he financially benefits from unfettered pay-to-play Muslim migration into America.” First, we’ll start with what we know to be true. The “KM Khan Law Office” website was deleted sometime before 10:17 p.m. on August 2nd. Earlier that day, the Wayback Machine took a snapshot of the site — and a snap shop taken at 10:17 p.m. showed that it had since been deleted . Here’s how the website appeared before it was taken down: Breitbart took issue part of Khan’s website that listed “E2 Treaty Investors, EB5 Investments & Related Immigration Services” as one of his areas of practices. The site reported that the EB5 program “helps wealthy foreigners usually from the Middle East essentially buy their way into America.” However, those claims a are false. Immigrant entrepreneurs are admitted into the United States to generate economic growth and create jobs through the EB5 program — but recipients of visas through the program are not “usually from the Middle East,” as Breitbart claims. In fact, they’re rarely from the Middle East, or from countries with predominately Muslim populations. A 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service shows that China accounts for the vast majority of EB5 visas (83.5%). The only Middle Eastern country listed in the top 10 is Iran, and Iranian immigrants accounted for just 0.6 percent of EB5 visas from 2005-2009: It seems that Breitbart and other outlets tried to use Khan’s legal work on EB5 visas to prove that he profits from Muslim migration to the U.S. — but that link doesn’t check out. So, it’s true that Khan’s website was suddenly deleted on August 2nd — but the claim that Khan’s website proved that he profited from Muslim migration to the United States is false. UPDATE: Khan said he took down his website because he had gotten “ugly messages” and feared that it would be hacked, the Wall Street Journal reports . ","Politics"
"Tim Kaine’s VP Selection is Payback for Resigning DNC Chair-Unproven!","2016-07-29 14:15:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tim-kaines-vp-selection-payback-resigning-dnc-chair/"," A popular theory that Tim Kaine, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton manipulated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to ensure that Clinton would win the 2016 presidential nomination has gone viral. "," There’s no proof that  Tim Kaine, Debbie Wasserman Shultz and Hillary Clinton rigged the DNC to ensure Clinton would win the party’s nomination in 2016. That theory works like this: Tim Kaine agreed to resign as DNC chair in 2011 so that former Clinton campaign co-manager Debbie Wasserman Schultz could assume the role and rig the system to ensure a Clinton nomination in 2016. In exchange, the theory goes, Kaine was promised the VP spot on Clinton’s presidential ticket. The series of events described above ring true, but press reports from the time indicate that President Obama — not Clinton — was the driving force behind both Kaine’s resignation from the DNC chair and Wasserman Schultz’s appointment. Kaine became the chairman of the DNC in early 2009. Although he was reluctant to accept the partisan post, the Washington Post reports , “Kaine was heavily courted by Obama in the final weeks of 2008.” Kaine remained DNC chair until 2011, when he announced he would run for Virginia’s open Senate seat. Again, the Los Angeles Times reports , Kaine was hesitant to run for the Senate, but, “Obama himself emerged as one of his top boosters, and he told Democratic donors just last week that Kaine would be an ‘outstanding senator’ if he chose to run.” After Kaine’s resignation, the DNC sent out an email on April 5, 2011, that “announced (Obama’s) choice of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to lead the DNC as it its newest chair,” referring to her as, “the right person for the job.” There’s no proof that Clinton was involved in the transition from Kaine to Wasserman Schultz. There’s also no proof that Clinton, Kaine and Wasserman Schultz conspired to rig the 2016 Democratic primaries in Clinton’s favor. That’s why we’re reporting this one as unproven. ","Politics"
"DNC Hired Actors to Fill Seats at Convention-Unproven!","2016-07-28 17:24:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dnc-hired-actors-fill-seats-convention/"," About 700 actors were hired to fill seats at the Democratic National Convention after delegates staged a walkout, according to a Craigslist ad that turned up. "," We can’t confirm whether or not this Craigslist ad was actually created by the Democratic National Committee, or if seat fillers were used to give the appearance of party unity. Those rumors cropped up after a Craigslist ad appeared in the Philadelphia area the day after Bernie Sanders supporters and delegates staged a walkout at the DNC. The post, which appeared under the headline, “Actors Needed For National Convention,” reads: Looking for 700 people to be utilized as actors during the National Convention. We currently have a number of empty seats that will need to be filled as we are currently removing a number of people and need to refill their seats for the remainder of the conference. You will be paid $50.00 each night for the remainder of the convention. You will be required to cheer at all times and will be asked to dress properly and possibly wear some promotional material. The ad quickly went viral. Websites like Infowars , Townhall and Twitchy all ran stories that claimed seat fillers to make it appear that the party had unified in support of nominee Hillary Clinton. Those stories included videos that were posted by people at the DNC who said they had personally witnessed seat fillers flooding the arena. In one instance, a woman posted a video of her standing next to a man who explained: He just came down from above, in the nose bleed section, and because our people, the Bernie people, went out to do a press conference, he was just given a credential … and he came (down) to be a seat filler. The man doesn’t provide his name in the video, so it’s impossible to verify why he was at the DNC and the sequence of events described by the woman. So, when it comes to rumors that actors were hired to fill seats at the DNC, there’s no firm evidence to prove or disprove the claim. But it seems that these rumors have exaggerated the number of Bernie Sanders supporters who walked out. ABC News reported that about 150 delegates walked out. Politico reported that “more than 100” Bernie Sanders supporters walked out. Given that there were exactly 4,763 delegates on the floor of the DNC, 100-150 of them walking out wouldn’t have had that big of an impact on the crowd size, or how full the arena appeared on TV. In the end, we can’t confirm whether this rumor is truth or fiction. ","Politics"
"Michelle Obama: Slaves Built the White House-Mostly Truth!","2016-07-27 13:25:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama-slaves-built-white-house/"," During her speech at the Democratic National Convention, First Lady Michelle Obama said that slaves built the White House. "," Michelle Obama’s claim that slaves built the White House is true. During her speech on the opening night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama was discussing the significance of Hillary Clinton becoming the first female presidential nominee for a major political party when she said: That is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to this stage tonight, the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. Michelle Obama’s speech immediately sparked a national debate about whether or not slaves built the White House, and, if so, what significance that carries. The White House Historical Association confirmed that slaves did in fact build the White House after efforts to recruit laborers from Europe to build the White House and other public buildings in Washington, D.C., fell short in 1792: Construction on the President’s House began in 1792 in Washington, D.C., a new capital situated in sparsely settled region far from a major population center. The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states-Virginia and Maryland-ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American—enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings. Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government’s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President’s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations. The White House Historical Association went one step further and posted a payroll to slaveowners that “shows the government did not own slaves, but it did hire them from their masters” to build the White House: Of course, the original “president’s house” didn’t stand long. British invaders took control of Washington, D.C., for 26 hours in 1814 and burned down nearly all of the public buildings there, including the original White House. Remains of the fire that destroyed the original president’s house, as it was called, can still be seen today, the White House Historical Association reports : After a night and a day of torching nearly all of the public buildings, and even a few private businesses, including ropewalks, which sent billowing clouds of choking black smoke over the capital, the British withdrew to their ships, afraid that their path of retreat might by blocked by American troops. The occupation of Washington by British troops lasted about twenty-six hours, but evidence of their vandalism survives to this day. Some of the blocks of Virginia sandstone that make up the original walls of the White House are clearly defaced with black scorch marks. They are the indelible strains from the fires of 1814. President James Madison immediately set out to rebuild the White House exactly as it was, and he hired the original architect, James Hoban, to oversee its reconstruction from 1814-1817, the White House Museum reports : When restoration was completed in 1817 under President James Monroe, it was furnished in fashionable style, some of which remains today in the Blue Room. He ordered a suite of French mahogany furniture through the American firm Russell and La Farge, with offices in Le Havre, France. However, the firm shipped gilded furniture instead, asserting that “mahogany is not generally admitted into the furniture of a Salon, even at private gentlemen’s houses.” Eight pieces of the original suite can be seen, including a bergère, an armchair with enclosed sides. A gilded bronze clock also remains. A few walls survived, but the White House had to be otherwise completely rebuilt. It’s often said that the White House was painted white after the fire to hide the scorch marks. We weren’t able to track down on any information about whether or not slaves were involved in the rebuilding of the White House. But, as Michelle Obama said, slaves were definitely involved in building the original White House. That’s why we’re classifying this one “mostly true.” ","Politics"

"," Claims about Tim Kaine’s connections to radical Islam are true, false and misleading. Those rumors started with a report by Breitbart that appeared under the headline, “Clinton VP Pick Tim Kaine’s Islamist Ties” that makes three specific claims about Kaine. We took a look at all three claims: Tim Kaine Appointed Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Suspect to State Immigration Commission- Truth! & Fiction! Tim Kaine appointed Dr. Esam Omeish to serve on the Virginia Commission on Immigration while Kaine served as the state’s governor in 2007. Omeish resigned a month later after a video from a political rally in 2000 surfaced that showed him calling for support of the “jihad way.” Another video showed Omeish call for a crowd gathered for at a Jerusalem Day rally in December 2000 to stand with Muslims fighting in the Middle East. In the video, Omeish says, After requesting Omeish’s resignation, Kaine said in a statement that, “Dr. Omeish is a respected physician and community leader, yet I have been made aware of certain statements he has made which concern me. Dr. Omeish indicated he did not want this controversy to distract from the important work of the commission.” The American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) said in a statement that it was “unfortunate” that Kaine did not thoroughly vet Omeish prior to his appointment to the commission: Many of Dr. Omeishﾒs statements and activities in the past have in fact been a manifestation of political Islam and his attempt to use the Muslim community as a tool in a specific Islamist political agenda. This not only violates the core principles of the separation of religion and politics, which is a cornerstone of our nation, but is in fact the main mechanism of influence of transnational Islamism. His public advocacy of  jihad in the Middle East by co-religionists implicitly via terrorist organizations like Hezbullah or HAMAS against Israel, an ally of the United States, should certainly highlight the toxicity of Islamism as a political ideology — regardless of the ideological jujitsu one uses to define ‘jihad’. For his part, Omeish denied that he had advocated for violence, saying, “In Islam, jihad is a broad word that means constant struggle — struggling spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, physically — in all respects. So my words were in support of people who are resisting occupation and people who are trying to . . . remove oppression from their land.” So, while it’s true that Omeish resigned from the immigration commission after videos came to light of him making controversial comments about jihad, the claim that Omeish himself was suspected of terrorism is false. That claim appears to stem from his involvement with the Muslim American Society (MAS) — and allegations that the group has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Omeish served as president of multiple regional chapters of MAS, and he also served on its national board of trustees, according to his website . However, MAS denies any current ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The group, which was founded in 1993, acknowledges that the Muslim Brotherhood (or Ikhawan) played an influential part in post-colonial Muslim history, and, as a result, literature written by Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been used to form the foundation of MAS: The Ikhwan are an influential part of post-colonial Muslim history, and have given rise to many prominent Muslim thinkers. This naturally resulted in the literature of those Islamic movements becoming the foundational texts for the intellectual component for Islamic work in America. We believe this had the advantage of protecting the majority of Muslims from extremist ideologies. With Muslims establishing themselves more and more as an integral part of American society, there was a need for an ongoing effort to re-evaluate the literature. This resulted in a re-examination of various authors and their contributions to the legacy. The outcome was the realization that the majority of what was written by Hassan al-Banna can be categorized as foundational thought (e.g. balanced understanding of Islam, societal reform, peaceful change, etc.) while a part of what he wrote may have been applicable to his time and place, but not to Muslims in America. MAS is not listed as a terrorist organization by the State Department. Beside that, we could not find any official documents to support the claim that Omeish was suspected of terrorism. Tim Kaine Spoke At Dinner Honoring Muslim Brotherhood Terror Suspect- Truth! & Misleading! While running for the Senate in 2011, Tim Kaine spoke before the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) during a “Candidate Night” dinner hosted by the organization. Kaine was among “46 Democratic and Republican politicans making their pitch for election or reelection to state offices” during the dinner, IIIT reported in a 2011 press release about the dinner. And, as the former governor of Virginia, Kaine was invited to speak at the dinner. At the Candidate Night dinner, Dr. Jamal Barzingi, a man who was reportedly instrumental in establishing the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence in the United States, was honored with IIIT’s lifetime achievement award, according to the press release. Barzingi’s obituary (he died in 2015) reports that he was the president of the Muslim Students Association (MSA) in “its early days.” During that time, the Washington Post reported in 2004 , Bazingi shaped the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence in Egyptian elections: The life story of one of the IIIT network’s leaders illustrates the key role it has played in the global politics of the Ikhwan. Jamal M. Barzinji fled his native Iraq in 1969 when the Baathist regime started executing fellow Islamists. An engineering student and top MSA leader, he joined MSA associates in 1971 to host the top leaders of the Egyptian Brotherhood, just released from 16 years in prison, for two weeks of meetings in Indiana. He and other then-MSA leaders helped persuade the Egyptian brothers to try participating in Egyptian elections as an alternative to underground struggle , he said. “It was one of our main contributions to the Ikhwan movement worldwide,” he said. He and his associates likewise have hosted many other Islamist leaders here over the years to “show them how wrong they are in being anti-American,” Barzinji said. But again, there’s no indication that Barzinji was suspected of terrorism. In fact, Barzinji actively worked with Republican strategist and thought leader Grover Norquist to help Republicans win over Muslim voters. Norquist later said the Muslim vote won the presidency for George W. Bush in 2000. And Kaine’s appearance at the IIIT Candidate Night dinner has been mischaracterized. Kaine and nearly 50 other politicians from Virginia were in attendance that night to court support for their campaigns, which isn’t out of the ordinary. Tim Kaine Accepted Islamist Financial Support- Truth! & Fiction ! Claims that Tim Kaine accepted funding from an Islamist are a mixed bag of truth and fiction. The Breitbart article correctly states that Barzingi’s group, IITC, donated $10,000 to New Dominion PAC in 2011 — and that New Dominion PAC donated $43,050 to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign from 2003-2005. So, clearly, Kaine received contributions from New Dominion PAC more than six years before IITC donated $10,000 to the PAC. That connection between IITC and Kaine’s political career doesn’t check out. Kaine did receive $7,800 from American Islamic organizations from 2011-2012, according to the Islamist Money in Politics database . But that’s not very unusual. Candidates from both parties are listed as having received donations from Islamic groups (even though Democrats usually receive more), so it doesn’t prove much. In conclusion, claims about Tim Kaine’s “longstanding ties” to radical Islam are a mixed bag of truth and fiction. It seems, however, that tidbits of truth have often been manipulated and misconstrued to support the larger narrative that Kaine has radical Islamic ties. ","Politics"
"Hillary Clinton Had Seizures on Camera-Reported as Fiction!","2016-07-25 10:11:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-seizures-camera/"," A video clip that apparently shows Hillary Clinton suffering a seizure on the campaign trail has raised questions about her health. "," Claims that video shows Hillary Clinton having a seizure on the campaign trail appear to be false. Theories that Hillary Clinton suffered a seizure on the campaign trail, or that she was suffering visible side effects from a stroke, went viral on websites like Reddit and 4chan . Users debated whether a video of Hillary Clinton doing impromptu interviews in a lobby in June captured her having a seizure. Those theories went mainstream after the website Conservative Outfitters reported that theories about the video had raised questions about Hillary Clinton’s health: It’s worth noting Hillary Clinton’s health has been on voter’s minds for a while now. Hillary is frequently seen suffering from violent coughing fits on the campaign trail. Sometimes the violent coughing fits leave her unable to speak for minutes at a time. Watch the two videos below showing both angles and decided for yourself. Did Hillary Clinton have a seizure? What do you think? Is Hillary Clinton healthy enough to be Commander-in-chief? But it seems obvious for a number of reasons that Hillary Clinton did not have a seizure in the video. After responding to a question about President Obama’s endorsement of her, a reporter loudly asked a question about who her vice presidential running mate would be. Clinton responded by nodding her head in mock surprise and shock and brushed off the question by holding up her coffee and saying, “You’ve got to try the iced chai,” to laughter. These types of rumors aren’t new, either. Theories about the condition of Hillary Clinton’s brain have been around since she suffered a concussion in December 2012. After Bill Clinton revealed that it took Hillary six months to get over the brain injury, Republican strategist Karl Rove stoked rumors that Clinton had suffered brain damage in the fall ( he later retracted the claim ).

"," Reports that Malik Obama plans to vote for Donald Trump in November are true. Rumors that President Obama’s half-brother said he would vote for Trump started with a New York Post report that was published under the headline, “Why Obama’s Half-Brother Says He’ll Be Voting for Donald Trump” that was published on July 24th. The story reports that Malik Obama plans to vote for Trump because “he speaks from the heart” and because he as “deep disappointment” in President Obama’s time in office: Obama, 58, a longtime Democrat, said his “deep disappointment” in his brother Barack’s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to “the party of Lincoln.” Barack Obama is seen with his half-brother, Malik.Photo: AP The last straw, he said, came earlier this month when FBI Director James Comey recommended not prosecuting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her use of a private e-mail servers while secretary of state. “She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,” said Obama. He’s also annoyed that Clinton and President Obama killed Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, whom he called one of his best friends. Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were “making this world a better place.” “I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn’t make things any better in Libya,” he said. “My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard.” But Malik Obama said that what bothers him the most about the Democratic Party is it’s support of same-sex marriage: “I feel like a Republican now because they don’t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,” he said. Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage — so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred. “That’s personal,” he said. Follow-up reports confirmed Malik Obama’s plans to vote for Donald Trump in No November. Malike Obama confirmed in an interview with Reuters that he agreed with Trump’s stance on Muslims — even though Malik is a Muslim himself: Malik, a U.S. citizen, has lived in Washington since 1985 where he worked with various firms before becoming an independent financial consultant. Trump’s stance against Muslims coming in to the United States was understandable even to Muslims like himself, Malik said. “I’m a Muslim, of course, but you can’t have people going around just shooting people and killing people just in the name of Islam,” he said. He criticized President Obama’s record in the White House saying he had not done much for the American people and his extended family despite the high expectations that accompanied his election in 2008, both in the United States and Kenya. So, given that multiple sources have reported that Malik Obama plans to vote for Donald Trump in November, we’re calling this one “truth.” ","Politics"

"," Pope Francis hasn’t endorsed Donald Trump. That rumor started with a story that appeared at the fake news website WTOE 5 News under the headline, “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement.” The statement that the Pope supposedly released reads: “I have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See. A strong and free America is vitally important in maintaining a strong and free world and in that sense what happens in American elections affects us all. The Rule of Law is the backbone of the American government as it is in any nation that strives for freedom and I now fear that the Rule of Law in America has been dealt a dangerous blow. The FBI, in refusing to recommend prosecution after admitting that the law had been broken on multiple occasions by Secretary Clinton, has exposed itself as corrupted by political forces that have become far too powerful. Though I don’t agree with Mr. Trump on some issues, I feel that voting against the powerful political forces that have corrupted the entire American federal government is the only option for a nation that desires a government that is truly for the people and by the people.  For this primary reason I ask, not as the Holy Father, but as a concerned citizen of the world that Americans vote for Donald Trump for President of the United States.” The story was quickly shared nearly 70,000 times on Facebook.

"A Secretary Without Honor by Philip Jennings-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-07-20 11:29:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/secretary-without-honor-philip-jennings/"," Phillip Jennings, a former Marine Corps pilot, recounts how a Marine captain owned up to the mistake of leaving a nuclear codes booklet unsecured in the 1960s, damaging his career, and compared the tale to Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. "," Key details of Philip Jennings’ story about a Marine captain who took responsibility for unattended nuclear codes don’t check out, but we can’t prove with certainty that this one is truth or fiction. Philip Jennings’ column appeared under the headline “Secretary Without Honor” in June. After USA Today published the column in its online op-ed section, the story made the rounds in forwarded emails and discussion forums. Jennings recounts that he was the air liaison officer for a battalion of Marines aboard 11 ships in the Mediterranean in the mid 1960s. As officer and senior captain, Jennings writes, he had a rotating responsibility for a nuclear code book that was kept in the operations room of the lead amphibious squadron ship. Jennings wrote that he shared the responsibility with Captain Leonard F. Chapman III, who was the son of a “high-ranking” Marine. The captain’s father was Gen. Leonard F. Chapman Jr. , the former commandant of the Marine Corps. Jennings writes that Captain Chapman mistakenly left the nuclear code book unattended for “seconds,” and returned to find the operations sergeant looking at the code book. Jennings continues: Against all regulations, the code book had been out of the safe and unattended. It mattered not that it was unattended for only seconds, that the ship was 5 miles at sea, or that it was certain no one unauthorized had seen the code. The captain could have explained this to the operations sergeant. He could have told the sergeant that he “would take care of it.” He could have hinted that his high-ranking dad could smooth it over. But the Marine Corps’ values are honor, courage and commitment. Honor is the bedrock of our character. The young captain could not ask the sergeant to betray his duty to report the infraction, no matter how small. Instead, the captain simply said, “Let’s go see the colonel.” That captain had wanted to be a Marine officer all of his life. It was the only career he ever wanted. When he reported the incident to the colonel, he knew he was jeopardizing his life’s dream. But he did it. The results went by the book. The amphibious squadron stood down. Military couriers flew in from NATO. The codes were changed all over Europe. The battalion was a day late in leaving the Mediterranean. The captain, Leonard F. Chapman III, received a letter of reprimand, damaging his career . He stayed in the corps and died in a tragic accident aboard another ship. I saw some heroic acts in combat in Vietnam, things that made me proud to be an American and a Marine. But that young captain stood for what makes our corps and our country great. Jennings then concluded that Hillary Clinton’s lack of accountability and responsibility in her use of a private email server proved that she was “the antithesis” of that young captain and a secretary without honor. Leonard F. Chapman III died in a scuba diving accident in 1979. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery . His headstone lists his rank as “Major.” ","Politics"

Mike Pence once said that allowing rape victims to get abortions would lead to women trying to get raped. "," This comment about rape victims and abortion didn’t come from Mike Pence. It came from a fake news website called Newslo in a story that appeared under the headline, “Mike Pence: Allowing Rape Victims to Have Abortions Will Lead to Women Trying to Get Raped.” The story reports : The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all. Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime.

"NYPD Detective Mike Greene on Connections Between Clintons, Loretta Lynch, James Comey-Truth! & Disputed!","2016-07-18 11:58:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nypd-detective-mike-greene-connections-clintons-loretta-lynch-james-comey/"," Former NYPD Detective Mike Greene has investigated and written about the connections between U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. "," Many of the claims that former NYPD Detective Mike Greene makes about connections between Loretta Lynch, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and James Comey are true. But, taken together, these claims don’t necessarily prove that there was a conspiracy between all of those people to help Hillary Clinton operate a private email server or to clear her of any charges related to it. It could be argued that many of these connections are the result of these people working in the same professional circles for more than 20 years rather than a master plan of some kind. That’s why we’re also calling this one “disputed.” After Comey announced that the FBI would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, Mike Greene wrote that he had investigated the case himself and had concluded: At the end of the day, how do we have Lynch, previously appointed by Bill Clinton, and formerly an employee of the law firm that is connected to Hillarys email scandal, in charge of the investigation into Hillarys email scandal, with the lead investigative agency led by a man who twice investigated the Clintons and both times found them not guilty of wrong doing, also appointed by the current U.S. President, who appointed Lynch, who is Comeys boss?????? And Comey and Lynch have known each other for decades as well. How was this investigation to have ever been legitimate???? We’ll take a look at each of those claims individually to let you form your own opinions: Bill Clinton Appointed Lynch U.S. Attorney in 1999- Truth! It’s true that Bill Clinton appointed Loretta Lynch to serve as a U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn in 1999, and that she held the post until President George W. Bush asked her to resign in 2001, the New York Times reported in 2001: Ms. Lynch and two of her counterparts upstate — all appointed by President Bill Clinton — are leaving at President Bush’s request. But Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has been asked by the Bush administration to stay on while she investigates Mr. Clinton’s last-minute pardons. Ms. Lynch said: ”I recommended Alan Vinegrad to be the interim, and I’m very, very pleased the attorney general followed that recommendation. Alan is very talented and has a background in a wide variety of cases, and an excellent relationship with the law enforcement agencies we work with. It’s very good for the office, and very good for him.” At the time, Lynch said she was unsure what her next step would be but said she would likely return to private practice. Lynch Joins Law Firm in 2002, Firm Later Represented Company that Set up Hillary’s Email Servers- Truth! & Misleading! It’s true that Loretta Lynch joined Hogan & Hartson LLP in 2002 (which later became Hogan Lovells) as a partner in the firm’s New York Office. It’s also true that Hogan & Hartson represented MX Logic, a company specializing in email defense solutions that was later tied to Hillary Clinton’s personal email server, in its bid to secure a patent for an email spam filtering algorithm in 2004 (U.S. patent 7,051,077 was eventually granted in July 2006). However, MX Logic, which was acquired by McAfee in 2009 , didn’t set up Hillary Clinton’s personal email and server system while she was secretary of state. The company reportedly took over and “reconfigured” her email system in 2013, after her term as secretary of state, Yahoo Finance reports : In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton’s private email account was reconfigured to use Google’s servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google’s accusations in June 2011 that China’s government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking. Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton’s private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic , which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company. So, many of the details of Mike Greene’s findings are true. But it’s not clear what, if anything, the 2004 patent case has to do with MX Logic working on Clinton’s email system nearly 10 years later, in 2013. After all, McAfee was one of the world’s leading email security providers, so it wouldn’t be surprising for the Clintons (or anyone else) to choose the company for email security solutions based on its reputation alone. FBI Director James Comey Investigated Clintons in 1999, 2002 and Found No Wrong Doing- Truth! & Fiction! It’s true that FBI Director James Comey is no stranger to investigating the Clintons — but the idea that he found them guilty of no wrong doing in all cases is false. Back in 1996, Comey served on the Senate Whitewater Committee, which investigated and reported on the Clintons’ investments in the Whitewater Development Corporation. The Senate Whitewater Committee’s final report , which listed Comey as deputy special counsel, found that Hillary Clinton had personally mishandled documents and had told others to block investigators building a case. The report concluded that the Clintons’ interference and destruction of documents amounted to “far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naïveté,” and that it represented “a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.” And, as Greene argues, after President Bush appointed James Comey U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, he was tasked with investigating Bill Clinton’s last-minute presidential pardons in 2002, Time reports : Comey parlayed the Whitewater job into top posts in Virginia and New York, returning to Manhattan in 2002 to be the top federal prosecutor there. One of his first cases as a line attorney in the same office 15 years earlier had been the successful prosecution of Marc Rich, a wealthy international financier, for tax evasion. But on his last day as President in 2001, Bill Clinton pardoned Rich. “I was stunned,” Comey later told Congress. As top U.S. prosecutor in New York in 2002, appointed by George W. Bush, Comey inherited the criminal probe into the Rich pardon and 175 others Clinton had made at the 11th hour. Despite evidence that several pardon recipients, including Rich, had connections to donations to Bill Clinton’s presidential library and Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate campaign, Comey found no criminal wrongdoing. He was careful not to let the investigation be used for political purposes by either party. When pressed for details in one case, he said, “I can’t really go into it because it was an investigation that didn’t result in charges. That may be a frustrating answer, but that’s the one I’m compelled to give.” So, it’s true that James Comey previously investigated the Clintons twice, but Greene’s argument that he cleared them of wrong doing both times isn’t necessarily true. The committee that Comey worked on skewered the Clintons for alleged misconduct, and it was special attorney Kenneth Starr — not Comey or the committee — cleared the Clintons in 1998. Click here for a complete timeline . Overall, the connections that Greene draws between Lynch, Comey, the Clintons, MX Logic and Lynch’s former law firm are true. However, those connections don’t necessarily prove there was any kind of conspiracy between them. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and disputed. ","Politics"

But reports that Rich was on his way to testify about Hillary Clinton, or that his “assassination” has led to the FBI capturing a Clinton “hit team” are false. WUSA 9 in Washington reported that Rich was shot and killed in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Northwest D.C. in what appeared to be a robbery gone wrong: The shooting happened in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW on Sunday at 4:19 a.m., Metropolitan Police said. Police arrived at the scene and found Conrad conscious and breathing. He was suffering from gunshot wounds. Conrad was taken to the hospital where he later died from his injuries. “A lot of my girlfriends around here are talking about this and looking out for one another. We don’t want anyone walking by themselves,” neighbor Katie Ferguson said. “It’s scary. I want something done and so far there is a lot of talk, but what’s really being done?” Officials said they are looking into the possibility that Rich’s murder is connected to other recent robberies in the area. The sad story of Seth Rich’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them. What Does It Mean quickly spread the Russian propaganda in the U.S. with a story appearing under the headline, “Assassination of Top U.S. Democratic Party Official Leads to FBI Capture of Clinton Team,” that reports : A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City. Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place. There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights. While robbery has been cited as a motive in Rich’s death, it’s still not clear why he was murdered. His parents told the Inquisitor that if it was an attempted robbery, his attacker had failed since Rich still had cash on him when he was found So, while it’s not clear why Rich was murdered, reports that he was assassinated by a Clinton hit team that came from Russian propaganda should be considered fiction.

The column, which appeared at Town Hall on July 10th, tells of Donald Trump’s good deeds over the last three decades that “have gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears.” It’s meant to defend Trump against claims that he’s “a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe, Semitic and Islamaphobe.” Conklin makes a number of specific claims about Trump’s good deeds, and they mostly check out. But the idea that Trump didn’t get any attention or press coverage or credit for them is false since we found endless media reports about almost all of them. Trump Prevented Foreclosure of Annabel Hill’s Family Farm in 1986- Truth! Annabel Hill’s husband, Lenard, killed himself in 1986, 20 minutes before his family farm in Georgia was to be sold in a bank auction. He had hoped to use life insurance money to pay debts, which exceeded $300,000, but it only covered $175,000. That’s when Atlanta businessman Frank Argenbright, Jr., who had helped another area farmer save his land, organized a news conference for Annabel Hill in Atlanta to plead for public help, and Donald Trump stepped in when he saw coverage of the press conference on NBC Nightly News. Trump wrote in his book, “The Art of the Deal,” that he phoned a vice president of the bank the next morning and threatened to sue the bank for murder against the bank if they didn’t bring a halt to the auction.

Donald Trump sent his Boeing 727 to Los Angeles to retrieve Andrew Ten, a 3-year-old Orthodox Jewish child who was sick with a “rare and still undiagnosed” breathing illness in 1988. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports that Trump stepped in after the boy was not allowed on commercial airlines because of his needed medical equipment: Trump made his plane available for the special trip to New York after the boy’s parents, Judy and Harold Ten, called Trump and told him of their plight. Commercial airlines refused to fly the child because he could not travel without an elaborate life-support system, which includes a portable oxygen tank, a suction machine, a breathing bag and an adrenaline syringe. “Mr. Trump did not hesitate when we called him up. He said ‘yes, I’ll send my plane out,’” 29-year-old Harold Ten recalled shortly after he landed here Tuesday morning. Asked why he thought Trump made his private jet available, Ten replied, “Because he is a good man. He has three children of his own and he knows what being a parent is all about.” Ten said he believes that Trump fulfilled the Talmudic saying that “he who saves one person’s life is as if he saved the entire world.” Among the relatives at the airport to greet the child and his parents were the paternal grandparents of the sick boy. “Donald Trump is a miracle, just a miracle,” said grandmother Feigy Ten, who came to the airport with her husband, Phillip Ten. Trump Flew Operation Desert Storm Troops from North Carolina to Miami- Truth! After a logistics error prevented 200 Marines who had recently returned from Operation Desert Storm in 1991 from flying from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to see their families in North Carolina, Donald Trump stepped in, The Sean Hannity Show reports : Today, Stickney would like to say “thank you.” Stickney (left), was a squad leader in a TOW company of a Marine reserve unit based in Miami, FL and spent approximately six months in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War between 1990 and 1991. Upon his unit’s return to the United States, the former Marine says the group spent several weeks decompressing at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading back to Miami. Stickney recalls being told that a mistake had been made within the logistics unit and that an aircraft wasn’t available to take the Marines home on their scheduled departure date. This—according to Stickney—is where Donald Trump comes in. “The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And that’s all we knew….I remember asking ‘Who is Donald Trump?’ I truly didn’t know anything about him,” the former Marine said. The story also includes a photo of the 200 Marines boarding Trump’s plane. Trump Paid Off a Good Samaritan’s Mortgage- Truth! After a man stopped to help repair a flat tire on Donald Trump’s limo in 1995, Trump asked the man how he could repay him. The man said Trump should send flowers to his wife. A while later, the flowers arrived, along with a note from Trump, Forbes magazine reported : Some time later, the flowers arrived — with a card attached. The card, according to Forbes magazine, said, “We paid off your home mortgage, Marla and Donald.” Trump Helped a Little Girl With Brittle Bone Disease in 2000-Truth! After a little girl with brittle bone disease appeared on “The Maury Povich Show” in 2000, Trump appeared on a follow up show to deliver a message to her: I was watching Maury’s show the other day, and you hit me right here. I think you are so beautiful both inside and out. I have a little something, a little gift that I gave to Maury … and I hope that you and your mother have a good time with it. You are very special. Povich then presented the little girl and her mother with a check from Trump and said, “We’re not talking about chump change here.” Trump Hosted Jennifer Hudson in His Windy City Hotel After Her Family Was Murdered- Truth!

"Guccifer, Hacker Tied to Hillary Clinton Email Scandal, Missing or Dead-Fiction!","2016-07-07 09:45:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/guccifer-hacker-tied-hillary-clinton-email-scandal-goes-missing/"," Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar (aka Guccifer), who is famous for claiming that he hacked Hillary Clinton’s private email server, went missing or was found dead in his jail cell. "," Claims that Marcel Lehel Lazar, or “Guccifer,” went missing just before the FBI interviewed Hillary Clinton about her use of a private email server don’t check out. Guccifer has been held in an Alexandria, Virginia, jail cell since pleading guilty to hacking charges in May. In a short statemen t released on July 6, the Alexandria Sheriff’s Department shot down rumors that Guccifer was missing or had been found dead in his cell: Marcel Lehel Lazar, a federal inmate also known as Guccifer, is at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria, Va. He is alive and has never been missing from this facility. Guccifer pleaded guilty to charges of identity theft and unauthorized access to protected computers for breaking into the email and social media accounts of approximately 100 Americans, including former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, as well as former Secretary of State Colin Powell. When it comes to Hillary Clinton, Guccifer claimed that he had successfully hacked into her private email server, but he didn’t provide any documents or proof to back up that claim. He did, however, hack into the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, a former advisor to Clinton, NBC News reports : He also obtained e-mails from Sidney Blumenthal, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton. Their disclosure online revealed that she had a private e-mail address, when eventually led the FBI to investigate whether classified information was mishandled. Lazar claimed he succeeded in hacking into her private e-mail server and downloading some of the contents. “It was like an open orchid on the Internet. There were hundreds of folders,” he told NBC News correspondent Cynthia McFadden before he was extradited to the U.S. But Lazar refused to show any of the material he said he found on the Clinton server, and federal investigators said they have found no evidence to back up his claim. Rumors that Guccifer had been found dead or had gone missing, and that it was somehow related to Hillary Clinton’s private email server case, started to spread after the FBI interviewed Clinton on July 2. The rumor didn’t stop after FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau wouldn’t recommend criminal charges against Clinton on July 5. The website What Does It Mean reported that Guccifer had gone missing from jail and that his whereabouts were unknown on July 2, the day the FBI interviewed Clinton: According to this report, Guccifer is at the center of what is turning into one of America’s greatest political scandals for his hacking into the private email server of former Secretary of State (and current US presidential candidate) Hillary Clinton that, in turn, allowed the SVR to gain access to them too—and which recently an unnamed US State Department official admitted to the Washington Times both China and Israel now have possession of too. Then, on July 5, the Christian Times Newspaper (not to be confused with the reputable Christian Times ) picked up the hoax about Guccifer with a story appearing under the headline, “Romanian Hacker with Access to Clinton Emails Found Dead in Jail Cell.” Given the website’s resemblance to the reputable Christian Times publication, many people were duped into believing that the Christian Times Newspaper story was true. However, the website has become know for publishing false “click bait” articles, and this appears to be another one of them. Reports that Guccifer has been found dead or has gone missing are false, and claims that Guccifer is “at the center” of the Clinton email server scandal are unproven since his claims haven’t been verified by investigators. This rumor fits into a larger narrative that has been advanced about Clinton foes being found dead or going missing under suspicious circumstances. See our “Clinton Body Count” story here for a list of claims about that. Another investigation into rumors that John Ashe, a former United Nations General Assembly president, was found dead days before he was set to testify Clinton, can be read here . ","Politics"
"John Ashe Dies Days Before Testifying Against Hillary Clinton Donor – Truth! & Fiction!","2016-06-27 10:17:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/john-ashe-dies-days-before-testifying-against-hillary-clinton-donor/"," John Ashe, a former diplomat and president of the United Nations General Assembly from Antigua, died in June 2016, days before he was to testify in a corruption case against a Hillary Clinton donor. "," It’s true that John Ashe died unexpectedly in the middle of a corruption case, and that an alleged former Clinton donor was involved, but other details about Ashe and the charges against him are false or unproven. First, neither Hillary Clinton nor the Clinton Foundation were involved in the corruption case against John Ashe. Second, the so-called donor that Ashe was allegedly set to testify against, Ng Lap Seng, hasn’t had traceable ties to the Clintons since the mid 199os. Third, there’s no proof that Ashe died just before he was scheduled to testify against the so-called Clinton donor. John Ashe, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly, was indicted in a bribery scheme in October 2015 for allegedly accepting more than $1 million from people in China for real estate deals, according to a criminal complaint . The complaint alleges that John Ashe took illegal payments from Ng Lap Seng, a Chinese real estate developer from Macau, and used his “official position to obtain for NG potentially lucrative investments in Antigua.” Again, the Clintons were not involved in the case. The 61-year-old John Ashe was charged with engaging in a pattern of corruption with six others that netted more than $1 million in bribes from Seng. Ashe allegedly used the illegal payments to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, including $59,000 in hand-tailored suits from Hong Kong, multiple $54,000 Rolex watches and $69,000 golf club membership. John Ashe’s family released a statement that said he had collapsed several times at his home in Dobbs Ferry, Westchester, New York, before his death on June 22. Ashe had been under the care of a neurologist and had been awaiting the results of an MRI at the time of this death, the family said : Ambassador Ashe and his family had been dealing with an inordinate level of stress over the past eight months, relating to the unproven allegations leveled against him and the home detention imposed on him by court proceedings. Sadly, now his legal efforts to clear his name have been tragically cut short. Ambassador Ashe’s wife was devastated to find him collapsed at home on June 22, 2016. His wife and younger son had previously found him collapsed and unresponsive first on April 25th, and again on April 28th. Both times, he was taken by ambulance to the hospital and received emergency medical treatment. On June 22nd, it appears that a third episode of collapse, tragically, led to his untimely death. At the time of his passing, he was under the care of a neurologist who was evaluating the cause of the earlier episodes. He was awaiting the results of an MRI, and was scheduled for an Electroencephalogram (EEG) for sleep deprivation on June 25th. Following John Ashe’s death, claims that he was scheduled to testify against Hillary Clinton or Ng Lap Seng quickly went viral — but they don’t check out. Prosecutors in the case have said that he was scheduled for pre-trial activity, but the trial was not set to begin days after his death, and he was not scheduled to testify against Seng at the time of his death. As for Ng Lap Seng, who was arrested in September for allegedly lying about why he brought $4.5 million in cash into the country, it’s true that a 1998 Senate committee report tied him to the Democratic Party’s fund raising efforts — and to Bill Clinton in particular. The report states that Seng laundered money through a Little Rock restaurateur who donated thousands to the Democratic Party: Former Little Rock, Arkansas, restaurateur Yah Lin “Charlie” Trie and Macau-based businessman Ng Lap Seng collaborated in a scheme to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign funds to the DNC. Ng wired over one million dollars from accounts he maintains in Macau and Hong Kong to accounts maintained by or accessible to Trie in Little Rock and Washington, D.C. Although Trie held himself out as an international trader (and, in fact, actively sought to develop an international trading business he called Daihatsu International Trading Corporation), he was never successful. Trie’s bank records and tax returns reveal that he received little or no income from sources other than Ng Lap Seng. Although he failed to establish a successful, income-generating international trading business, Trie, his wife and his businesses managed to contribute a total of $220,000 to the DNC between 1994 and 1996. Trie and Ng also reimbursed the contributions made by a number of other DNC contributors who were recruited by Trie in order to further disguise the ultimate source of the contributions. As Trie earned little money through his own business activities, the Committee concludes that Trie used the foreign-source funds wired from Ng to make his (and his wife’s and businesses’) DNC contributions and to reimburse the conduit contributors. The Justice Department indicted Trie for these illegal activities on January 28, 1998. Bill Clinton was named as “among the politicians who frequented Fu Lin and became friends with Trie” while he was the governor of Arkansas. The report concluded that, “Trie’s contributions purchased access for himself and Ng to the highest levels of our government.” ABC News also reported in 1997 that Seng had made six trips to the White House and frequented events sponsored by the Democratic National Committee. Here’s a photo of one of those visits: So, in conclusion, claims that John Ashe died days before he was scheduled to testify against Clinton donor Ng Lap Seng are both true and false. Ashe died unexpectedly during pre-trial activity, but there’s no indication that he was killed. There’s also no indication that he was scheduled to testify against Seng.

"Marco Rubio: Orlando Shooting God’s Sign I’m Needed in Senate-Fiction!","2016-06-24 09:05:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marco-rubio-orlando-shooting-sign-im-needed-senate/"," Florida Senator Marco Rubio said that the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that left 50 people dead was a signal from God that “He needs me back in the Senate.” "," This fake Marco Rubio quote came from a fake news website. A story published by Newslo on June 14th under the headline, “Rubio: ‘God Killed Those Gays in Orlando to Signal He Needs Me Back in the Senate,” begins: The terrorist attack at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub has “impacted” the thinking of Marco Rubio “about a lot of things,” the Florida senator said Monday, including making him “think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.” During an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Monday morning, the conservative radio host urged the former Republican presidential candidate to change his mind and seek re-election for his Senate seat. “This is indeed a time to reflect,” Rubio told Hewitt. “This is a time to reflect on our past, on what we have done to cause this tragedy, how to remedy it for the sake of the future, and most importantly, how to address the consequences of this terrible attack. Because, despite of what we might think, we have a lot to do with this, every single one of us. Especially the Democrats.” The story was quickly shared more than 33,000 times on Facebook, and many readers were duped into believing that it was true. One person commented on the story: OMG…I seriously considered as a possible candidate, but now he’s said all these stupid things, I would never ever vote for him. Are all politicians IDIOTS?? However, Newslo is a hybrid news-satire website that lets readers toggle between tidbits of fact and fiction in its story. Rubio’s quote that the Orlando nightclub massacre was a sign from God that he should return to the Senate was fiction. The truthful part was an exchange between Rubio and radio host Hugh Hewitt in which Rubio said that tragedies like the Orlando shooting make one rethink service to their country and how they can be most useful.

"Donald Trump Called Canadians “Snow Mexicans”-Fiction!","2016-06-22 14:52:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-called-canadians-snow-mexicans/"," A tweet in which Donald Trump allegedly called Canadians “snow Mexicans” has gone viral. "," Donald Trump didn’t call Canadians snow Mexicans. That rumor started with an image on the photo-sharing website imgur that appeared to show a tweet from Donald Trump that said, “I wish someone would call Canadians what they are: Snow Mexicans.” The first giveaway that the tweet isn’t authentic is that the font is different than Twitter’s standard type, which means someone removed the original text and added the comment about snow Mexicans over the top. And the person who did that used this tweet (the time and date stamp are identical) as a template: The story got a second wind on June 19th after the website Liberal Darkness published a false report based on the tweet under the headline, “Trump Calls Canadians ‘Snow Mexicans.’ Vows to Build Wall to Keep Them ‘In Canada Where They Belong” that begins: Angered by Canada’s refusal to seal their border off to ‘foreign radicals’, a fiery Donald Trump today lambasted Canada and vowed to ensure that the ‘snow Mexicans’ and anyone else in Canada would not be able to invade the United States during his watch. During a highly covered speech in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump energized his voter base and vowed to implement policies that will make America great again.

"Dolly Kyle Makes Claims in “Hillary the Other Woman” Book-Disputed!","2016-06-13 10:12:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dolly-kyle-makes-claims-hillary-woman-book/"," Dolly Kyle makes accusations about Hillary Clinton in her book, “Hillary the Other Woman.” "," Dolly Kyle has been making accusations about having affairs with Bill Clinton and about Hillary Clinton for decades — but these claims haven’t been definitively proven true or false. Dolly Kyle is a former classmate of Bill Clinton’s and has long claimed she had an on-and-off affair with him through the early 1990s. In her latest book, “Hillary the Other Woman,” Kyle makes the case that Bill and Hillary’s relationship was solely for political gain and explains how Hillary was able to silence her. First, in order to provide some background,  it’s important to take a step back to look at Dolly Kyle’s public exchanges with the Clintons over the years. These allegations aren’t new — she’s been making them for decades. In 1998, Dolly Kyle Browning filed a lawsuit that alleged the Clintons and their people had tried to prevent her from publishing a book that was “loosely based” on her relationship with Bill. A federal judge in the case ruled that “the case was so flawed there was no need to proceed with depositions or a trial,” ABC News reported : Browning says she went to high school with Bill Clinton and his brother Roger in Hot Springs, Ark. in the 1960s. She alleged she became friends with the future president and carried on an extramarital sexual affair with him from the mid-1970s until roughly 1991. Her lawsuit centers on handwritten notes President Clinton made about a 1994 conversation the two had in Arkansas at their 30th high school reunion. At a 1998 deposition in the Paula Jones case, Clinton said he wrote out the three pages in order to protect himself against untrue claims Browning was making about an affair. “She basically said she didn’t want me to be her friend and she was mad at me because I’d never been her lover,” Clinton said at the deposition. Browning alleged the notes falsely denied their relationship. But the judge said Clinton was protected by the fact that the notes were only made public as a result of their being filed in the Jones lawsuit. Bryant ruled that Clinton’s production of the notes in that context was “absolutely privileged” and could not be held against him. In a transcript of Dolly Kyle’s deposition in the Paula Jones case, she said her relationship with Bill “ended abruptly” when he stopped returning her calls in 1992. She added that Clinton’s people threatened to destroy her if she went public with the accusations, but that Bill later apologized in a meeting at their high school reunion in 1994. She also challenged the idea that Clinton wrote up notes to protect himself against her false allegations: Our conversation began with my confronting him for not returning my call in early 1992. This lead to a discussion of many things, including his affair with Gennifer Flowers. I reminded him that he had threatened to destroy me and he said he was sorry. We discussed many other things. At the end of the conversation he asked me to come to Washington. He said “You can live on the hill. I can help you find a job.” I have reviewed the notes attached to this declaration as Exhibit A. I can state unequivocally that those notes are not an accurate account of the conversation or of the entire evening. The notes attributed to Marsha Scott are false. She did not stand by Billy Clinton during my conversation with him. Neither she nor anyone other than possibly the two male Secret Service Agents were in a position to hear our conversation. At no time during the conversation did I say that any statement I had made to him or about our relationship was false. Dolly Kyle then took aim at Hillary Clinton in Edward Klein’s “The Truth About Hillary” book. Hillary’s people have called “blatant and vicious fabrications contrived by someone who writes trash for cash.” Slate recounts Dolly Kyle Browning statements about Hillary: Pages 91-92: Dolly Kyle Browning, who says she was Bill Clinton’s longtime mistress, tells Klein that Bill asked her to pray for Hillary to get pregnant. “He and Hillary never had much of a sexual relationship,” she explains. “Also, Billy had a low sperm count, and he and Hillary were going to a fertility specialist in California. They had been trying for quite a while without any success.” Page 84: Dolly Kyle Browning on Hillary when she arrived in Arkansas to help with the 1974 Congressional race: “You should have seen her! No, you should have smelled her.” In the lead up to the release of her book, Dolly Kyle said “Hillary Clinton’s nomination shames women” and that Hillary was a borderline sociopath in an interview with WND . So, Dolly Kyle has been making accusations about Bill and Hillary Clinton for decades, but they’re impossible to fact check because they’re all based on personal conversations or exchanges that can’t be independently verified. The Clintons have disputed Kyle’s claims — and she’s disputed theirs. ","Politics"
"Chelsea Clinton Makes $900,000 for Doing Almost Nothing-Mostly Fiction!","2016-06-10 10:05:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/chelsea-clinton-makes-900000-almost-nothing/"," A forwarded email about Chelsea Clinton making a total of $900,000 for doing almost nothing warns about America turning into an oligarchy. "," Claims about Chelsea Clinton making $900,000 for doing nothing are mostly false because they’re based on outdated and false information. Those rumors began circulating in June 2014 after Politico reported that Chelsea Clinton was paid $600,000 a year for a part-time stint as “special correspondent” for NBC News from 2011-2014. In order to arrive at the “$900,000 for doing almost nothing” conclusion, the rumors claim that Chelsea Clinton earns $300,000 per year for her role at the Clinton Foundation. However, we have found that claim to be false (more on that later). We’ll start out by looking at claims related to Chelsea Clinton’s work at NBC News. The initial Politico story that broke details of Chelsea’s dealings with NBC reports : Chelsea Clinton earned an annual salary of $600,000 at NBC News before switching to a month-to-month contract earlier this year, sources with knowledge of the agreement told Politico . Clinton, who joined NBC News as a special correspondent in November 2011, was up for renewal or nonrenewal this year. Instead, the sources said, the network decided to keep her on the payroll on a month-to-month basis so the two parties could sever ties if Clinton’s mother, Hillary Clinton, runs for president. New York Magazine picked up the story from there, adding that Chelsea Clinton collected that hefty paycheck “to do nothing, basically” at NBC News: Former first child (now with child) Chelsea Clinton had a $600,000 annual contract at NBC News, Politico reports, where she served as a “special correspondent” and was deemed to be mostly useless, if not “one of the most boring people of her era.” That deal is over now, but Clinton is still being paid by the network (which has also hired Luke Russert, Meghan McCain, and Jenna Bush … ) on a month-to-month basis, with complicating factors including her pregnancy and the good odds her mother is running for president. “NBC News continues to enjoy a wonderful working relationship with Chelsea, and we are proud of her work,” said a spokesperson. In September 2015, Vanity Fair cited sources within NBC News who called Chelsea Clinton’s stint there “a disaster” and said that news of her sizeable salary for a part-time job had caused ripples in the organization: Her stint at NBC was a disaster, perhaps because it ran so contrary to her instincts. “Most of us were baffled [by the hire], because she never even spoke to the press,” says an NBC veteran. “She’d walk by with the imperial stare, looking forward, and interacted not at all.” The feeling inside NBC was that she had been hired to maintain access to and curry favor with the Clintons. When news broke that she had been getting paid $600,000—for a part-time job—NBC staffers were appalled. Most full-time correspondents were being paid far less. The big salary was predicated on the idea that she was already a star, and according to an insider, she started acting like one. Colleagues felt they couldn’t communicate with her directly. Instead, they had to go through her people. And she was hardly present in the office. “There was a joke inside the building that she was the ‘highest-paid ghost’ at NBC,” says a network source. It all might have been excused had she been any good. In the span of nearly three years, however, she filed only a handful of segments—all painfully stiff reports on global do-gooders, plus an attempted comic interview with the Geico Gecko. As the insider puts it, “NBC has made a lot of bad decisions in the last few years, but hiring Chelsea has to be very near the top.” So, it’s true that Chelsea Clinton was paid $600,000 a year for a limited, part-time role at NBC News from 2011-2014 — but she’s no longer employed there. That makes that portion of the rumor outdated. And claims about Chelsea’s Clinton’s salary at the Clinton Foundation are just plain fiction. According to tax records filed by the Clinton Foundation, Chelsea earns no reportable compensation for her role there. In conclusion, it’s true that Chelsea Clinton once earned $600,000 a year for her role as special correspondent at NBC News — but that’s not the case anymore. And Chelsea doesn’t earn $300,000 a year working at the Clinton Foundation, according to tax records. That’s why we’re calling this one “mostly fiction.” ","Politics"

Controversy over Hillary’s wardrobe spread across social media in June after the New York Post published a report on her “designer wardrobe.” The report opened talking about a primary victory speech that Hillary delivered in April wearing the now infamous Armani jacket: Hillary Clinton’s New York primary victory speech in April focused on topics including income inequality, job creation and helping people secure their retirement. It was a clear attempt to position herself as an everywoman. But an everywoman she is not — she gave the speech in a $12,495 Giorgio Armani tweed jacket. Hillary Clinton wore the Armani jacket during a speech she delivered after winning the New York primary on April 20th. And it’s true that she touched on the impact of the Great Recession and income inequality in her speech, according to a transcript: …America is a problem-solving nation. And in this campaign, we are setting bold progressive goals backed up by real plans that will improve lives, creating more good jobs that provide dignity and pride in a middle class life, raising wages and reducing inequality , making sure all our kids get a good education no matter what zip code they live in, building ladders of opportunity and empowerment so all of our people can go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. But did the jacket actually cost $12,000? That’s where claims about Hillary’s designer wardrobe get a little fuzzy. First, the “Coat in Napa Lambskin” that Hillary wore was “marked down” on the Giorgio Armani website in June from $12,495 to $7,497. It’s not clear how much the jacket cost when Hillary wore it in April. It’s also not clear if Hillary was given the coat at an even deeper discount. In short, there’s no way of knowing how much (or if) Hillary paid for it. Still, regardless of whether the jacket cost $7,000 or $12,000, the irony of the situation rings true: Hillary wore a very expensive jacket while giving a speech in which she empathized with people who are “hurting” financially and referenced income inequality. But this isn’t the first time a political figure’s designer wardrobe has grabbed headlines. Sarah Palin and Michelle Obama have both been criticized for their expensive taste in clothes on the campaign trail in the past. The wardrobe of female political figures has been a hot topic of conversation for years. New York Daily News reports that Mary Todd Lincoln “racked up tens of thousands of dollars in clothing bills and considered selling manure from White House grounds to pay them off.” Laura Bush, meanwhile, wrote that she was “amazed by the sheer number of designer clothes that I was expected to buy” as first lady. And some people (correctly) point out that it always seems to be female political figures’ wardrobes that draw fire, even though men can rack up hefty bills, too. Donald Trump, for example, reportedly wears $7,000 Italian suites. That price doesn’t include ties, undershirts and shoes, either. But in the end, we’re calling this one “mostly truth” because Hillary wore an Armani jacket valued at $7,000-$12,000 during a speech in which she referenced income inequality. ","Politics"
"Photo Shows Hillary Clinton’s Incontinence-Fiction!","2016-06-08 13:41:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/photo-shows-hillary-clintons-incontinence-fiction/"," A photo of Bill and Hillary Clinton boarding a plane supposedly proves that she is incontinent. "," Photo editing software was used to make it appear that Hillary Clinton had a bathroom mishap in this photo. The altered version of the photo began making the rounds on social media and in discussion boards in May 2016, and it had gained momentum by the time Hillary clinched the Democratic presidential nomination. One explanation that appeared with the photo seems to “dance around” the issue by implying that it was an “unfortunate bodily function”: This photo appears to show Hillary Clinton, wife of former President Bill Clinton, in a slightly soiled dress as she boards Air Force One. Although it is difficult to determine what the curious spot on her dress is, it is in a location that would indicate either a stain or an unfortunate bodily function has occurred. The photo cannot be verified for the date it was taken, nor the location, but from the rear it appears she is most definitely with her husband Bill. However, the photo was taken by Getty Images photographer Luke Frazza on January 26, 1995 — and there is no suspicious spot on the back of the first lady’s dress in the actual photo, which can be viewed here .

"Home Depot’s Founder and CEO Bernie Marcus Endorses Donald Trump-Truth! & Outdated!","2016-06-08 13:29:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/home-depots-founder-ceo-bernie-marcus-endorses-donald-trump/"," Home Depot founder, CEO and chairman Bernie Marcus endorsed Donald Trump in an essay published online. "," Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus had endorsed Donald Trump— but he is no longer CEO and chairman of the home improvement chain. Bernie Marcus threw his support behind Donald Trump in an editorial published by Real Clear Politics on June 1 under the headline, “Why I Stand with Donald Trump.” In his endorsement of Turmp, Marcus wrote: As a backer of former Republican presidential candidates, I now stand in support of Donald J. Trump because the fate of this nation depends upon sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House. I know Donald Trump, but we’re not close friends. However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn. Like many, I am deeply concerned about the US Supreme Court. When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped. Marcus, who co-founded Home Depot in 1978, added that if he were to try to found the home improvement chain today, he would likely fail because of government regulations. As word of Bernie Marcus’s endorsement of Trump spread across social media, a grassroots effort to boycott Home Depot sprang up among Trump’s critics. Viral posts that listed Marcus as the founder, CEO and chairman of the board for Home Depot were only partially correct, however. Bernie Marcus co-founded Home Depot in 1978, but he retired in 2001 to focus on philanthropy, Forbes reports . So, it’s true that Bernie Marcus has endorsed Donald Trump — but it’s not true that Marcus is the current CEO and chairman of Home Depot. ","Politics"
"Trump Protestor Admits He Was Paid to Protest Donald Trump-Fiction!","2016-06-07 13:59:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trump-protestor-admits-paid-protest-donald-trump/"," A man who protested a Donald Trump rally has admitted that he was paid $3,500 to do so after answering a Craig’s List ad. "," A fake news website is behind reports that a Donald Trump protestor has admitted that he was paid to disrupt a Trump campaign event in Arizona. The story originated with a report that appeared at fake news site designed to look like ABC News to deceive readers. The story, which appeared under the headline, “Donald Trump Protestor Speaks Out: ‘Why I Was Paid $3,500 to Protest Trump’s Rally” reports: PHOENIX A.Z. (AP) — For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event. “I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 37-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.” Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders’ campaign, but Horner disagrees. “As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.” The report included a screen grab of the supposed Craig’s List ad for paid Trump protestors, too. Hundreds of readers who were duped into believing the report was true commented on the story, and it was widely circulated on social media. However, the site isn’t a trusted news source — it’s only designed to resemble one. The site’s URL is close to that of ABC News, only the imposter has “.co” added to the end. ","Politics"
"Claims About Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Ties to For-Profit Laureate University-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-06-07 10:47:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-bill-hillary-clintons-ties-profit-laureate-university/"," Rumors are circulating about Bill and Hillary Clinton’s ties to Laureate International University, one of the largest for-profit higher ed institutions in the world. "," Bill Clinton was paid millions while serving as the honorary chancellor of Laureate International University over five years — but claims that Hillary Clinton funneled millions in government grants to a related non-profit during that time are misleading. The extent of Bill Clinton’s ties to the for-profit university chain emerged in July 2015, shortly after his five-year stint as honorary chancellor of Laureate came to end. Tax returns released by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign disclosed that Bill Clinton had been paid about $16.5 million from 2010-2015 for serving as honorary chancellor of the for-profit higher ed chain. Additionally, Laureate CEO Douglas Becker donated $4,600 to Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign and $2,000 to her 2000 Senate campaign. Laureate was also a founding donor of the 100,000 Strong Foundation, a non-profit started by Hillary before she left the State Department to expand the study of Mandarin in the United States, Bloomberg Business reports . Supporters of Donald Trump have pointed to the Clintons’ ties to Laureate University to deflect public outcry over allegations that Trump University preyed on and defrauded students who studied there. Peter Schweizer, the conservative author of “Clinton Cash,” has argued that Hillary funneled millions of dollars in grants to Becker’s International Youth Foundation (IYF) while Bill served as the honorary chancellor of Becker’s for-profit college, and that Bill resigned from the post once that became public. A Bloomberg review of IYF’s tax filings show that the organization did pocket millions in grants before and after Bill Clinton was named honorary chancellor: A Bloomberg examination of IYF’s tax filings show that in 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate, the nonprofit received 11 grants worth $9 million from the State Department or the affiliated USAID. In 2010, the group received 14 grants worth $15.1 million. In 2011, 13 grants added up to $14.6 million. The following year, those numbers jumped: IYF received 21 grants worth $25.5 million, including a direct grant from the State Department. However, the Clintons argued that Schweizer had mischaracterized the relationship between them and IYF because the group was initially funded by the Bush administration and that funding actually went down after Hillary became secretary of state: The Clinton campaign disputed Schweizer’s characterization. “This is yet another false allegation in a book that is fast being debunked,” said Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman. “The International Youth Foundation was funded by the Bush administration, well before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. In fact, the group’s USAID funding actually went down in the year that she arrived at the State Department, not up.” A Laureate spokesperson said denied Schweizer’s claims, stating, “The politics and motives of the author are obvious and his claims are baseless.” The facts of this rumor are true, but key details have been left out. Namely, IYF was established by President H.W. Bush and received millions in government grants well before Hillary became secretary of state and Bill became honorary chancellor of Laureate. Given all that, we’re classifying this one as truth and misleading. ","Politics"

Because it’s impossible to definitively prove that a historical quote does not exist, we’re going to report this one as fiction until evidence proving otherwise surfaces. The quote has been making the rounds in memes and on discussion boards for years: To anger a conservative, lie to him. To anger a liberal, tell him the truth. Barry Popik, a contributing editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, investigated the quote and found that it first appeared in print sometime around 2007. Early on, the quote was attributed to an “unknown source.” It was first attributed to Roosevelt in 2009, and by 2010 it was regularly being attributed to him. That progression suggests the quote was a modern invention and Theodore Roosevelt’s name was attached to it nearly 100 years after his death. We also searched archives of Theodore Roosevelt’s letters in the National Archives for any references to the quote — but nothing turned up. Given that no official records linking Theodore Roosevelt to this quote on liberals and conservatives, we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","Politics"
"Obama Declares June LGBT Pride Month-Truth!","2016-06-02 09:55:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-declares-june-lgbt-pride-month/"," President Obama has declared June Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. "," It’s true that President Obama issued a proclamation declaring June 2016 LGBT Pride Month. Obama issued a presidential proclamation on May 31, 2016, that declared June 2016 LGBT Pride month and called on “the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.” The presidential proclamation state, in part: Since our founding, America has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect Union.  This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth.  The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society.  They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment — under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics.  This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice. Last year’s landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines.  For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals. And this wasn’t the first time President Obama has declared June LGBT Pride month, either. The president also declared June 2015 LGBT Pride month through a presidential proclamation issued in May 2015 . ","Politics"

"," President Obama was named the 5th best president by the University of Georgia or by Texas A&M. Those rumors started in March 2014 with a post at Zipper Weasel , a spoof website with the tag line “Scouring the Bowels of the Internet.” The story, which appeared under the headline “Texas A&M Study: Obama The Fifth Best President in History” showed a screen shot of the so-called study that ranked the top five presidents as such 1 Reagan & Lincoln tied for first 2 Seventeen presidents tied for second 3 Twenty-three presidents tied for third 4 Jimmy Carter came in fourth, and… 5 Obama was fifth Considering that Obama was the 44th president of the United States, and that the so-called study lists 43 former presidents as finishing ahead of him, it was obviously a gag meant to imply that Obama was actually the worst president in U.S. history. Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz fanned the flames in 2014 by retweeting the Texas A&M study with the hashtag #AggieJoke — but many of Cruz’s followers simply read the headline and missed the joke: That led a Texas A&M official to go on the record with The Eagle , the university’s student newspaper , to clarify that the so-called study was a hoax: The study is clearly a joke. The click-bait headline combines Texas A&M + Obama + “best president,” but when you read through the “methodology” Obama is actually the worst president. The A&M spokesman said the chain-joke-spam-letter first cropped up in the early fall and that he wasn’t sure why it had just resurfaced. He said the university had not formally distanced themselves from the study because officials didn’t want to help it spread. Not that there was ever any doubt, but Texas A&M University has nothing to do with the chain study about President Barack Obama that’s spreading around. An A&M spokesman said it’s a hoax. The statement attributed to the “Public Relations Office at A&M” is fabricated. The post has caught fire recently and was tweeted out by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz on Thursday afternoon. It’s all over right-wing blogs and the social media accounts of the faithful. As the end of President Obama’s final term in office neared its end in 2016, the hoax study finding that Obama was the 5th best president in history went viral again. In this version, however, the University of Georgia had ranked Obama 5th best. The new version was a variation on the previous hoax. ","Politics"

The commentary was published by blogger Fitz Simmons in early 2013 at his blog site, Politically True . However, Simmons’ name was quickly dropped from the post, and it was circulated without an author named throughout 2013. But, by early 2014, Jeff Foxworthy’s name was quickly added to the piece to give it more credibility given that it borrowed his famous “you might be a redneck” joke setup.

We weren’t able to find any record of Foxworthy actually say that in an interview or in his standup routine.

In 2012, he supported Mitt Romney’s presidential bid and campaigned with him across southern states. That same year he described his Christian beliefs in an appearance on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze .

Free Wood Post published the story under the headline “Anonymous Hacks IRS Database — Publishes Trump’s Tax Records.” The site reported that Anonymous recovered 12 years of Trump’s tax returns and released them to “hundreds of top websites” that published and then removed them within minutes: Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson stated last week that “there has been no year in which Trump paid zero taxes”. In 2012, this was true. He earned $37,746,530, far less that the $400+ million he claims. His final tax burden? Trump didn’t pay $0 in taxes, he actually received a tax refund of $7,832,224. That’s right, he cashed in a 7.8-million dollar tax refund. Recently, Trump stated that “I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.” So, how did Trump “earn” a tax refund? According to his return, he had approximately $37,743,000 in itemized deductions. In addition to massive business write-offs for legal fees relating to his fraudulent Trump “University” and fraudulent real estate transactions, Trump had other more unusual deductions. Trump’s deductions ranged from $118,923 for “Tribble Hair Services” to a $3.8 million dollar write-off for “Anal Bleaching” both listed as an “image expense.” He also made numerous charitable contributions to places like The National Association for the Advancement of White Men and the Trump Fund which provides financial and emotional assistance to wealthy men going through divorce. The Trump family also paid salaries to their numerous employees including, eight chauffeurs, two yacht captains, four pilots for their private jets, two professional dog walkers, one full-time “Tribble stylist” and perhaps most unusual of all a “live-in Hillary Clinton Impressionist” supposedly used for “debate prep”. Of course given the sordid details revealed about Trump’s “Favorite Fantasy Scenario” in the Ashley Madison hack, he likely has other uses for the unfortunate impressionist.

"Hillary Clinton Freed a Rapist, Laughed About It-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-05-02 15:31:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-freed-rapist-laughed/"," While a practicing criminal defense attorney in 1975, Hillary Clinton got a 41-year-old man cleared of rape charges after successfully arguing that his 12-year-old victim made up the story and enjoyed fantasizing about older men. "," Memes about Hillary Clinton’s 1975 defense of a child rapist are a combination of fact and fiction. Hillary Clinton first faced criticism over her handling of the rape case in 2014. Clinton was a 27-year-old criminal defense attorney working at the University of Arkansas’ legal aid clinic when a judge appointed her to represent Thomas Alfred Taylor against allegations that he had raped a 12-year-old girl. Although Taylor faced 30 years in prison, Clinton successfully challenged the state’s evidence and negotiated a plea deal that landed her client in jail for one year, which was time he had already served, according to court documents . The case reemerged in 2014 after conservative news site The Washington Free Beacon published what have become known as the “ Hillary Tapes ,” in which Clinton can be heard discussing the case and how her client had passed a polygraph “which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs” in a 1980 interview. The victim of the alleged 1975 rape told the Daily Beast that Hillary Clinton had “took me through hell” in a 2014 interview : Hillary Clinton took me through Hell,” the victim said. The Daily Beast agreed to withhold her name out of concern for her privacy as a victim of sexual assault. The victim said if she saw Clinton today, she would call her out for what she sees as the hypocrisy of Clinton’s current campaign to fight for women’s rights compared to her actions regarding this rape case so long ago. “I would say [to Clinton], ‘You took a case of mine in ’75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me. And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape laughing.” The victim’s allegation that Clinton smeared her following her rape is based on a May 1975 court affidavit written by Clinton on behalf of Thomas Alfred Taylor, one of the two alleged attackers, whom Clinton agreed to defend after being asked by the prosecutor. Taylor had specifically requested a female attorney. Allegations about how Hillary Clinton portrayed the victim proved to be mostly true when an affidavit filed by Clinton in the case was made public: Hillary Clinton later defended her handling of the case in a 2014 interview with Mumsnet, a British-based online news site geared toward parents: “When I was a 27-year-old attorney doing legal aid work at the [University of Arkansas] where I taught in Fayetteville, Arkansas, I was appointed by the local judge to represent a criminal defendant accused of rape. I asked to be relieved of that responsibility, but I was not. And I had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability, which I did. When you’re a lawyer you often don’t have the choice as to who you will represent. And by the very nature of criminal law there will be those you represent you don’t approve of. But, at least in our system, you have an obligation. And once I was appointed I fulfilled that obligation.” Questions about Hillary Clinton’s handling of the 1975 rape case reemerged during the 2016 presidential in a YouTube video titled “I Thought You Should Know” and a series of memes posted online: Based on Hillary Clinton’s 1975 affidavit, some of the claims made in the above meme are true. She argued that the child was “emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and to engage in fantasizing” in requesting a psychiatric evaluation of the victim. However, the claim that Clinton later laughed about the case in the 1980 interview is false. Clinton can be heard nervously laughing at one point during the interview, but it was not about successfully manipulating the legal system or getting her client (mostly) cleared of the charges. The same (false) claim appears in this popular meme: So, given all that, we’re calling claims about Hillary Clinton’s handling of the 1975 rape case are a combination of truth and fiction.

"Swipe Your Driver’s License for $10 of Free Gas-Fiction!","2016-04-25 13:29:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/swipe-drivers-license-10-free-gas/"," A viral video says you can get $10 in free gas by swiping your driver’s license at the gas pump because that’s how money left over from primary election campaign funds is being divvied up. "," A rumor that you can get $10 in free gas when you swipe your driver’s license is false. A video posted on Facebook that made that claim had been viewed more than 2.5 million times a week after it was posted on April 19. In the video, a man swipes his Texas driver’s license and then supposedly pumps $10 worth of “free” gas. He explains that the free gas is how leftover campaign funds from primary elections are divvied up. The first clue that this video is a hoax is that the gas pump’s card reader beeps with an invalid card alert after the man swipes his driver’s license. That means the reader was unable to process his card. The second clue that Chet Johnson, the man who posted the video, was using not-so-subtle slight of hand is that he doesn’t show the gas pump’s message display screen on the video before he swiped his card. That obviously means the “$10 Prepaid” message on it was almost certainly there even before he swiped his card. And when viewers of the video commented that could get $10 in free gas from swiping their driver’s license, Johnson egged them on by saying he’d heard “you had to be a registered to vote for it to work.” In reality, the trick didn’t work because the video is a hoax. The Federal Elections Commission (FEC) has very specific rules for unused campaign funds, and divvying them out in $10 worth of free gas isn’t part of it. Mental Floss explains : Here’s what a campaign committee is allowed to do with any lingering cash: it can donate the funds to charities or political parties; it can contribute $2000 per election to other candidates; and it can save the money in case the candidate chooses to run again. However, those regulations don’t apply to the relatively new super PACs (Political Action Committees); this is only the second election where they have played a role, and there are currently no rules to stipulate what happens to that money beyond that it cannot go to fund another federal candidate. Much of that money tends to be returned to its original donors, used to wrap up the failed campaign, or donated to back a state-level candidate. The goal, however, is always to spend all of that money. Besides that, primary elections weren’t over when the video went viral, so there aren’t weren’t any “left over primary election funds” to speak of. For all those reasons, we’re calling this one fiction.","Politics"

"," Reports that a 1963 photo proves that there’s a link between Lee Harvey Oswald and Rafael Cruz, Sr., Ted Cruz’s father, are unproven. Rumors of a link between Rafael Cruz and Lee Harvey Oswald first surfaced in the blogosphere in April 2016. The photo shows Lee Harvey Oswald handling out “Fair Play” leaflets, and a man standing nearby in the background has a passing resemblance to a young Rafael Cruz: The Wayne Madsen Report , one of the first blog sites to claim that Rafael Cruz was the man pictured near Lee Harvey Oswald states : Previous questions have surfaced about the 1960s activities of Rafael Cruz, Sr., the father of GOP presidential hopeful Rafael Cruz, Jr. (Ted Cruz). Based on the presence of the elder Cruz, an anti-Castro activist, in Dallas and New Orleans before the November 22, 1963, assassination of President John F. Kennedy, there is a strong reason to believe that Cruz was associated with Central Intelligence Agency’s anti-Castro operations. The story went viral after the National Enquirer joined the fray with a story headlined , “Ted Cruz Father Linked to JFC Assassination,” on April 20. Here’s what we know for certain about the photo: it was taken in New Orleans on August 16,1963. A video of the Oswald handing out pro-Cuba fliers that day can be viewed here . Other photos of Oswald handing out fliers that day have also been in circulation for decades . Here’s what we know about Rafael Cruz, Sr: He was born in Cuba and came to the U.S. in 1957 on a student visa after opposing Batista’s regime as a teenager. He apparently didn’t speak English and spent his early years working as a dishwasher. Here’s the photo from his 1957 student visa application: There’s no doubt that there’s at least a passing resemblance between Rafael Cruz, Sr., and the man in the Lee Harvey Oswald photo. But there’s no way to confirm that the man in the photo was Rafael Cruz 50 years later without some kind of other supporting information. Also, even if the man in the photo with Lee Harvey Oswald was Rafael Cruz, Sr., that wouldn’t tie him to Kennedy’s assassination, as the National Enquirer claims. The photo was taken in August and Kennedy was assassinated in November, so plenty of time passed between the two events. Given lack of any proof besides a passing resemblence between the man in the photo and Rafael Cruz, we’re calling this one “unproven.”","Politics"
"“Understanding Donald Trump” by Newt Gingrich-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-04-15 14:00:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/understanding-donald-trump-newt-gingrich/"," An editorial titled “Understanding Donald Trump” that has been making the rounds has been attributed to Newt Gingrich. "," Newt Gingrich wrote the “Understanding Donald Trump” editorial, and it was published in the Washington Times on January 6, 2016. In the editorial , Gingrich discusses how he read Trump’s 1986 “Art of the Deal” over Christmas, and marvels at how Trump had “developed a remarkable seed of rules and principles that allow him to make decisions with incredible speed.” Gingrich recounts his favorite example from the book, how Trump fixed New York’s Wooman Rink after years of disrepair: New York City tried for six years to fix it, spent $13 million, and the rink still was not ready to open. In June of 1986 Mr. Trump, who could see the rink from his apartment, finally got tired of the embarrassment and offered to fix the rink at his own expense. At first the city turned him down because its bureaucracy did not want to be    embarrassed by someone fixing something they couldn’t fix. Mr. Trump kept pushing and finally out of embarrassment the city gave in. The key part of the story is Mr. Trump’s reaction to being put in charge. He promptly recognized that he didn’t know anything about fixing a skating rink. He asked himself who built a lot of skating rinks. “Canadians!” he concluded. He found the best Canadian ice skating rink construction company. When the Canadians flew in to assess the situation, they were amazed at how bad the city had been at solving the problem. They assured Mr. Trump that this was an easy job. Mr. Trump fixed the 6-year-old embarrassment two months ahead of schedule and nearly $800,000 under budget. (The city did end up paying for the work, and Mr. Trump donated the profits to charity.) Gingrich goes on to write that the book is filled with similar examples of Trump’s ability to delegate tasks to solve complicated problems, which has been part of Trump’s presidential platform. New Gingrich has touted Trump throughout the campaign. He said in February that it was time for the GOP to see Trump as the “inevitable nominee,” and he said Trump would “tower over” his competitors on Super Tuesday, for example. Gingrich has stopped short of publicly endorsing Trump, but that hasn’t stopped rumors that Gingrich had undertaken a “ secret campaign ” for Trump. ","Politics"

"Emory University Students Receive Counseling After “Trump 2016” Chalkings-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-03-29 09:14:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/emory-university-students-receive-counseling-trump-2016-chalkings/"," Claims that students at Emory University were offered counseling after pro-Donald Trump slogans like “Trump 2016” were chalked around the university’s campus have gone viral. "," Claims about Donald Trump chalkings at Emory University and student counseling that followed are mostly true, but they’re also misleading. It’s true that students were offended by pro-Donald Trump slogans that were written in chalk around the campus — and around buildings used by black and Latino students in particular — without proper permission. But claims about counseling offered to those students are misleading, and borderline false. First, we’ll start out by providing some background. An unknown group wrote pro-Donald Trump slogans like “Accept the Inevitable: Trump 2016” and “Build a Wall” around Emory University’s campus on March 21st. That sparked outcry, backlash and protest from students who found the slogans intimidating or offensive given the tone of Trump’s presidential campaign, student newspaper The Emory Wheel reports . A statement released by a group of Emory University students provided context into why some were offended and/or intimidated by the pro-Trump chalkings. The group explained that posters and slogans also appeared around the campus before the Georgia primaries, but the March 21st chalkings were different because of their volume and placement near buildings where black and Latino student groups gather. The fact that chalkings were written anonymously, and without university permission, were aggravating factors, according to a statement in Black Star Magazine : On Monday, March 21st, 2016, students on Emory University’s campus were met with an overwhelming number of pro-Donald Trump messages, which were chalked onto buildings, walkways, brick and concrete around campus.  The messages included, but were not limited to: “Vote Trump 2016”, “Build a Wall”, and “Accept the Inevitable Trump 2016.”  Prior to the Georgia Primaries, posters and chalkings also appeared on campus in favor of various candidates including Donald Trump.  However, in this situation, permission was granted from the University, and posters were placed in an observant manner.  On the 21st of March, the intense presence of pro-Trump statements and/or rhetoric could be seen in every direction students walked. Most notably, in the Dobbs University Center–where the Black Student Union, Centro Latino, and main dining hall are located–the phrase “Vote Trump 2016” was deliberately placed on 58 steps. This means, Black and Brown students saw these messages on their way to class, meals, and their places of fellowship. Trump’s messages of division (racist, xenophobic, homophobic, ableist, and sexist) make reference to anon-post racial state. Fellow students’ complacency with the narratives of Donald Trump and the aggressive condemnation of Black and Brown students’ responses reflects a lack of concern for the very real consequences of his campaign policies. In The Emory Wheel , University President James W. Wagner discussed the chalkings, student protests and the response of the administration, including “structured opportunities for difficult dialogues,” which clearly meets the definition of counseling : “Look, I’m so pleased I was in the building when [the protesters] arrived,” he said. “The opportunity to listen and their willingness to try to explain more and more clearly to me the root of the concerns was very effective.” In a campus-wide email, Wagner outlined four steps that administrators plan to take in order to address the issues raised by the protesters. He proposed “immediate refinements to certain policies and procedural deficiencies; regular and structured opportunities for difficult dialogues; a formal process to institutionalize identification, review and addressing of social justice opportunities and issues; and commitment to an annual retreat to renew [their] efforts.” So, it’s true that Emory University students were offered “structured opportunities for difficult dialogues” with other students and campus faculty — but the insinuation that this was a form of grief counseling is misleading at best. It would be more on par with a form of couples therapy with ultimate goal being conflict resolution. Ajay Nair, the senior vice president and dean of campus life at Emory University, provided more insight about the administration’s response in a post that appears at Inside Higher Ed : The intensity, timing and anonymity of the “Trump 2016” chalking incident produced a tipping point. In the context of a college campus, we thrive on open and civil dialogue, inviting even the most controversial perspectives and remarks. The college setting is a laboratory where students may, for the first time, grapple with such issues. Those conversations by their very nature can be difficult and Demeaning language and personal threats are counterproductive and undercut the arguments that prioritize open expression, as well as those that call for a more sensitive community. It is unequivocally wrong to suggest that students who support the Trump 2016 campaign should not have a right to express their support. Similarly, students opposed to the campaign have the right to express their views on what Trump 2016 means to them. One of our fundamental responsibilities as educators is to encourage respectful student activism across the array of complex public issues that challenge our nation and the world. So, again, Nair reiterated that there should be room on campus for those who support Donald Trump’s message and those who oppose it to express their views — and that educators needed to encourage “respectful student activism.” One way to do that is through the “structured opportunities for difficult dialogues” that Wagner referenced. So, given all that, we’re call this one mostly truth and misleading. It’s true that students were upset and offended about the Trump graffiti, but claims about counseling offered to them are misleading. ","Politics"

For his part, Ted Cruz called the report “garbage” and accused Donald Trump’s campaign with planting the story in a Facebook post: And even though the National Enquirer has become infamous for fictional reports about aliens and mutated humans, Donald Trump noted that the supermarket tabloid has broken a number of factual political stories, including John Edwards’ affair with a videographer for his presidential campaign while his wife underwent cancer treatments. That might be true, but the National Enquirer has also been behind countless fictional news stories over the years. And with the John Edwards story, the National Enquirer quickly followed up its initial report with photographic evidence of Edwards visiting his pregnant mistress that blew the story wide open — that’s not the case with the Cruz report. That’s why we’re calling this report about Ted Cruz having affairs with five different women “unproven.” ","Politics"

You can have pornography on TV or the Internet, but you better not put a nativity scene in a public park during Christmas; we have eliminated all criminals in America, they are now called sick people; we can use a human fetus for medical research but it’s wrong to use an animal. We take money from those who work hard for it and give it to those who don’t want to work; we all support the Constitution, but only when it supports our political ideology; we still have freedom of speech, but only if we are being politically correct; parenting has been replaced with Ritalin and video games; the land of opportunity is now the land of handouts; the similarity between Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf Oil spill is that neither president did anything to help.

And, that’s just for the ones we know about from the State Department. That does not include the ones that the FBI is, in fact, recovering from her hard drives. Ingraham: So, Hillary testifies on Capitol Hill and says she did not receive classified – did she say receive or send? You always have to parse the words with Hillary. That is false. Correct? DiGenova: She has actually said both things. And, she’s also then modified to say, none of them were marked classified. But, she has definitely made false statements, under oath, both in interviews and on Capitol Hill. She has not yet been interviewed by the FBI in their investigation. That will be the final step in her investigation. But, as a matter of fact, the Bureau has so much information about criminal conduct by her and her staff that there is no way that they walk away from this. They are going to make a recommendation that people be charged and then Loretta Lynch is going to have the decision of a lifetime. Ingraham: Do you have confidence that Loretta Lynch, from what we saw with her handling of the Baltimore riots and all that, is going to okay, green light an indictment of Hillary Clinton in an election year? DiGenova: I believe that the evidence that the FBI is compiling will be so compelling that, unless she agrees to the charges, there will be a massive revolt inside the FBI, which she will not be able to survive as an Attorney General. It will be like Watergate. It will be unbelievable. The evidence against the Clinton staff and the Secretary is so overwhelming at this point that if, in fact, she chooses not to charge Hillary, they will never be able to charge another federal employee with the negligent handling of classified information. The intelligence community will not stand for that. They will fight for indictment and they are already in the process of gearing themselves to basically revolt if she refuses to bring charges. Intelligence officials have claimed that Hillary Clinton’s email server contained information that was classified as “beyond top secret,” or Secret/Special Access Program (SAP), the intelligence community’s internal watch dog wrote in a letter to lawmakers . For her part, Hillary Clinton has disputed those reports , and it’s still not clear exactly what information those emails allegedly contained. TruthorFiction.com previously investigated claims that Hillary Clinton’s email server contained SAP information, and we deemed it “unproven” due to lack of information. Click here to read that report. But we can say Joe DiGenova’s central claim — that charges related Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server — will somehow disqualify her from running for president, have proven false. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey initially made that claim in August 2015, but he later changed his mind and said he was wrong. TruthorFiction.com previously reported that the only U.S. Constitution outlines qualifications to be the president, and the only three are being at least 35 years old, having lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years, and having U.S. citizenship. That means criminal charges related to the email fiasco wouldn’t legally “disqualify” Hillary Clinton, but it could make her unelectable. So, Joe DiGenova predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to finish her presidential campaign, but that doesn’t make it true. That’s why we’re classifying this one as “commentary.” ","Politics"

"Why Hillary Clinton Was Really in Beaumont, Texas-Truth!","2016-03-17 13:18:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-really-beaumont-texas/"," Questions have surfaced about a fundraising stop that Hillary Clinton made in Beaumont, Texas, in January. "," It’s true that Hillary Clinton attended a private fundraiser in Beaumont, Texas, in January. The January 20th fundraiser in Beaumont was listed on Hillary Clinton’s official campaign calendar , so that was easy to confirm. And two specific rumors about the fundraising stop were also pretty easy confirm through local media reports. One of those claims is that just six supporters greeted Hillary Clinton upon her arrival at the airport. Another rumor claims that she was in Beaumont to meet with 150-200 Pakistani Muslims. They have appeared in forwarded emails and discussion forum posts under the headline, “Why was Hillary Clinton really in Beaumont, Texas?” Local television station 6 KFDM reported that just six supporters greeted Clinton at the airport, and that her security detail outnumbered the assembled crowd. Footage that the network aired from the airport shows that this was true. Here’s transcript of the report: Only six people were at the airport waiting for Hillary to arrive. Some supporters and others just wanted to catch a glimpse of the presidential candidate. A quiet afternoon at Jack Brooks Regional Airport with heavy security measures — Jefferson County sheriff’s deputies and members of Secret Service made sure that Hillary Clinton had a safe arrival for her private visit here in Beaumont. Secret Service escorted the former first lady from the plane to her car that drove her to the destination where her private visit took place. She didn’t say hello or visit with anyone while at the airport. So, it’s true that just six people greeted Clinton at the airport in Beaumont, as the rumor claims. But considering that the stop was for a private fundraiser, and there wasn’t any advanced notice that we were able to find, that’s not necessarily surprising. The second rumor — that Hillary Clinton traveled to Beaumont to meet with Pakistani Muslims — is also true, according to local TV station 12 News : Some estimates put the amount collected at half-a-million dollars, making it one of the top five private fundraisers Clinton has had in this country. Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed hosted the reception for Clinton at this home in West Beaumont. Former U.S. Representative Nick Lampson, who attended the event, says 250 people were there. Lampson says Clinton spoke about education, healthcare and individual freedoms for people of all backgrounds and faiths. Many of the Pakistanis at the event were pleased with Clinton’s vocal support of the Muslim religion. Aisha Zahid said, “Talking about Muslims and favoring Muslims,so I really appreciate her whatever effort she is making against Islamaphobia, so I really think she needs to be the next President of the United States.” 12 News also interviewed a number of arriving guests who identified themselves as Pakistani. So, based on local media reports and news footage of Hillary Clinton’s stop in Beaumont, we’re calling this one true.

"Bernie Sanders Gave Speech to Bank of America-Misleading!","2016-03-14 11:52:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bernie-sanders-gave-speech-to-bank-of-america/"," Despite criticizing Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to major banks, Bernie Sanders gave a speech to Bank of America and other corporate powerhouses on February 6. "," It’s true that Bernie Sanders gave a speech at a “Politics and Eggs” event cosponsored by Bank of America in February, but most details of this rumor are misleading. An article that appeared at Daily News Bin reported that Bernie Sanders had spoken at an event hosted by Bank of America, Comcast and AT&T — which are “the same” corporate interests that Hillary Clinton has been criticized for giving paid speeches to. The claim isn’t factually wrong — but it’s pretty misleading. First, Politics and Eggs is a nonpartisan even series organized by the New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics & Political Library at Saint Anselm College. Politics & Eggs is a “must-stop” for all presidential candidates, and every presidential candidate in the 2016 election cycle participated in the event series, according to event literature : Taking advantage of New England’s unique position as home to the nation’s first presidential primary in New Hampshire, the Politics & Eggs series was launched in 1996 as a forum for local business leaders to hear from presidential candidates in an intimate setting as they visit the Granite State to campaign and build early support. Since its inception, the breakfast series has played host to nearly every major party presidential candidate and is today considered a “must-stop” on the presidential campaign trail.”  In fact, Politics & Eggs made a cameo appearance in NBC’s hit show “The West Wing,” with candidates autographing the series’ signature wooden eggs. In recent years, the series has expanded to include issues forums held in the years between presidential election cycles. These events feature nationally known political figures, analysts, and respected journalists. And it’s true that Bank of America was listed as one of 20 corporate sponsors of the event series, as the rumor claims — but that’s where the rumor starts to jump the rails. The claim is intended to portray Bernie Sanders as a hypocrite because he’s repeatedly called on Hillary Clinton to release transcripts of paid, private speeches that she gave to investment banks like Bank of America. But, considering that a video of Bernie Sanders entire speech is available online, that claim doesn’t hold up. Also, Bernie Sanders (and other critics) have argued that Hillary Clinton reportedly receiving millions of dollars from investment banks like Goldman Sachs proves she has a “cozy” relationship with Wall Street. But there’s no indication that candidates who participate in the Politics & Eggs event series are paid in any way, so comparing Hillary Clinton’s paid speaking engagements is misleading. Finally, Hillary Clinton participated in the Politics & Eggs event series on October 28, so both candidates are on even ground in that respect. ","Politics"

I sometimes joke that I ran his first company for him, Company “A.” People don’t really change much from the ages of 17 and 18, and I know this guy. I know him to be a good decent guy.

"Claims About Trump University Being a Scam-Truth! & Fiction! & Disputed!","2016-03-09 10:42:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-trump-university-scam/"," Questions have been raised about whether or not the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly known as Trump University) scammed its students, and what its Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating was. "," Trump University is facing class-action lawsuits from former students who claim that they were scammed, but there aren’t any clear answers aside from that. Former Trump University students in California have filed class action suits, and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has brought a separate case against Trump University in New York. Politico describes the lawsuits as : Former Trump University students have been suing Trump in California since 2010, and the case could head to trial this year. They allege Trump University charged them as much as $35,000 for real estate seminars and mentoring that did not teach them the skills they needed to become real estate investors. A separate case brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman makes similar claims. The case could go trial by the end of 2016. Questions about whether Trump University was a scam or not probably won’t be resolved until then. There have also been specific questions about what grades the Better Business Bureau gave to Trump University over the years. Trump argued after a Republican debate that it’d been given an A plus by the BBB, while critics have argued that the BBB gave Trump University a D minus. As it turns out, both claims are true. The BBB released a statement clarifying that Trump University had been given multiple grades over the years ranging from A pluses to D minuses. BBB doesn’t currently grade Trump University, according to the statement : March 08, 2016 Over the past week, Better Business Bureau has provided several statements in response to public inquiries about the BBB Business Review for Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University). These statements remain available on our website. We are issuing a further statement today, in response to a number of inaccurate reports that continue to be repeated. For purposes of this statement, we will refer to Trump University, which is how it is most often referred to in news stories. There is only one BBB Business Review for Trump University, and we noted the name change to Trump Entrepreneur Initiative  when it was brought to our attention by the company. 1 BBB did not send a document of any kind to the Republican debate site last Thursday evening. The document presented to debate moderators did not come from BBB that night. 2 Trump University does not currently have an A rating with BBB. The BBB Business Review for this company has continually been “No Rating” since September 2015.  Prior to that, it fluctuated between D- and A+. 3 The document posted on social media on Thursday night was not a current BBB Business Review of Trump University.  It appeared to be part of a Business Review from 2014. 4 BBB ratings are based on information we obtain about a business, including complaints received from the public.  The reporting period is three years.  Detailed information about BBB ratings is available on all 5.3 million Business Reviews on our website, bbb.org. 5 At no point did BBB change the rating of Trump University based upon a demand from anyone.  BBB followed its standard evaluation process applicable to all businesses. 6 During the period when Trump University appeared to be active in the marketplace, BBB received multiple customer complaints about this business. These complaints affected the Trump University BBB rating, which was as low as D- in 2010.  As the company appeared to be winding down, after 2013, no new complaints were reported. Complaints over three years old automatically rolled off of the Business Review, according to BBB policy. As a result, over time, Trump University’s BBB rating went to an A in July 2014 and then to an A+ in January 2015. 7 Trump University has never been a BBB Accredited Business.  The document handed to the debate moderators on Thursday night could not have been an actual “Better Business Bureau accreditation notice” for this business. 8 To be accredited, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets BBB Accreditation Standards which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB publishes ratings for both Accredited and non-Accredited businesses when we have sufficient information and the business continues to operate. While a business may earn an A rating from BBB by improving its customer record over time, BBB Accredited Businesses must meet higher requirements. Businesses must first earn a high rating and confirm compliance with other BBB Accreditation Standards before being eligible for Accreditation.  Once Accredited, they are vetted annually and must maintain compliance with the Standards to continue as a BBB Accredited Business. A lot of questions remain about Trump University, and unfortunately we won’t be able to answer them until ongoing lawsuits are resolved. ","Politics"

"," This quote has been correctly attributed to Mark Cuban. Mark Cuban wrote on his Cyber Dust app in July 2015 that Donald Trump had changed politics with his truthful answers and unpolished ideas: “I don’t care what his actual positions are,” Cuban wrote. “I don’t care if he says the wrong thing. He says what’s on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years. Up until Trump announced his candidacy the conventional wisdom was that you had to be a professional politician in order to run. You had to have a background that was politically scrubbed. In other words, smart people who didn’t live perfect lives could never run. Smart people who didn’t want their families put under the media spotlight wouldn’t run. The Donald is changing all of that. He has changed the game and for that he deserves a lot of credit. Now maybe we will accept candidates warts and all and look at what they can do rather than what headlines they create. Congrats Donald.” But the Cuban-Trump honeymoon appears to have long since ended. In a December 2015 video clip , Cuban makes a crude juke about Donald Trump’s run for the presidency: He’s just getting started. Seriously, there’s so much more to come because they’re not playing for real yet. There’s nothing really at stake. This is all just chitchat. He’s just warming up the audience. He’s the guy who walks into the bar and will say whatever he has to say to get laid … only in this case he’s not trying to f**k a girl, he’s trying to f**k the country. Then, in a February 2016 interview with Bloomberg Business , Mark Cuban said that he could do a better job as president than Donald Trump: Should I be in Trump’s position? I think I’d do a better job. I mean, I have young kids, and I think, honestly, that entrepreneurs can have more impact on this country and this world, and innovators can have more impact on this country and this world than the president of the United States. So, Mark Cuban’s views on Donald Trump have clearly evolved over time. But the quote in question really did come from Cuban. ","Politics"

"," This one started out as true, but Michael Mukasey later said he was wrong to say that Hillary Clinton’s email controversy disqualifies her from running for president. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey originally made the comments on MSBC’S “Morning Joe” in August 2015. And, although it’s been widely reported that Mukasey said Clinton’s use of a private email server disqualifies her, he actually said she would be disqualified for deleting server information, according to an MSNBC clip that can be viewed here : “I think the more dangerous part of this, from her standpoint, is not so much the placement of the material here as wiping the server. Number one, that’s a felony, but that statute disqualifies you from holding any further office in the United States and she’s running for a further office under the United States.” Mukasey referred to a statute that makes it a federal crime to file false crop or weather reports and forbids federal employees from falsifying financial records: (a)Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b)Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. But Mukasey later backed off the idea that Hillary Clinton should be disqualified for running for president. Specifically, NBC News reported that Seth Barrett Tillman, a former teacher at Rutgers Law School, argued that applying the statute to presidential candidates would be unconstitutional because “the only limits on qualifications to be president are in the Constitution — having US citizenship, being at least 35, and having lived in the US at least 14 years.” Seth Barrett Tillman later clarified his position in an email to TruthorFiction.com: My position is that no federal statute, e.g. Section 2071, can add qualifications to elected federal positions, including the presidency. Those qualifications include: being a natural born U.S. citizen, being 35 years old or older, and 14 years residence in the United States, and also others listed in the Constitution….

"," Donald Trump’s family name was changed from Drumpf to Trump at some point in history, but it’s not accurate to say that the Donald’s real surname is “Drumpf.” That idea came from a segment on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” In the segment, which can be viewed here , Oliver discussed how the name “Trump” is often associated with power and prestige, and he continued: The very name Trump is the corner stone of his brand. If only there was a way to uncouple that magical word from the man he really is. Well guess what, there is. It turns out the name “trump” was not always his family’s name. One biographer found out that an ancestor had changed it from, and this is true, “Drumpf,” and Drumpf is much less magical… That much is true. Biographer Gwenda Blair wrote in her biography, “The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire,” that one of Trump’s ancestors had changed the name to Trump, probably while living in Germany in the 17th century. Blair expanded on the name change in an online Q&A with fans: I don’t think that the Trumps’ success depended on the accidents of history, except possibly for one accident and that was, that back in Germany in the 17th century, the original spelling of their name, which was Drumpf, shifted to Trump, which was an immense boost to later generations to America, because it allowed them to associate with the word trump: trump suit, trump card; it’s a wonderful name. But otherwise I think they had remarkable energy and drive and a very sharp eye for the main chance. And they would have found that chance no matter what the circumstances around them. So, it’s true the Trump family name was once Drumpf. But it’s not true that Donald Trump’s changed the name, or that he was once named Donald Drumpf. It’s not clear when the name-change happened, but a German newspaper confirms that Trump’s great-grandfather, Friedrich, was never called “Drumpf” in his homeland before he immigrated to America in 1885: His father Fred had perhaps not so with the Heimattreue: For decades, held the even scattered by the family rumor that the Trumps had Swedish ancestors. This should in the years after the war, when the Germans had fallen into disrepute, keep the business running. wanted to build a museum proud Only after Sweden Location Carlstadt, came out: No, Grandpa Friedrich was in 1885 emigrated from Germany. And he always said Trump, never Drumpf, even if this misinformation still persists.

Some people have said that it was irresponsible financial engineering, risk-taking, and profit-seeking, that led to the 2008 crash; that you shorted your own toxic mortgages in the most brazen securities fraud in financial history dynamiting the global economy; and that the exorbitant bonuses paid, the financial bailouts, the non-prosecutions created moral hazard, rewarded avarice, incompetence, corruption and vice. You and I know it is nothing of the sort. As leaders, innovators, captains of finance, you will always be subject of the jealous resentment, the petty tantrums of the unwashed masses, the insolvent, the irresponsible, the invidious, the losers. They will envy you, they will despise you, and they secretly want to be like you! Counter Punch added a “Satire Alert” to indicate that the post was not an actual transcript of Hillary Clinton’s Goldman Sachs speech, but rather a political parody that aimed to entertain, not inform, its readers. Other sites didn’t add the disclaimer, however, which led to widespread confrusion about whether the transcript was real or not. Hillary Clinton was reportedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to give a speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013. She’s faced questions about the speech indicating a “close” relationship with Wall Street investment banks throughout her presidential campaign, and she has resisted calls to release a transcript of the speech. During a televised town hall, Hillary Clinton said she would be “happy to release anything I have whenever everybody else does the same, because everybody in this race, including Sen. Sanders, has given speeches to private groups.” On other instances, Clinton said that she would “look into” releasing transcripts, but she hasn’t done so. Politico reported that Clinton was paid $225,000 for her Goldman Sachs appearances, and that Goldman staffers remember her praising the diversity of Goldman’s workforce, and downplaying the bank’s role in the 2008 financial crisis: “It was pretty glowing about us,” one person who watched the event said. “It’s so far from what she sounds like as a candidate now. It was like a rah-rah speech. She sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director.” At another speech to Goldman and its big asset management clients in New York in 2013, Clinton spoke about how it wasn’t just the banks that caused the financial crisis and that it was worth looking at the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law to see what was working and what wasn’t. “It was mostly basic stuff, small talk, chit-chat,” one person who attended that speech said. “But in this environment, it could be made to look really bad.” But Hillary Clinton’s staffers dismissed those recollections as “pure trolling” and didn’t provide any further details about the speeches.

"Abraham Lincoln Quote About Capitalism and Corruption-Correctly Attributed!","2016-02-26 12:43:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abraham-lincoln-quote-about-capitalism-and-corruption/"," A quote from Abraham Lincoln in which he warns about corporations being “enthroned” as a result of war and triggering an “era of corruption in high places” to follow has been making the rounds for years. "," Abraham Lincoln made this cryptic quote about capitalism in America after the war, and the corruption that would result from it, in a letter sent in 1864. The quote can be found on page 954 of the second volume of “ Abraham Lincoln: A New Portrait ,” a Lincoln biography written in 1931 by Emanuel Hertz. The quote appears in a letter from Abraham Lincoln to Col. William F. Elkins dated November 21, 1864: “We may congratulate ourselves that this cruel war is nearing its end. It has cost a vast amount of treasure and blood… It has indeed been a trying hour for the Republic; but I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war. God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless.” Lincoln’s long lost quote has gotten a lot of airplay over the years from those who believe that Lincoln’s prophecy about capitalism in America, and an unprecedented concentration of wealth resulting from “corruption in high places” has sadly come true. It’s made the rounds in countless chain emails and in discussion forum posts over the years. There’s been a lot of debate about whether or not the quote actually came from Lincoln. Author David Korten, for example, attributed the same quote to Harvey Wasserman in his 1995 book “ When Corporations Rule the World .” But Rick Crawford, a member of UC Davis’s computer science department, squirreled away in the university’s library until he found the definitive answer. Crawford explained that his research revealed that author Emanuel Hertz wrote that many popular accounts of Lincoln came from William H. Herndon (Lincoln’s lifelong law partner), and that Herndon said these accounts offered a “sanitized” portrayal of Lincoln and made him out to be a “wax figure”: By all accounts, Herndon was scrupulously honest and plainspoken. Hertz quotes Herndon’s characterization of the various “big-name” authors who relied on his collection for primary source materials: “They are aiming, first, to do a superb piece of literary work; second, to make the story WITH THE CLASSES AS AGAINST THE MASSES. [my emphasis added] It will result in delineating the real Lincoln about as well as does a wax figure in the museum.” In several books, I found numerous places where Lincoln spoke about Capital and Labor (“Workingmen”). Lincoln re-used his own material frequently, and virtually identical passages appear in several places. Lincoln praises the moral rightness o fboth Capital and Labor, but this is invariably in the context of a nation where NO MORE THAN ONE MAN IN EIGHT is a Capitalist or a Laborer, ie, where 7/8 of the population are “self-employed” on their own farms and homesteads. This social context of general self-sufficiency would explain how Lincoln could serve for years as a railroad corporation lawyer with (apparently) no qualms, yet pen the “corporations enthroned” passage to Elkins. Other critics have made the argument that even if Abraham Lincoln made the remarks, his work as an attorney representing railroad corporations cancels out his harsh criticisms of capitalism, corruption and concentrated wealth. We’re not going to weigh in on that debate, but there’s plenty of published information on it for anyone interested. So, in conclusion, we can confirm that this quote about capitalism and corruption really did come from Abraham Lincoln. ","Politics"
"KKK Members Appear at Trump Rally in Las Vegas-Mostly Fiction!","2016-02-25 08:44:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kkk-members-appear-at-trump-rally-in-las-vegas/"," Photos supposedly show KKK members dressed in white robs and holding signs supporting Donald Trump outside a Trump rally in Las Vegas. "," These photos are real, but they appear to show two African-Americans dressed as KKK members to protest Donald Trump, not actual KKK members supporting Trump outside a rally. Photos of what appeared to be KKK members holding signs supporting Donald Trump went viral shortly after Trump won the Republican caucus in Nevada in February. The photos got widespread exposure after Nevada Senate Minority Leader Aaron Ford tweeted that a friend had taken them outside a trump rally: The images sparked an immediate backlash, but online defenders of Donald Trump quickly pointed out that African-Americans appeared to be wearing the robes, not actual KKK members. Photos like this one have been used to argue that Trump protestors — not Trump supporters — wore the robes outside a Trump rally: And one of the photos shows a so-called KKK member holding a sign that says, “The New England Police Benevolent Association supports Trump! We support them!” A spokesperson for the group quickly released a statement saying that the protestors were attempting to smear the New England Benevolent Association, and that none of its members were associated with the KKK, The Wrap reports : “I can assure you of one thing: we don’t have any members that are members of the Ku Klux Klan,” the group’s executive director, Jerry Flynn, told TheWrap on Monday. Tony Archinski, the NEPBA’s director of administration, told TheWrap on Wednesday that the group was as baffled by the protest as everyone else. “We had nothing to do with that. Like everybody else we saw it on the Internet,” Archinski said. “I’m thinking that somebody just picked up on that and made themselves a sign.” Asked if the group had been the victim of trickery by people trying to make it look bad, he replied: “What do you think?” Archinski said he believed the group, which represents law enforcement officers across New England, was targeted because of its endorsement of Trump in December. For his part, Nevada State Sen. Aaron Ford said the race of those wearing the KKK robes doesn’t matter to him, because he said, “anyone engaging in what was observed yesterday deserves to be exposed, and that was the exact purpose of my post.” Ford continued : The fact that anyone — whether an actual member of the KKK or one pretending to be one to make a point — found it appropriate to wear white sheets and hoods yesterday should astound all but the purest of racists in our society. To be sure, everyone has a First Amendment right to freedom of speech. But again, similar to the cross-burning analysis Justice Thomas gave in Black, KKK regalia such as that present at one of yesterday’s caucus locations “subject its targets, and, sometimes, an unintended audience … to extreme emotional distress, and is virtually never viewed merely as ‘unwanted communication,’ but rather, as a physical threat[.]” I have heard about some caucusing at that site who, indeed, were subjected that those exact sentiments.

"Questions about Marco Rubio’s Gay Arrest- Reported as Fiction!","2016-02-23 15:13:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/questions-about-marco-rubios-gay-arrest/"," Rumors that Marco Rubio is gay and was once arrested for being intimate with a man in a park have persisted throughout the Florida senator’s presidential campaign. "," We couldn’t find any proof to support the rumor that Marco Rubio is gay, or of Rubio’s so-called “gay arrest” in a Florida park. Claims that Marco Rubio is gay are based on run-in that Rubio had with police in 1990. Rubio and two other men were reportedly arrested in May 1990 while hanging out in a park located in a high-crime area of Miami after it was closed. Rubio was arrested and charged with an unknown misdemeanor, but it was later dismissed. The Miami Clerk of Courts Office said Rubio’s case file has since been destroyed. The Washington Post first reported on details or Rubio’s arrest in January 2016: It was not far from there that Rubio’s arrest occurred. At 9:37 p.m. on Wednesday, May 23, 1990 — five days before Rubio’s 19th birthday and an hour and a half after sunset — a police officer was dispatched to Alice C. Wainwright Park, a shaded stretch of grass along Brickell Avenue where the neighborhoods of Brickell and Coconut Grove meet, according to a Miami police incident report. The park, studded with palms and gumbo limbo trees, offered a stunning vista of Biscayne Bay, a “millionaire’s view for the masses,” according to one newspaper review. …According to the Miami police incident report, a police officer arrived at the park at 9:47 p.m., 10 minutes after being dispatched. The report notes that Rubio and two other teenagers were inside the park after hours. In a recent interview, Angel Barrios — one of the men arrested with Rubio — said they were sitting in a car when they were approached by an officer. A spokesperson for Marco Rubio dismissed the run-in as youthful indiscretion. He told the Post that: “When he was 18 years old, he violated municipal code for drinking beer in a park after hours. He was never taken into custody, never hired a lawyer and never appeared in court. Why the Washington Post thinks this is a story is beyond me.” But that wasn’t enough to kill rumors about the run-in. Details about Angel Barrios, the man who was arrested along with Marco Rubio, have fueled speculation that Marco Rubio is gay, or was arrested for having sex with a man in the park that night. A post on Pastebin explains the theory : As a quick summary: we know that the man Rubio was arrested with in 1990 was sued by Miami in 2007 for running a gay pornography studio out of one of his properties. We believe the totality of the evidence strongly implies that Rubio was engaged in sexual relations with that man in 1990, and that’s why they were arrested. The story, published on January 21st, notes that Rubio was with his friend, Angel Barrios, and another unnamed young man, when they were stopped by the police in Alice C. Wainwright Park at about 10 PM on May 23, 1990. Unfortunately, the article does not give very much information about Mr. Barrios, other than the fact that he owns several coin-operated laundries in the Miami area. So we decided to try and find out who this guy is. His LinkedIn page was easy to find: www.linkedin. com/in/angel-barrios-19387360. Further searches revealed a case filed by the City of Miami against an Angel Barrios in 2007, seeking to enjoin him from allowing the use of his residential property for business purposes. What were these business purposes? The production of pornography for distribution over the internet, by a company named Flava Works. What kind of pornography? Gay pornography… Those rumors about Angel Barrio’s ties to gay porn can be traced back to a 2007 news report titled “The House Next Door.” It was reported that a house owned by Barrio’s father had been used to film male models for voyeur website. The men were paid $1,200 a month to live in the house with cameras filming their every move, including group sex acts. But Angel Barrios told the Miami New Times that reports about his involvement with the activities in the house, and the website, were false. His property management company rented the house to people who ran the website, the New Times reports : Today Barrios strongly denies he knew anything about the gay smut business. He says his property management company rented the house to Flava Works, the firm behind CocoDorm, with the understanding it was a “digital media” company. He didn’t know the truth, he says, until Channel 6’s report; the next day, Barrios recalls, a Miami Herald reporter knocked on his elderly father’s door to ask about the website. “We are not in the gay porn business. We are not in the straight porn business. We are not in the porn business,” Barrios says. “My poor father, he had no idea what was going on in there.” So, it’s true that one of Marco Rubio’s friends from nearly 20 years ago rented a house to someone who used it film gay pornography. But that doesn’t prove that Marco Rubio is gay, or that he was arrested for having sex in park in 1990. That’s why we’re reporting this one fiction. ","Politics"
"Bernie Sanders a Vietnam War Draft Dodger-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-02-16 10:18:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bernie-sanders-a-vietnam-war-draft-dodger/"," Bernie Sanders applied for “conscientious objector” status during the Vietnam War, which helped him to dodge the draft. "," Bernie Sanders applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War, but he was too old to be drafted by the time his number came up anyway. Rumors about Bernie Sanders “dodging the draft” first surfaced in August 2015. At the time, a Vietnam War veteran named Steve Wikert asked “how can Sander be commander in chief” given his record as a conscientious objector in an editorial published in the Des Moines Register : My question as a Vietnam veteran is: How on earth could a person claiming to be a conscientious objector become the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world? How could a conscientious objector decide whether to deploy troops or give orders to drop bombs in support of a crisis? How can a conscientious objector knowingly send troops where people will be injured or killed? How could he order his fellow Americans to go to war when he refused to go to war himself? Steve Wikert’s column, and questions about Bernie Sanders’ views on war, was cast into the limelight after Sanders nearly beat Hillary Clinton in the Iowa Caucus and then handily beat her in the New Hampshire primary. A campaign spokesperson for Bernie Sanders confirmed back in August 2015 that Sanders did in fact apply for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. Michael Briggs, a campaign spokesman, said in an email to ABC News that: “As a college student in the 1960s he was a pacifist,” Michael Briggs, campaign spokesman added in an email. “(Sanders) isn’t now.” The article goes on to report that Sanders voiced opposition to the Gulf War of the early 90s but voted in favor of a military response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a member of Congress. That would jive with the campaign’s claims that Sanders’ views on war and pacifism may have evolved over the years. Bernie Sanders also discussed his anti-war activism of year’s past during a presidential debate in October 2015 . But the important question remains: Did Bernie Sanders dodge the draft in the Vietnam War? First, it’s not clear whether the Selective Service approved Bernie Sanders’ application for conscientious objector status. The Selective Service says that applications can be granted for religious, moral or ethical beliefs, but that applications cannot be granted based on “politics, expediency or self-interest.” Even if Sanders were able to dodge the draft as a conscientious objector, he would have had to enlist in some form of “alternate service.” Second, there’s strong evidence that Bernie Sanders wasn’t drafted because he was too old by the time his number was called. A Military Times article reported as much in March 2013: On paper, Sanders doesn’t have a lot in common with veterans. He never served in the military because he was too old to be drafted when his draft number came up. He protested the Vietnam War as a University of Chicago student in the 1960s and stressed his opposition to the war during his failed Senate bid in 1971. So, it’s true that Sanders publicly opposed the Vietnam War and applied for conscientious objector status. But it’s not true that he was able to dodge the draft because of it — he was simply too old to be drafted.","Politics"

A similar comment that Joe Biden did make during a weapons control forum, however, has been taken out of context to make it appear that the vice president did say that. Joe Biden made the comment at a forum held at the Western Connecticut State University in Danbury in February 2013.

"," Orland Sentinel columnist Charley Reese wrote this column in February 1984, and it appeared under the headline, “545 People are Responsible for the Mess, but They Unite in a Common Con.” The “545 People” column, as it has become known, has taken on a life of its own over the last three decades. But many who read and repost the column don’t know much about it, or its author, and that has led to a few misconceptions. One big misconception is that “545 People” was Charley Reese’s final column. It’s not clear where that claim originated, but it’s falsely been used to add dramatic effect to Reese’s legendary column. It implies that either Reese was fired for expressing such a strong anti-establishment view, or that a legendary journalist had to sound off about a broken political system for one last time. In truth, it was far from Reese’s last column. Charley Reese worked as a writer and columnist for the Orlando Sentinel from 1971-2001. He had a plainspoken style, and, as a self-described conservative Democrat, people on both sides of the political aisle embraced his syndicated column. In another famous column published in 2005, Reese wrote that he switched from Democrat to Republican after JFK was elected, but switched back to Democrat after George W. Bush’s presidency. It’s also important to note that many different versions of “the last Charley Reese column” are circulating the web. Over the years, people have added and subtracted paragraphs at different times to reflect current politics. Reese told the Daily Hampshire Gazette in 2013 that he refers to it as the “column that wouldn’t die” or his “Frankenstein column” because of all the additions and subtractions.

The editorial paints Bernie Sanders as “an angry radical agitator who never accomplished much of anything.” We’re not going to weigh in on whether or not that sweeping claim is true, but the editorial does make a number of specific claims about Bernie Sanders that we can fact-check to help you form your own opinion. Sanders collected his first paycheck in his late 30s- Fiction! Bernie Sanders didn’t have a stable career after graduating from the University of Chicago in the early 60s, but he worked a variety of jobs (and collected paychecks) throughout the 60s and 70s. He was elected the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1981. Before that, Politco reports that Sanders worked as an aid at a psychiatric hospital, as a pre-school teacher for Head Start, as a property tax researcher for the Vermont Department of Taxes, and for a non-profit called the Bread and Law Task Force. Aside from a municipal pension, Sanders has no assets- Mostly Fiction! It’s true that Bernie Sanders listed only a municipal pension under his name on a financial disclosure form, but that doesn’t account for all of his assets. Bloomberg Media explains that assets like real estate, cars and federal retirement plans are not included on presidential financial disclosure forms. Candidates also give their financial holdings in broad ranges, which “offers a window into a candidate’s financial holdings, but the window is not crystal clear.” For example, Sanders and his wife, Jane, listed between $194,026 and $750,030 in financial assists (all in Jane’s name). The only asset listed under Sanders’ name was a municipal pension, but gain, that doesn’t mean it’s his only asset. For starters, he owns multiple properties. A campaign spokesperson has disclosed that Sanders owns two homes, one in Vermont and one in Washington. In his 2012 Senate personal financial disclosures, Sanders reported having a rental property in Burlington valued at up to $250,000 that generates up to $15,000 in annual income. So, it’s true that Sanders’ assets are minimal compared to other presidential candidates — but it’s not true that a municipal pension is his only asset.

"Marco Rubio Plagiarized Barack Obama’s 2008 Iowa Victory Speech-Reported as Fiction!","2016-02-03 13:20:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marco-rubio-plagiarized-barack-obamas-2008-iowa-victory-speech/"," Marco Rubio has been accused of plagiarizing the speech Barack Obama gave after unexpectedly winning the 2008 Iowa Caucus. "," Marco Rubio’s 2016 Iowa Caucus speech opened with the same themes as Barack Obama’s 2008 speech, but the claim that Rubio plagiarized the speech is false. Those accusations came up days after Rubio unexpectedly finished third, just behind Donald Trump, the odds-on favorite to win. Because Marco Rubio exceeded expectations in the caucus, his performance was viewed by most as a “win,” and his speech reflected that. The controversy started when Bloomberg Politics reporter Sahil Kapur tweeted about similarities between Rubio’s and Obama’s speeches on February 1st: That claim gained credibility after Jon Favreau, former director of speechwriting for Obama, tweeted that Rubio “could’ve at least thanked Obama for the opening line” of his speech: The opening lines of the two speeches are undeniably similar. After upsetting Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Iowa Caucuses, then-Senator Barack Obama delivered a speech that began: They said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn’t do… After finishing third, meanwhile, Marco Rubio’s speech began: So, this is the moment they said would never happen. For months, they told us we had no chance. For months they told us because we offer too much optimism in a time of anger we had no chance. For months they told us because we didn’t have the right endorsements or political endorsements we had no chance. They told me because my hair wasn’t gray enough and my boots were too high. They told me I needed to wait my turn, that I needed to wait in line. But tonight, tonight here in Iowa, the people have sent a clear message: After seven years of Barack Obama we are not waiting any longer to take our country back… Still, it can be argued that the two speeches are similar because the candidates were in similar situations at the time of their speeches. They were both underdogs, they both outperformed expectations, and they both defied critics. Underdogs in sports and politics use “they said it couldn’t be done” rhetoric to put their accomplishments into perspective all the time. Obama didn’t coin it, he popularized it. Besides Rubio, there are countless examples of the “they said it couldn’t be done” theme in popular culture. The theme was used in popular culture as far back as the 1920s. Even other Republican candidates in the 2016 election have used it. John Kasich repeated that phrase over and over again when he announced his candidacy in July 2015 : You know, they said it couldn’t be done .  We proved them wrong. And then at the ripe old age of 30, I decided I’m going to run for Congress.  My mother and father are, like, “Johnny, what are you doing now?”  Well, they said I couldn’t win, I was too young and, by the way , I was going to run against an incumbent in 1982, which was the worst year.  We lost 26 Republican seats that year.  I was going run against a guy with his degree from Harvard.  I knew I had an edge; clearly he couldn’t have gotten in to Ohio State. And in 1982 I was the only Republican in America to defeat a Democrat all across this country.  And guess what, here is the irony, I got to go to Washington and work with President Ronald Reagan, you know? They said it couldn’t be done, but we proved them wrong again . And then I got down to Washington and got on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years.  I found that these hammers and screwdrivers, they cost thousands of dollars and it was taking the resources from the people that needed it who were serving in the military.  We were wasting money and I said, “We need to clean this up,” and they’re like, “You know, come on, it’s the Pentagon.  You can’t—forget about it, it can’t happen.” Well, we passed some legislation and we made things right.  We saved money, we improved the system, and we helped the military. They said it couldn’t be done, and we proved them wrong again. Chris Christy also used “they said it couldn’t be done” over and over in his 2012 Republican National Convention speech : When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth, jobs and people leaving the state or I could do the job the people elected me to do – to do the big things. There were those who said it couldn’t be done . The problems were too big, too politically charged, too broken to fix. But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. They said it was impossible to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. Three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes. We did it. So, there are plenty examples of candidates (especially underdogs) using “they said it couldn’t be done” in their speeches. It was unusual (and questionable) for Rubio to open his Iowa Caucus speech with it given that Obama had done the same in 2008, but that doesn’t make it plagiarism. Given its wide spread use, it could just as easily be a coincidence. That’s why we’re classifying these plagiarism claims as fiction. ","Politics"
"Bernie Sanders Pays Interns $12 an Hour, Campaigns for $15 Minimum Wage-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-02-02 11:32:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bernie-sanders-pays-interns-12-an-hour-campaigns-for-15-minimum-wage/"," Bernie Sanders has campaigned for a $15 minimum wage, yet he only pays his interns $12 an hour. "," Claims about how much Bernie Sanders pays interns are true, but they’re also misleading. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders regularly called for a $15 federal minimum wage to help support working class families. Sanders’s campaign website lists raising the minimum wage as one of his issues : Millions of Americans are working for totally inadequate wages. We must ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. The current federal minimum wage is starvation pay and must become a living wage. We must increase it to $15 an hour over the next several years. It’s also true that Bernie Sanders pays interns $12 an hour. Full- and part-time internships are available to “recent graduates and those currently pursuing a degree,” according to Sanders’ Senate page: Interns are an integral part of our Senate operation and contribute greatly to the senator’s work on behalf of Vermont and the nation. Senate interns have the unique privilege of gaining an insider’s perspective on the legislative and representative process. Our Washington and Burlington offices offer paid full- and part-time internships tailored for recent graduates and current students at the undergraduate or graduate level. The issue came up when Bernie Sanders introduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour in July 2015. A short time later, The Daily Caller , a conservative news site started by Tucker Carlson, drew attention to the discrepancy with an article headlined “Bernie Sanders Demands $15 Per Hour Minimum Wage, Pays His Own Interns $12 PER HOUR.” The report is true, but it’s also misleading. Internships aren’t covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act ’s federal minimum wage provisions. Internships were carved out because they’re viewed as educational tools for college students and recent graduates to gain first-hand knowledge that will help them advance in a field. The Department of Labor uses a six-part test to determine whether interns for for-profit companies must be compensated, but given that politics isn’t (technically) a for-profit industry, and given the job description for interns, Sanders wouldn’t have to pay interns at all, but he does: Interns are an integral part of our Senate operation and contribute greatly to the senator’s work on behalf of Vermont and the nation. Senate interns have the unique privilege of gaining an insider’s perspective on the legislative and representative process. Our Washington and Burlington offices offer paid full- and part-time internships tailored for recent graduates and current students at the undergraduate or graduate level. So, it’s true that Bernie Sanders doesn’t pay his interns $15 an hour even though he has called for a $15 federal minimum wage. But internships aren’t governed by the same minimum wage laws as other positions because the “real world experience” they offer is deemed more valuable.","Politics"

"Marine’s Open Letter to Sarah Palin-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-01-26 14:05:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marines-open-letter-to-sarah-palin/"," A former Marine called out Sarah Palin for blaming her son, Trek Palin’s, arrest for domestic violence and weapons violations on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an open letter. "," We can confirm that a former Marine wrote an open letter to Sarah Palin in which he said she had used PTSD to “divert blame from her family’s abhorrent, violent behavior.” The open letter surfaced days after Sarah Palin said Trek Palin’s arrest for domestic violence was linked to PTSD, and more specifically, to President Obama for not doing more to help veterans. Palin delivered the remarks in a January XX campaign stop with Donald Trump in Kentucky, the Daily Mail reports : ‘I guess it’s kind of the elephant in the room – because my own family, going through what we’re going through today with my son, a combat vet having served in a Stryker brigade, fighting for you all, America, in the war zone. But my son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened,’ Palin said at the Wednesday rally. ‘They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country, and that starts at the top,’ Palin said. She continued to say it’s a ‘shame’ that military personnel come home and ‘have to wonder if they’re respected anymore’. ‘So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America’s finest that we’ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them,’ she said. In response, former Marine and Navy Officer Chris Marks wrote the open letter. The open letter, which was published on Marks’ personal blog site , begins: I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican.  I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD.  I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son’s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD.   Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family’s abhorrent, violent behavior. Marks also called for Palin to use her “celebrity status” to help veterans in a more productive, less political manner. And Marks wasn’t the only veteran that took exception with Palin’s comments.

"Charles Krauthammer: The Clinton Foundation is Organized Crime-Incorrect Attribution!","2016-01-12 13:41:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/charles-krauthammer-calls-the-clinton-foundation-organized-crime/"," An essay attributed to Charles Krauthammer calls the Clinton Foundation “organized crime at its finest.” "," Charles Krauthammer didn’t write this essay about the Clinton Foundation, but some of the essay’s claims are on point. The name of Charles Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and FOX News contributor, was first attached to an essay that accused the Clinton Foundation of money laundering, tax evasion and organized crime in early November 2015. The essay was widely forwarded in emails and posted at online discussion forums under Krauthammer’s name. One of the earliest versions of the essay appeared on a blog site called True News U.S.A on October 28, 2015, under the headline “ Charles Krauthammer on Hillary Clinton. ” In that version, Charles Krauthammer’s name is briefly mentioned in the opening, but the article was not attributed to him: Recently, Charles Krauthammer alluded that he had no doubt some of the 30k emails Hillary deleted from her private email server very likely had references to the Clinton Foundation, which would be illegal and a conflict of interest. The opening reference to Krauthammer refers to r emarks that he made on FOX News in July 2015 about Hilary Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state, and allegations that she erased some of them. Krauthammer said, “The real crime, so to speak — at least the political crime — is the fact that she unilaterally erased 30,000 of these (emails).” Charles Krauthammer didn’t make any reference to the Clinton Foundation or conflicts of interest, as the essay claims, but he did say that the most damaging emails had likely already been deleted. Krauthammer’s name may have been added to the byline to lend the essay credibility, he is a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, after all . Or Krauthammer’s name may have been added by mistake, too. His name was in the original headline, and it’s not immediately clear where the essay transitions from Krauthammer’s views on the Clinton email scandal to the (unknown) author’s views on the Clinton Foundation. But regardless of how it happened, this essay on the Clinton Foundation has been incorrectly attributed to Charles Krauthammer. Still, because there’s been plenty of reader interest, we’ll take a look at the money laundering and “organized crime” allegations that the essay makes about the Clinton Foundation. The essay claims that individual donors or foreign governments can set up a charitable organization in a country, like Canada. Then, they can bundle anonymous individual donations into one “massive donation” that is given to the Clinton Foundation through the charitable organization. This allegation is mostly true. The Clinton Foundation stopped accepting donations from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. But the Wall Street Journal reported in March 2015 that individual donors with direct ties to foreign governments had made millions in donations while Clinton was in office: All told, more than a dozen foreign individuals and their foundations and companies were large donors to the Clinton Foundation in the years after Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, collectively giving between $34 million and $68 million, foundation records show. Some donors also provided funding directly to charitable projects sponsored by the foundation, valued by the organization at $60 million. In April 2015, the Washington Post and Reuters revealed that a Canadian charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation had failed to reveal the identities of 1,100 donors, the claim directly referenced in the essay: The number of undisclosed contributors to the charity, the Canada-based Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, signals a larger zone of secrecy around foundation donors than was previously known. Details of the organization’s fundraising were disclosed this week by a spokeswoman for the Canadian group’s founder, mining magnate Frank Giustra. The Canadian group has received attention in recent days as a potential avenue for anonymous Clinton Foundation donations from foreign business executives, including some who had interests before the U.S. government while Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state. So, it’s true that the Clinton Foundation has come under fire for the disclosure of foreign donors while Clinton served as secretary of state. But then the essay goes on to claim that the Clinton Foundation gives “no more than 15% of the donations to charitable causes” and spent $8 million on travel in one year alone. This is misleading, and borderline false. For example, it’s true that the Clinton Foundation spent $8.4 million on travel in 2013. But, according to tax filings , 77% of those travel expenses were directed toward program services, and about 20% toward fundraising. So, just because expenditures are itemized as “travel” or “conferences” doesn’t mean they don’t directly support programming. ","Politics"

The report quoted Ted Yoho as saying: “I can’t remember which founding father said it, but he said, the ability to vote, but vote uninformed, is as tragic or as dangerous as having a loaded gun and not know how to use it,” said Yoho, responding to an audience member who claimed that absentee voting was destroying elections. “Obviously anyone who doesn’t own their own property is going to be pretty clueless when it comes to voting.” Like most fake news stories that go viral, however, this one holds a sliver of truth.

"," Donald Trump hasn’t been pulled from any GOP primary ballots, let alone from primary ballots in 5 states. Rumors that Trump would be pulled from ballots in “upwards of FIVE states” started with a report published by the Christian Times newspaper on December 23, 2015. The report, headlined, “BREAKING: Five states REMOVE Trump from GOP Primary Ballot!” claimed that Trump had been pulled from the ballots because “his candidacy was invalid per state laws.” According to the report: Election judges in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida all allegedly forwarded messages to the Trump campaign on Wednesday informing the Republican front-runner that his candidacy was invalid per state laws.  If not resolved by February 1st, Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination is effectively over. To make its case, the Christian Times linked to a news story from New Hampshire that actually debunks the claim that Trump had been removed from the ballot there. The report from ABC affiliate WMUR, dated November 24th, said that the Ballot Law Commission had thrown a challenge to Trump’s eligibility to appear on the GOP primary ballot: After a hearing that lasted about two minutes, the five-member commission voted unanimously that the challenge filed by Fergus Cullen was without merit because New York state election records clearly show that Trump is a registered Republican in that state. “Why are we here?” commission chairman Brad Cook asked Cullen. “This isn’t about whether we like Donald Trump,” Cook said. “If ‘Republican enough’ is what this commission had to do, heaven forbid, we’d be here all day.” “You are challenging someone’s filing,” Cook said. “This commission is not the forum for speeches or electioneering or advancing any other candidate. If you have any information that he is not in fact a Republican, then share it with us.” Cullen replied, “I do not have that information.” The commission then voted to dismiss the challenge. Other claims made in the Christian Times report are easy to debunk as well. Nevada and Iowa don’t even hold primary elections to select presidential candidates. Major political parties hold caucuses “at dates, times, and locations that they determine” to stump for candidates, according to state election policies . It would be impossible for Trump to be removed from primary ballots in those states because they don’t even have primary ballots. Although the claim that Trump had been removed from GOP primary ballots in five states is easy enough to disprove, a blog sites that re-reported the false story have sparked panic among Trump supports that elections officials were conspiring against him. Rest assured, Donald Trump hasn’t been removed from any primary ballots. ","Politics"

"," There’s no credible proof that Marco Rubio had an affair with a D.C. lobbyist, so we’re reporting this one as fiction. The rumor appears to have started when a blog site called FitsNews.com filed a report headlined, “Sources: Marco Rubio ‘Mistress Bomb’ About to Detonate.” The report cited “multiple” unnamed sources who said the mistress was identified by “researchers during a deep dive into Rubio’s disastrous finances.” The report continued : “There is a decent chance you are about to see this picture all over the place,” one of our sources said, directing us to the corporate webpage of a female Washington, D.C. lobbyist. Details of the forthcoming scandal are not yet clear, although the allegation involving Rubio and the female lobbyist is reportedly being leaked to “multiple mainstream media outlets” this week. FITS showed the webpage we were provided to a presidential operative in early-voting South Carolina.  This operative – who has worked on more than one presidential campaign during the current election cycle – confirmed that the woman on the webpage was “a focus” of opposition research against Rubio, however they declined to elaborate on what was uncovered. Then, on December 16, conservative commentator Alex Jones delved into the story at his Info Wars website. The report cited “rumors” that Rubio had had an affair, but, again, it provided no proof or evidence of those rumors being true. Unverified “rumors” surrounding Marco Rubio aren’t necessarily new, either. Back in 2013, Gawker followed up on a rumor that Rubio had an affair with a Tallahassee lobbyist, and another rumor that he had fathered two children by “a woman other than his wife.” That reporter concluded that both were nothing more than rumors . The most recent (unverified and unproven) claim that Marco Rubio had an affair with a D.C. lobbyist emerged in the thick of the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination in December 2015.

Bennett has an “interesting take on trump” and speculates, “They would kill him before they let him be president.” "," Bill Bennett isn’t behind the “Interesting Take on Trump” assassination theory. An essay titled “Interesting Take on Trump” was first posted in a political forum hosted by the website One Political Plaza on November 14, 2015. The person who posted it said they’d received it via email. From there, the “Interesting Take on Trump” essay was posted on other message boards and quickly went viral. These posts and chain emails claim that William J. Bennett, the host of Bill Bennett’s Morning in America Show, has speculated that someone — either Democrat or Republican — would conspire to assassinate Donald Trump rather than let him be president. There’s nothing linking Bill Bennett to the “Interesting Take on Trump” that has been attributed to him. No references to it appear in his radio show archive, or in his blog. Bill Bennett’s name was likely attached to the “Interesting Take on Trump” to lend it credibility, and it’s unclear where it came from. Also, the “Interesting Take on Trump” essay doesn’t jive with what Bill Bennett has publicly said about Donald Trump and his campaign. The essay makes a strong case for Trump to succeed as president because he’s a political outsider who’s beholden to nobody. Bill Bennett, meanwhile, said in an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity that he’s “not okay” with Trump’s candidacy: HANNITY: So you OK with a Donald Trump candidacy? BENNETT: No, I’m not OK at all! HANNITY: Why not? BENNETT: Because I look at a man and the totality of his acts and his record and the things he has and stood for. And I think, probably, he’s not very principled in terms of his convictions anyway, except he, you know, is a businessman who does things his way, his own idiosyncratic way. I do understand the appeal. People are angry, mad. And he seems big enough to kind of encompass that anger. Bill Bennett eventually said that he would vote for Trump if he won the GOP nominee only because he couldn’t vote for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but that’s not a very glowing endorsement. The “Interesting Take on Trump” essay that was incorrectly attributed to Bill Bennett theorizes that Trump poses a huge threat to the political establishment because he can self-fund his presidential campaign, which makes him beholden to nobody — a claim that’s not exactly true: It’s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We’re the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened like never before. Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It’s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It’s because most of the other politicians are part of the a ood old boys club. They talk big, but they won’t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations. . .like Big Pharma or Big Oil. In reality, “unsolicited donations” accounted for $4 million of Trump’s campaign budget and he had “self funded” $2 million of his budget through mid-November. The Sunlight Foundation reports that Trump has put more of his own money into the campaign than any other candidate has, but the idea that Trump is completely self-funded is misleading: While Trump has spent about $2 million of his own money since the start of his bid for the White House, he has also accepted nearly $4 million in “unsolicited donations,” according to the campaign’s latest financial filing. That means that more than 67 percent of Trump’s campaign cash has come from outside donors so far — vastly outpacing his own contributions. What is he doing with his cache cow? He’s burning through his stacks faster than any other candidate. While Trump has raised $5.8 million through June 30 (including the loans to his campaign), he’s spent $5.6 million, and not on the typical expenditures. Most of the establishment candidates focus their revenue on traditional means such as field organizing and ad buying; Trump sells merchandise, such as hats and shirts. And unlike other candidates, media exposure is the least of Trump’s concerns. Instead of paying for airtime and crossing his fingers for interviews, the Trump Effect has media outlets vying to cover him as much as possible. Yes, Donald Trump is putting more of his own money into his campaign than any other candidate — but the claim that he is purely self-funded is certainly misleading. So, it’s not true that “Interesting Take on Trump” came from Bill Bennett. Also, the central idea of that theory — that the Trump campaign doesn’t rely on outside funding — is misleading.

"," Ben Carson has not proposed a new tax system based on sin. Ben Carson, a presidential hopeful on the Republican ticket in 2016, has proposed a Biblical-based tax system — but tax rates would not be established based on sin under that tax system. Rumors that Ben Carson proposed to base a new tax system on sin started after the first Republican debate in August 2015. In the debate, Carson was asked about his plans for tax policy. The candidate responded : We need a significantly changed taxation system. The one that I’ve advocated is based on tithing because I think God is a pretty fair guy. He said, “if you give me a tithe, it doesn’t matter how much you make, if you had a bumper crop you don’t owe me triple tithes, and if you’ve had no crop you don’t owe me no tithes at all.’ So there must be something inherently fair about that, and that’s why I’ve advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes. If you make $10, you pay $1. Everyone get’s treated the same way. You get rid of the deductions and loop holes.” Tithing is a biblical concept that is referenced throughout the Old Testament. The concept entails giving one-tenth of your belongings to God — not paying for the number of sins you have. Ben Carson hasn’t gone into great detail about his tax plan, but most experts agree that it amounts to a 10% flat tax. The rumor that Ben Carson had proposed a new tax system based on sin started with a fake news report that was published after the first GOP debate in August. Newslo, a website that describes itself as a “hybrid News/Satire platform,” reported that Carson wanted to create a “biblical sin-based tax program”: Asked to elaborate, Carson said: “Well, basically, the system would work something like this: taxes would be calculated at the end of each tax year, or fiscal period, we would decide that later on, and then a person’s earnings would be compared and weighed against the amount or number of sins they have committed during the said tax period. Basically, the number of sins a person commits would be translated into a tax.” As is often the case with satirical and fake news websites, some readers missed the satire and though that that Ben Carson actually wanted to create a biblical sin-based tax program, but that’s not the case.

"Donald Trump Said Republicans are the Dumbest Group of Voters-Fiction!","2015-10-22 12:28:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-said-republicans-are-the-dumbest-group-of-voters/"," People magazine reported in 1998 that Donald Trump said Republican are the dumbest group of voters in the country and would “eat up” his lies if he ran for president. "," Donald Trump didn’t say that Republicans are the dumbest group of voters in a 1998 interview. The quote, which supposedly came from a 1998 People magazine story about Trump’s political aspirations, surfaced on social media in October 2015. A widely-shared meme shows a picture of Trump with this quote overlaid beneath: “If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.” – People magazine, 1998 We found several mentions of a possible Trump presidential bid in People magazine in the late 1990s — but we couldn’t find any instances of him calling Republicans “the dumbest group of voters in the country.” After reporting on rumors that Trump was thinking about running for president on multiple occasions, People reported in December 1998 that Trump had announced plans to explore the possibility. The article didn’t cite any specifics about Trump’s platform or party affiliation, but it mentioned a meeting between Trump and Jesse Ventura, the leader of the Reform Party at the time: Donald Trump declared Thursday he is moving toward a run for the U.S. presidency. “I will be forming a presidential exploratory committee,” Trump, 53, said on CNN’s “Larry King Live.” The New York real estate developer and New Jersey casino owner said his top choice as a running mate would be Oprah Winfrey. “She is terrific, ” he said. A Winfrey spokesperson said she is not interested. Trump, who claims he’ll pay his own campaign expenses, had dinner with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura Thursday. Ventura, leader of the Reform Party, has been recruiting Trump for months to seek his party’s nomination — but after the meal the two men joked to reporters that they were throwing their support behind their dinner companion, actor Woody Harrelson. Trump got a little more specific about his political views in the “Larry King Live” interview in which he announced that was forming a presidential exploratory committee. Trump said he was a registered Republican, described himself as a centrist, and talked about running on the Reform Party ticket, according to a transcript of the appearance : I think that nobody is really hitting it right. The Democrats are too far left. I mean, Bill Bradley, this is seriously left; he’s trying to come a little more center, but he’s seriously left. The Republicans are too far right. And I don’t think anybody’s hitting the cord, not the cord that I want hear, and not the cord that other people want to hear, and I’ve seen it. Plus, I think there’s a great lack of spirit in this country. You know, what happened over the last four years is disgusting, and I just think there’s a tremendous lack of spirit, and I think the spirit has to be brought back. In the end, we couldn’t find any instances of Donald Trump saying that Republicans are the dumbest group of voters. We’re calling this rumor fiction. ","Politics"
"Dr. Ben Carson Loses Medical License Because of “Brainless Comments”-Fiction!","2015-10-16 11:19:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dr-ben-carson-loses-medical-license-because-of-brainless-comments/"," Dr. Ben Carson has had his medical license revoked in all 50 states after making “brainless comments” on the campaign trail in his pursuit of the GOP presidential nomination. "," False reports that Dr. Ben Carson had lost his medical license because of comments that he made on the campaign trail have been fueled by a satirical story published by the Huffington Post . The story appeared under the headline, “Ben Carson Loses Brain Surgeon License After Making Numerous Brainless Comments,” had been shared on social media sites more than 17,000 times within days of its publication: The Medical Boards for all 50 States in the Union announced today that they have revoked Ben Carson’s medical license and will no longer allow him to operate as a brain surgeon any where in the U.S. And they cited as their reason Carson’s mental and intellectual challenges — otherwise known as the propensity to sound like a total and utter nutcase. In a joint statement, the Medical Boards said: We have been increasingly concerned about the gibberish emanating from Mr. Carson’s cerebrum. We cite by way of example his belief that the holocaust could have been prevented by armed German citizens, that straight people go into prison and come out gay, and that Obamacare is the worse thing to happen to the country since slavery. We are therefore suspending his medical license in any state where he is qualified to practice. And should he choose to come out of retirement and re-apply for credentials, we will not allow him to operate on people’s cerebrums, or indeed cerebullums, limbic systems and brain stems, until he can demonstrate that his own are in fully working order.” The story appeared in the “comedy” section of the Huffington Post website, but that was lost on many who followed a direct link to the story and were unaware that it was published as political satire. But, in reality, the scenario that the (fake) news report outlines for Ben Carson to lose his medical license isn’t possible. State licensing boards don’t decide who can perform brain surgery — individual hospitals do, according to a CATO Institute report : …In the United States, state licensing boards do not decide who actually conducts brain surgery. Medical licensing is not specialty-specific; licenses are given to graduates of medical school who have passed a comprehensive exam. They are not evaluated for specialty-related training, skills, or experience. Instead of government-sanctioned licensing boards, hospitals decide who may practice neurosurgery. Members of a hospital’s medical staff credential and privilege medical professionals, determining exactly what an individual may do. They verify and evaluate the education, skills, experience, malpractice history, and competency of each individual medical professional before the individual is granted the right to perform specific tasks. Health maintenance organizations go through much the same procedure, verifying a wide range of background information when they establish networks or panels of physicians from whom patients may seek care. They do this because they might be held liable for a mistake made by a credentialed care provider, and because their reputations matter… So, even if medical boards in all 50 states wanted to revoke Ben Carson’s medical license to perform brain surgeries (which they don’t), they wouldn’t be able to.

"“The Truth About Carly” By Former HP Board Member Tom Perkins-Authorship Confirmed!","2015-09-29 16:27:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-truth-about-carly-by-former-hp-board-member-tom-perkins/"," Former Hewlett Packard board member Tom Perkins wrote an essay titled “The Truth About Carly” that defends Carly Fiorina’s business track record. "," Former Hewlett-Packard board member and venture capitalist Tom Perkins purchased a full-page ad in the New York Times on August 27, 2015, to publish his essay, “The Truth About Carly.” Tom Perkins wrote “The Truth About Carly” in response to an earlier report by New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin headlined, “Carly Fiornia’s Business Record: Not So Sterling.” Sorkin wrote that Carly Fiornina had misrepresented her track record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard on the campaign trail. She made an “ill-fated” decision to merge the company with Compaq. The merger led to 30,000 layoffs and low stock prices before the it was eventually called off, and she was fired, Sorkin wrote: “When you manage in tough times, when you lead in tough times, sometimes tough calls are necessary, and yet we took that company from about $44 billion to almost $90 billion,” Mrs. Fiorina said to The Des Moines Register editorial board. “We took the growth rate from 2 percent to 9 percent.” Here’s the problem: Those numbers she is referencing aren’t Hewlett-Packard’s profit. They are the company’s revenue. And if you make enough acquisitions — especially one the size of Compaq — you can inflate your revenue figures. You can also buy growth. When a Washington Post columnist looked at her business record and suggested the numbers Mrs. Fiorina cited were misleading, her team attacked him in a point-by-point rebuttal, showing facts and figures from securities filings to back her assertions. The problem isn’t that the numbers aren’t accurate — they are; it is that the company’s expansion was a function of an aggressive acquisition strategy. The trick to real business success is increasing profitability. That’s where her explanation of her firing — “I was fired in a boardroom brawl,” she says — is only half right. It was a brawl, but the company was unquestionably damaged. Sorkin concluded that Fiorina’s tenure as CEO of Hewlett-Packard should be viewed as a liability to her presidential campaign, not an asset. Tom Perkins argued the opposite in “The Truth About Carly.” He wrote that she had saved the company from ruin despite a dysfunctional board of directors: Carly was hired at HP because it was struggling. Revenues were down, quarterly earnings were missed, innovation lagged and growth stagnated. HP, once the leader in Silicon Valley, was clinging to the status quo and failing to embrace the new tech era. Silicon Valley companies were prospering by taking advantage of the new technologies; HP was stubbornly clinging to the past. HP needed a change agent and someone who could return the company to its glory days. Carly was the right choice. The results of Carly’s transformational leadership? HP revenues doubled to more than $80 billion, innovation tripled to 15 patents per day, the growth rate more than quadrupled 6.5 percent and we grew to become the 11th largest company in the country. Carly did what she was brought in to do: turn the company around make it successful again. Not only did she save the company from the dire straits it was in, she laid the foundation for HP’s future growth. ","Politics"

Conservative Starbucks investor Tom Strobhar told Schultz that the company’s earnings were “shall we say politely, a bit disappointing” in the first quarter after the National Organization for Marriage announced a boycott of Starbucks over its support of gay marriage. The Starbucks CEO responded : Despite the fact that you cite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38% shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, have returned 38% over the last 12 months. Having said that, it’s not an economic decision. The lens through which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ 200,000 people at this company, and we want to embrace diversity. Respectfully, if you can get a higher return than the 38% you got last year, it’s a free country; you can sell you shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. As the exchange made its way through the grapevine, it was (falsely) reported that the Starbucks CEO had said, “If you support traditional marriage, we don’t want your business.” Then, in March 2015, the Tea Party News Network breathed new life into the story when it re-reported the exchange as though it had just happened in a story headlined, “Starbucks CEO: If You are Anti-Gay Marriage, ‘You can Sell Your Shares.” That report is outdated and false.

Chris Christie has called for a reduction in teachers’ wages. “Teachers are paid too much, that’s what’s bankrupting the system,” Christie said. “Some teachers make six-figure salaries and that’s not including retirement benefits.” However, the teachers’ union points out only senior administrators make six figures and most of those jobs require doctorates.

"Nuclear Deal Sends $150 Billion to Iran-Mostly Truth!","2015-08-17 13:56:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nuclear-deal-sends-150-billion-to-iran/"," Donald Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that a nuclear deal with Iran would send $150 billion to Iran, even if it’s not approved by Congress. "," This one is mostly true, but some of the details are a little fuzzy. Donald Trump said that the $150 billion would go to Iran even if Congress didn’t approve the nuclear deal during an August 16 appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “The problem is by the time I get in there, they will have already receive the $150 billion. Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn’t believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich.” Under the nuclear deal, Iran would have access to billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign accounts due to previous nuclear sanctions. But the exact amount of Iran’s windfall, and the idea that Iran would get the assets even if Congress doesn’t approve the deal, aren’t sure things. Sanctions placed on Iran because of its nuclear program froze billions of dollars of Iran’s assets in foreign accounts. The nuclear deal would unfreeze those accounts, which the White House has estimated could send up to $150 billion to Iran. But Obama administration officials said that Iran wouldn’t receive the full $150 billion in frozen assets because the country owes billions to China and other countries. After repaying those debts, Iran would receive about $56 billion. Others have argued that Iran would leave the $150 billion in foreign accounts because repatriating it could hurt its economy, the Daily Beast reports : The money is unlikely to be repatriated back to Iran. Administration officials and critics alike predict that Iran will keep much of its assets overseas, since a sudden influx of funds into the country could drive up the cost of the Iranian currency, making it more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase Iranian goods and services. “It’s already in foreign accounts, so it’s not part of the normal budgeting process. It’s just ready cash… so you can start distributing it abroad very easily,” said Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Michael Doran. “It would be very easy for them not to repatriate it.” Also, the idea that the nuclear deal would send $150 billion to Iran even if Congress doesn’t approve it isn’t necessarily a given. Other countries would have to lift sanctions on Iran even if the U.S. doesn’t for that to happen. So, some of the details are up in the air, but the claim that the nuclear deal could send up to $150 billion to Iran is mostly true. ","Politics"
"Fox News Is Among Top 10 Clinton Donors-Misleading!","2015-08-13 09:54:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fox-news-is-among-top-10-clinton-donors/"," Fox News has been one of the top 10 largest donors to Bill and Hillary Clinton since 1992. "," This one is partially true, but it’s also misleading. Parent companies of Fox News — 21st Century Fox and News Corp — have been major donors to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s political and philanthropic activities over the years, but the Fox News Group is just one of many media holdings under the company. Fox News wouldn’t have had any say in how its parent companies make contributions, and it’s not uncommon for businesses to donate to candidates and causes on both sides of the aisle. The rumor that Fox News has been one of the top 10 largest donors to Bill and Hillary Clinton started in early July of 2015 as Hillary Clinton ramped up her presidential campaign. The rumor claims that 21st Century Fox/News Corp has donated more than $3 million to Clinton family accounts over the years, making it one of the Clintons’ top donors. It’s not clear where that $3 million figure comes from, but it appears to include political donations made to the Clintons, as well as donations made to the Clinton Foundation. Throughout her career, Hillary Clinton has received a total of $302,400 in political contributions from 21st Century Fox. That puts the media company 14th on Hillary Clinton’s list of all-time biggest donors. In the 2008 election cycle, 21st Century Fox donated $193,500 to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. That was enough to make it the campaign’s 12 largest donor, according to financial records . When it comes to the Clinton Foundation, the News Corporation Foundation (News Corp was the parent company of Fox News before a spinoff landed TV holdings under 21st Century Fox) has donated as much as $1 million to the foundation. James Murdoch, the COO of 21st Century Fox and son of Rupert Murdoch, has donated up to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation. But, again, it’s misleading to say that Fox News is one of the Clinton’s top 10 largest donors because the network doesn’t control the political and philanthropic contributions made by its parent company or executives. And, when it comes to media conglomerates like 21st Century Fox, it’s not uncommon for them to make large political contributions to candidates on both sides of the aisle to protect their business interests, 21st Century Fox explains : The government plays a significant role in how our business operates. From broadcast regulations to online advertising and intellectual property protection, legislators at both the state and federal levels have proposed numerous changes in public policy in these areas—some of which would help our industry, and some of which would limit our ability to achieve our goals. 21st Century Fox is active in the public policy process protecting the interests of our employees and shareholders. 21st Century Fox’s Political Action Committee —FOX PAC — is an integral component of our government relations strategy, which also includes grassroots communications and direct lobbying. These three elements work together to carry our message to Congress and to state office holders. The FOX PAC is a non-partisan PAC. Its focus is helping to elect quality men and women, regardless of political party, who are dedicated to providing leadership in public service and promoting sound public policy. FOX PAC is funded by voluntary contributions from eligible employees of the company, and is used to make contributions at the federal level and in states where allowed. So, this one is partially true — but more so misleading. ","Politics"

"," Claims made in the “Who is Donald Trump” video are true, outdated and disputed. The “ Who is Donald Trump ?” video was posted on a YouTube channel by TestTube News shortly after Trump announced his candidacy for president. The video makes a number of claims about Donald Trump’s personal, political and professional background in an effort to answer the question, “Who is Donald Trump?” Let’s take a look at some of the specific claims made in the “Who is Donald Trump?” video: Donald Trump’s Inherited a Real Estate Fortune from His Father- Truth! Donald Trump’s father, Fred C. Trump, was a successful real estate developer in New York City from the 1960s until the time of his death in 1999. During that time, Fred Trump built more than 27,000 apartments and row houses around New York City. The estimated value of his estate when he died from complications of Alzheimer’s disease in 1999 was as much as $300 million, according to his obituary . Donald Trump has argued that he inherited a (relatively) small amount of money from his father in comparison to his current net worth, which is true. But Trump also inherited his father’s real estate development company, which helped him build his current net worth. Donald Trump Filed for Business Bankruptcy Four Times- Truth! This one is true, but Donald Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. Trump filed business bankruptcy in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. Still, Trump argues that he has “never went bankrupt” and was simply using “the laws of the country” to make savvy business decisions. In a 2011 interview with ABC News , Trump said: I never went bankrupt. And let me just tell you. If you look at our great businesspeople today, Carl Icahn, Henry Kravis, (UNINTEL)– Leon Black of Apollo. All of them have done the same. They use and we use the laws of this country, the bankruptcy laws, because we’ll buy a company. We’ll have the company. We’ll throw it into a chapter. We’ll negotiate with the banks. We’ll make a fantastic deal. We’ll use those. But they were never personal. This is nothing personal. You know, it’s like on the Apprentice. It’s not personal. It’s just business. Okay? If you look at our greatest people, Carl Icahn with TWA and so many others. Leon Black, Linens-n-Things and others. Henry Kravis. A lot of ‘em, everybody. But with me it’s “Oh, you did–” this is a business thing. I’ve used the laws of this country to pare debt. In one case, with the casinos, which I don’t– which I haven’t even run for many years. But I did very well with the casinos, very well. But then what happened with Atlantic City was Philadelphia happened, lots of other places happened, Delaware and such. And what I did is reduce the debt from a billion eight to like $300 and some odd million, by using intelligently the laws of this country. Now, people could say, “Oh, gee, isn’t that terr–” I never declared– this is nothing to do with me, personally. This is just a business. I haven’t even run these things. I only owned a piece of them. I didn’t own the whole thing. I owned a piece of them. But if you look at our greatest businesspeople, most of them, in order to pare debt or change a company or change a structure, most of them and many of them and some — the best ones, and I name some of ‘em. I could name 25 more… Donald Trump’s Net Worth- Disputed! Claims about Donald Trump’s net worth remain disputed. Trump himself says that he’s worth more than $9 billion, but Forbes has estimated that Trump is worth about $4 billion. Forbes describes the discrepancy: The major difference: his brand. Trump claims that his brand and brand-related deals are worth some $3.3 billion. We value his brand at just $125 million; we give him another $128 million in management fees for Trump-branded hotels. Another major discrepancy is golf courses: Trump has been advocating for a valuation for his chain of American golf courses as high as $800 million. Independent valuation experts tell us our figure of $200 million is much closer to the mark. The other difference is properties under development. Trump claims nearly $300 million here; we don’t give properties full build-out value until they’re actually fully built and running. Trump’s actual net worth is disputed because of the value he places a higher value on the Trump brand than others have. You would have sell off all his assets to find Trump’s actual net worth. Trump Once Proposed a 14% tax on Americans Worth $10 million – Truth! This one is true. In 1999, as a possible candidate for the Reform Party, Donald Trump laid out a plan to levy a one-time 14.25% tax on every American worth more than $10 million. That would have generated $5.7 trillion, enough to wipe out the national debt in 1999, CNN reports : The net worth tax is the cornerstone of Trump’s economic plan released Tuesday morning. “No one has put forward a plan to make this country entirely debt free as we enter the next millennium,” Trump said in a written statement. “The plan I am proposing today does not involve smoke and mirrors, phony numbers, financial gimmicks, or the usual economic chicanery you usually find in Disneyland-on-the-Potomac,” Trump said. Trump would exempt the value of an individual’s principal home from the net worth total. “By my calculations, 1 percent of Americans, who control 90 percent of the wealth in this country, would be affected by my plan,” Trump said. “The other 99 percent of the people would get deep reductions in their federal income taxes,” he said. Donald Trump Switched from Pro-Choice to Pro-Life- Reported as Truth! Donald Trump has publicly flip-flopped positions on abortion, but he has implied that he was secretly pro-life all along. Trump described himself as pro-choice during a 1999 appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” : “Look, I’m very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject, but you still — I just believe in choice … I am strongly for choice, and yet I hate the concept of abortion. I am pro-choice in ever respect, but I just hate it.” He made similar comments that year on Fox News as he considered a presidential run on the Reform Party ticket. Also, in 1989, Trump co-sponsored a dinner to honor the leader of the National Abortion Rights Action League but did not attend the event, the National Journal reports . However, during the first Republican presidential debate in 2015, Trump said he was pro-life. He alluded to the idea that he’d previously described himself as pro-choice because of business relationships he had at the time. Supports Full Drug Legalization to Generate Taxes for Education- Truth! & Outdated! It’s true that Donald Trump once called for the legalization of drugs, but, again, he has changed his position on the issue over the decades. Trump first made the comment about drug legalization in 1990, the Miami Herald reports : Billionaire New York developer Donald Trump said the nation’s drug enforcement effort is “a joke” and repeated his call for the legalization of drugs Friday during a luncheon held by the Miami Herald . “We’re losing badly the war on drugs,” Trump said. “You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from drug czars.” Tax revenues from a legalized drug trade could be spent to educate the public on the dangers of drugs, Trump said during a speech at the newspaper’s Company of the Year Awards luncheon. By 2015, Trump had backed off that position. In an address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump said that he didn’t even support legalization of pot. ","Politics"
"John Kerry’s Daughter Married an Iranian with Connections to Nuclear Negotiators- Fiction!","2015-08-04 15:30:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/john-kerrys-daughter-married-an-iranian-with-connections-to-nuclear-negotiators/"," Secretary of State John Kerry’s daughter married an Iranian man with connections to an Iranian foreign minister who participated in nuclear negotiations. "," Parts of this rumor are true, but they have been twisted into a false narrative. Tidbits from various reports have been used to make a number of claims about John Kerry’s ties to Iranian nuclear negotiators. These reports argue that Kerry should have recused himself from nuclear talks with Iran because of conflicts of interest. Let’s take a look at claims that have frequently appeared: John Kerry’s Daughter Married an Iranian- Mostly Fiction! John Kerry’s daughter married a man of Iranian descent, but he was born and raised in America. Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Vanessa was practicing internal medicine there, and Nahed was practicing neurological surgery, according to a New York Times wedding announcement : The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom’s mother. Nahed was born in New York, according to his Mass General bio . John Kerry Concealed His Son-in-Law’s Iranian Bloodlines- Mostly Fiction! This one is mostly fiction. John Kerry acknowledged his family’s connection to Iran in a statement that was released on the Iranian New Year in March 2013: It’s a privilege to join President Obama in sending warm wishes for health and prosperity to the people of Iran and all those who celebrate Nowruz around the world. As you gather with your loved ones around the Sofreh Haft-Seen, we are proud to note that many Americans will join you in celebrating Nowruz. This year, we are once again reminded of the outstanding contributions of Iranian-Americans and Iranian students here in the United States, which reflect the rich history of your culture. I am proud of the Iranian-Americans in my own family, and grateful for how they have enriched my life. Kerry made the admission after a website operated by the Iranian government reported that his son-in-law was an Iranian-American and had still relatives in Iran. The report was published as Kerry faced a Senate confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, so it wasn’t a “secret.” Kenneth Timmerman, president of the Foundation for Democracy in Iran, described the timing of Kerry’s statement in a column that appeared in the Daily Caller : Was the Iranian publication itself a subtle form of blackmail, aimed at letting Kerry know that the regime is fully aware of his son-in-law’s extended family in Iran? The Islamic Republic systematically puts pressure on family members of prominent Iranian-Americans (for example, individuals who work at the Persian service of Voice of America), to make sure that they do not engage in hostile statements or activities against the Tehran regime. Certainly, Secretary Kerry has long favored a U.S. rapprochement with the Islamic Republic. He has repeatedly appeared with groups such as the American Iranian Council (AIC), and has taken money from Iranian-Americans for his political campaigns, including at least one illegal donation from an Iranian woman who did not have a green card. So he didn’t need to have an Iranian-American family member to believe that the United States should forge direct relations with the Islamic Republic or ease U.S. pressure on the regime. Kerry may have figured that by revealing the family tie himself he could diffuse the situation, and make it more difficult for the regime to put pressure on his son-in-law’s family. Of course, that’s assuming Kerry in fact plans to do anything that angers the regime. Besides, the New York Times ran a wedding announcement in 2009 that quoted Kerry, so it wouldn’t have been a very well guarded secret. The Son of an Iranian Foreign Minister Was the Best Man in John Kerry’s Daughter’s Wedding- Reported as Fiction! There’s no proof that this one is true. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The rumor that Zarif’s son was the best man in Kerry’s daughter’s wedding started with a post on Allen B. West’s website in July 2015: Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry’s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif’s son. The story doesn’t cite a source, but Vanessa Kerry Nahed quickly shot the rumor down. She tweeted that her husband didn’t have a best man because they didn’t have a bridal party at their wedding. An Iranian news agency called the report a “news fabrication” and said Zarif’s son wasn’t at the wedding. According to the report : Officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry’s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif’s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed’s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry’s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning. It is true, however, that Kerry has a personal relationship with Zarif that predates the nuclear talks. The diplomats’ relationship was reported in a 2012 book by author Hooman Majd . ","Politics"
"Confederate Soldiers Are Considered U.S. Veterans Under Federal Law-Truth!","2015-07-23 07:51:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/confederate-soldiers-are-considered-u-s-veterans-under-federal-law/"," Confederate soldiers are officially considered American veterans and have the same protections as Union soldiers because of an act of Congress called Public Law 810 and other federal laws. "," It’s true that Union and Confederate soldiers are considered U.S. veterans under federal law, and that they would be entitled to the same benefits as Union soldiers today. These claims went viral on social media after the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina Capitol grounds in July 2015. The state legislature voted to remove the flag after a self-described white supremacist murdered nine black churchgoers there. That inspired posts on social media sites that claimed Confederate and Union veterans were considered equals under federal law, and that they are entitled to the same protections and benefits. It’s true that a federal law passed in 1958 listed the spouses and children of all Civil War veterans — Confederate and Union — as eligible for federal pensions: Whenever there is no surviving spouse entitled to pension under section 1532 of this title, the Secretary shall pay to the children of each Civil War veteran who met the service requirements of section 1532 of this title a pension at the monthly rate of $73.13 for one child, plus $8.13 for each additional child, with the total amount equally divided. It’s also true that federal law (formerly Public Law 810) makes Confederate soldiers eligible for burial in national cemeteries and for taxpayer-funded headstones, just like Union soldiers: The Secretary shall furnish, when requested, an appropriate memorial headstone or marker for the purpose of commemorating an eligible individual whose remains are unavailable. Such a headstone or marker shall be furnished for placement in a national cemetery area reserved for that purpose under section 2403 of this title, a veterans’ cemetery owned by a State, or, in the case of a veteran, in a State, local, or private cemetery. The last known Civil War veteran died in 1956, and the last known widow of a Civil War veteran died in 2003 at age 93. But there were surprisingly two children of Civil War veterans who were still receiving benefits in 2012, U.S. News reports : In the 19th and early 20th centuries, only Union soldiers were eligible for military benefits. It wasn’t until the 1930s that confederate soldiers began receiving pensions from the federal government. Prior to that, confederate soldiers could apply for benefits through the state they resided in. The groundwork for reconciliation, however, was laid decades before Confederate soldiers and family members became available for federal benefits. President William McKinley cited reconciliation between the North and South in a speech that followed the conclusion of the Spanish American War on December 14, 1898. A number of former Confederate officers had volunteered for service during the war, which had helped secure U.S. victory, McKinley said: … Every soldier’s grave made during our unfortunate Civil War is a tribute to American valor. And while, when those graves were made, we differed widely about the future of this government, those differences were long ago settled by the arbitrament of arms; and the time has now come, in the evolution of sentiment and feeling under the providence of God, when in the spirit of fraternity we should share with you in the care of the graves of the Confederate soldiers. The Cordial feeling now happily existing between the North and South prompts this gracious act, and if it needed further justification, it is found in the gallant loyalty to the Union and the flag so conspicuously shown in the year just past by the sons and grandsons of these (Spanish American War veterans). What a glorious future awaits us if united, wisely, and bravely we face the new problems now pressing upon us, determined to solve them for right and humanity. That flag has been planted in two hemispheres, and there it remains the symbol of liberty and law, of peace and progress. Who will withdraw from the people over whom it floats its protecting folds? Who will haul it down? Answer me, ye men of the South, who is there in Dixie who will haul it down? McKinley called for federal recognition of Union and Confederate soldiers because he viewed them all as Americans. But the Confederate flag wasn’t a part of McKinley’s reconciliation efforts, and he specifically cites the flying of the American flag in the south as reason to move forward with federal recognition of Confederate soldiers. The Confederate flag didn’t fly widely in the south until the 1940s, the Atlantic reports: After the surrender in 1865, Confederate flags were folded and put away. They were most likely to be spotted at memorials or cemeteries. Even after the hopeful decade of Reconstruction gave way to the violent repression of Redemption, open displays of the flag remained rare. There was no need for a banner to signal defiance; Jim Crow reigned unchallenged. The flag slowly crept back into public life over the ensuing decades, saluted at veterans’ reunions, promoted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, even carried into battle by units from the South. By the mid-twentieth century, the flags were also waved by football fans, and sold to tourists. But as a political symbol, the flag was revived when northern Democrats began to press for an end to the South’s system of racial oppression. In 1948, the Dixiecrats revolted against President Harry Truman—who had desegregated the armed forces and supported anti-lynching bills. The movement began in Mississippi in February of 1948, with thousands of activists “shouting rebel yells and waving the Confederate flag,” as the Associated Press reported at the time. Some actually removed old, mothballed flags from the trunks where they had until then been gathering dust. So, it’s true that Confederate and Union soldiers are considered equal under federal law, but critics argue that the same isn’t true of the American and Confederate flags. ","Politics"
"The True Military Record of John McCain-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-07-23 07:48:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-true-military-record-of-john-mccain/"," A viral email that claims to tell about “the true military record of John McCain” argues that the Arizona senator isn’t a true war hero. "," Claims about John McCain’s fall can be classified as “all of the above.” They’re true, false and unproven. Many of these claims surfaced during the 2008 presidential election. Then, the rumors resurfaced in July 2015 after Donald Trump, a 2016 presidential contender, said McCain was only considered a war hero because he had been captured during the Vietnam War. That idea first appeared in a blog post titled, “The True Military Record of John McCain, Written By an Active Marine” in 2008. But the so-called “active Marine” that penned the blog is unnamed, so we can’t verify its authorship. Everyone’s definition of a “war hero” varies, but the blog post makes a number of direct accusations about McCain’s war record that can be fact checked and verified: McCain Became Squadron Commander Because of Family Connections- Fiction! It’s not true that John McCain was “promoted to squadron commander of the airfield named after his own grandfather immediately after crashing his third airplane.” McCain was promoted to squadron commander at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1976 — after he spent five years in captivity at the “Hanoi Hilton” in North Vietnam. Also, the crash in North Vietnam was his fifth crash as an airman, not his third. The claim that Cecil Airfield was named after his grandfather is also false. McCain’s paternal grandfather’s name was John McCain Sr ., and his maternal grandfather was named Archie Wright . However, McCain’s father and grandfather were both decorated airmen. McCain Was Awarded 28 Medals After Spending 20 Hours in Combat- Unproven! & Fiction! There’s no record of exactly how many hours McCain spent flying combat missions in the Vietnam War. He was, however, shot down and captured while flying his 23rd combat mission on October 26, 1967. Also, the Navy unsealed John McCain’s military record in 2008, and it revealed that he had received 17 awards and decorations during his career — not 28, as the eRumor claims: McCain attended the U.S. Naval Academy from 1954 to 1958, and was commissioned as an ensign in June of that year. He retired in April 1981 with the rank of captain. In that time he received 17 awards and decorations. Besides the Silver Star Medal, McCain also received the Legion of Merit with a combat “V” and one gold star, a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Bronze Star Medal with a combat “V” and two gold stars. Several citations mention his achievements either as a prisoner or as a lieutenant commander flying bombing runs off the deck of the USS Oriskany. Some are signed by then-Secretary of the Navy John Warner, who would become a colleague of McCain’s in the Senate. The citation for his Distinguished Flying Cross sums up McCain’s misfortune the following day: “Although his aircraft was severely damaged, he continued his bomb delivery pass and released his bombs on the target. When the aircraft would not recover from the dive, Commander McCain was forced to eject over the target.” Years later, as his Navy career approached its end, McCain received the Legion of Merit Medal. By then, his missions were in the halls of Congress as a liaison to the Senate from the Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs. He was praised for providing Navy leaders “with sage advice and sound judgment for enacting critical legislation during a period of severe fiscal constraint.” McCain Finished Near the Bottom of His Class at the U.S. Naval Academy- Truth! It’s true that John McCain graduated near the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. Some reports say that he graduated 790th out of 795 students. McCain alluded to his academic record there during a commencement speech in 1997: This is quite an unexpected honor for a Naval Academy midshipman who graduated fifth from the bottom in the Class of ’58. All those years ago, when I was a midshipman, I indulged in the normal daydreams of a young man about what kind of honors awaited me later in life. These rumors about John McCain’s military records aren’t likely to go away anytime soon, but some have persisted for years even though they can easily be proven false. ","Politics"

I’ve said if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.” A representative for Trump later told the Associated Press that the real estate mogul “was absolutely joking” and had attempted to poke fun at himself for dating younger women.

"," There haven’t been any confirmed cases of Christian couples filing for divorce to protest the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage. That report was started by United Media Publishing , a website that publishes a combination of real and fake news. After the Supreme Court ruled that bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional, the website (falsely) reported : Thousands of Christian couples, some who have been married for decades, have vowed to file for divorce in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling which has legalized gay marriage nationwide. Adam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. “We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs.” Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. “I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. It’s unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satan’s agenda.” The story was quickly shared more than 56,000 times on social media sites. Many believed it to be true, but a closer look reveals a number of false claims. First, there’s no record of group called “Christ in Family Services” located in Topeka, Kansas. The group also doesn’t have an online footprint outside of the United Media Publishing report. The report also cites a so-called employee of “Calvin and Hays Family Court” in San Diego, which doesn’t exist. All divorce proceedings in the San Diego area go through the San Diego County Family Law Courthouse . At least one coupled did, however, actually threaten to divorce in protest of a gay marriage ruling. Nick and Sarah Jensen, high school sweethearts from Australia who had been married for 10 years, grabbed headlines when they made that threat in June 2015. But the Jensens threatened to divorce if gay marriage became legal in Australia — not the U.S. Besides, it was later reported that Australia’s Family Law Act would make it difficult for Nick and Sarah Jensen to symbolically divorce. The law requires couples to live separately for at least 12 months before a divorce is granted. So far, there haven’t been any confirmed cases of Christian couples actually divorcing in protest of the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. ","Politics"

"," President Obama didn’t sign an executive order that bans the Confederate flag. The website Real News, Right Now falsely reported that President Obama’s executive order would make it illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess Confederate flags: WASHINGTON, D.C. – During a White House-hosted dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan Monday evening, President Obama, flanked by select cabinet members, announced he has signed into law an executive order banning the manufacturing, distribution, and possession of Confederate flags and other memorabilia. “When our values are threatened, we come together as one nation,” Mr. Obama said. “As Americans, we insist that nobody should be targeted because of who they are, or what they look like, who they love, how they worship. We stand united against these hateful acts.” The executive order is the 209th issued by President Obama since taking office and is being hailed as a major victory against racism. Based largely on Germany’s anti-Nazi laws, the order, which officially goes into effect on June 18th, makes it illegal to possess “any item or symbol bearing the sign of the Confederacy.” President Obama, calling the Confederate flag a “symbol of hatred,” compared its history to that off the Third Reich, saying, “You don’t see government buildings in Germany flying the Nazi flag, we shouldn’t have to see the Confederate flag here.” The article also (falsely) reported that President Obama’s executive order would make possession of a Confederate flag a federal hate crime, and that South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had ordered the immediate removal of the Confederate flag from the state building to comply with the new federal law. According to the Federal Register , President Obama has signed no such executive order. And Nikki Haley has called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capitol building in South Carolina, but she didn’t order its immediate removal to comply with federal law.

"Bill Clinton Used Confederate Buttons in 1992 Presidential Campaign- Fiction!","2015-06-24 11:41:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-used-confederate-buttons-in-1992-presidential-campaign/"," Bill Clinton and Al Gore used Confederate flag buttons during the 1992 presidential campaign. "," Bill Clinton and Al Gore do appear on Confederate flag buttons from the 1992 presidential campaign, but the campaign denies that it approved or printed them. Photos of two Confederate flag-themed buttons went viral after Dylann Roof, a self-described white supremacist, murdered nine black people who had gathered for bible study at the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina. That led to calls for South Carolina and other states to remove the Confederate flag from capitol grounds — and the so-called Bill Clinton Confederate flag campaign button surfaced during the debate. There’s no doubt that the buttons are real, but a former Clinton staffer says the campaign didn’t make them. On one button, Bill Clinton and Al Gore’s faces have been pasted onto the bodies of Confederate soldiers, and the phrase, “Sons of the New South,” is printed over the Confederate flag. On another button, “Clinton-Gore” is printed across the Confederate flag, and “1992” appears at the bottom. Arguements that Bill Clinton’s staff didn’t make the buttons center on union stamps that appear on most official campaign merchandise from 1992. Most Clinton buttons are stamped with a small logo (or bug) that says it was made in a union shop, but the stamp doesn’t appear on the Confederate flag buttons. Craig Smith, a former Clinton staffer, made that argument in a statement to CBS News. Smith, who oversaw state operations in the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, said he had never seen or approved the buttons: “If it didn’t have a union bug, we weren’t making them,” he said, “and we definitely weren’t handing them out.” The button in question, and others featuring similar designs for sale or sold on eBay, does not show any indication of being union-made. Smith added that individual states were given their own, small budget for “discretionary items” like state-specific merchandise. But those items had to include the state’s name and follow the same production guidelines as items made for national distribution. “It would have been in violation of multiple campaign policies,” he said of a state producing a button like the ones sold online. “I just don’t think they did it.” Smith said he thought the buttons were likely made by someone unaffiliated with the campaign looking to make a buck. He said if it had been pitched to him, it wouldn’t have gotten past his desk. “Not appropriate then,” he said, “and not appropriate now.” Also, unauthorized presidential buttons are fairly common. For example, one button from Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign reads, “Deadheads Support Hillary in 2008.” It’s highly unlikely that Hillary Clinton’s staff printed or approved that button. Because the Confederate flag buttons don’t have the union bugs, and because it’s easy to print unofficial merchandise, we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","Politics"

The Huffington Post dug up an excerpt from a chapter called “The Restoration of Shame:” “One of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior, no reason to feel shame. Many of these young women and young men look around and see their friends engaged in the same irresponsible conduct. Their parents and neighbors have become ineffective at attaching some sense of ridicule to this behavior. There was a time when neighbors and communities would frown on out of wedlock births and when public condemnation was enough of a stimulus for one to be careful.” Jeb Bush says that not “attaching some sense of ridicule” to out-of-wedlock births has led to more of them, which implies his support for it. But during a campaign stop in Iowa, Bush denied that he supported single mothers being shamed: “I’m not in favor of shaming women. What I’m in favor of is shaming men who abandon their children. Women who bring up children by themselves do it heroically, they do it against all odds. Men who don’t feel responsible for being part of their child’s life create real strains on that family.” But Jeb Bush’s original comments were directed toward single mothers and single fathers. He didn’t make it clear that only single fathers should be shamed for out-of-wedlock births at the time. That’s why we’re reporting this one as truth. ","Politics"
"Charlie Daniels Pens Open Letter to President Obama-Authorship Confirmed!","2015-06-19 14:17:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/charlie-daniels-pens-open-letter-to-president-obama/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Charlie Daniels Pens Open Letter to President Obama- Authorship Confirmed! Summar of eRumor: Charlie Daniels wrote a scathing open letter to President Obama that has gone viral. "," This one is true. Charlie Daniels wrote an open letter to President Obama that appeared on the musician’s official website on June 8, 2015. In the letter, Daniels says that Obama has little faith in American ingenuity, American capability, American exceptionalism and American patriotism. It continues: “You seem to think that America needs a monolithic, big brother type government to oversee and regulate every aspect of American life, that citizens are not competent to control their own affairs and make their own decisions without some oppressive bureaucracy to call the shots. Mr. President, the answer is not government, conversely, the problem is government. A government that has doubled the national debt, increased unemployment, lowered take home pay, increased food stamp participation and disability claims and introduced socialized medicine. You support teacher’s unions which take political activism more seriously than education. You intentionally lied to the American people about your stand on marriage being between a man and woman, and continue to lie when it is politically expedient for you to do so. You surround yourself with inexperienced ideologues and political yes men and take the advice of individuals who are swimming in waters way too deep for them. Your petulance is unbecoming, Mr. President, and your criticism of anyone who disagrees with you is downright unmanly. You come off like a spoiled child who has been denied his way.” This isn’t the first time that Charlie Daniels took a public political stand, either. Daniels blasted “the Hollywood bunch” that didn’t support the war in Iraq in 2003. In that open letter , Daniels wrote: “Ok, let’s just say for a moment you bunch of pampered, overpaid, unrealistic children had your way and the U.S.A. didn’t go into Iraq. Let’s say that you really get your way and we destroy all our nuclear weapons and stick daisies in our gun barrels and sit around with some white wine and cheese and pat ourselves on the back, so proud of what we’ve done for world peace. Let’s say that we cut the military budget to just enough to keep the National Guard on hand to help out with floods and fires. Let’s say that we close down our military bases all over the world and bring the troops home, increase our foreign aid and drop all the trade sanctions against everybody. I suppose that in your fantasy world this would create a utopian world where everybody would live in peace. After all, the great monster, the United States of America, the cause of all the world’s trouble would have disbanded it’s horrible military and certainly all the other countries of the world would follow suit. After all, they only arm themselves to defend their countries from the mean old U.S.A. Why you bunch of pitiful, hypocritical, idiotic, spoiled mugwumps. Get your head out of the sand and smell the Trade Towers burning. Do you think that a trip to Iraq by Sean Penn did anything but encourage a wanton murderer to think that the people of the U.S.A. didn’t have the nerve or the guts to fight him? Barbara Streisand’s fanatical and hateful rankings about George Bush make about as much sense as Michael Jackson hanging a baby over a railing. You people need to get out of Hollywood once in a while and get out into the real world. You¹d be surprised at the hostility you would find out here.” ","Politics"
"Ann Coulter Suggests Denying Citizenship to Blind, Disabled Immigrants-Truth!","2015-06-19 13:49:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ann-coulter-suggests-denying-citizenship-to-blind-disabled-immigrants/"," Ann Coulter, a conservative commentator and author, said immigrants who are blind or are in wheelchairs should not be granted citizenship. "," This one is true. Ann Coulter made the remarks during a June 2015 appearance on the Simon Conway Show, a syndicated talk radio program. Coulter was talking about the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) waiving citizenship requirements when she said : “The INS is waiving many English-language requirements for immigrants. And that obviously goes to the heart of it: Are you switching allegiances? Do you love this country? Beyond that, how about the wheelchair only section, how about the section for the blind? Look, we wish these people well, but we’re not running a charity here. It’s insane for any country not to be using its immigration policies to bring in people who are better than us, not people who are going to immediately need taxpayer assistance. We already have our own poor people. And, again, this includes all the immigrants who have come in forever and are here now. It’s people who live in America we should be taking care of, not bringing in people we have to help.” It’s not clear what Ann Coulter is referencing when she talks about a “wheelchair only section” and a “section for the blind.” But, in the past, immigrants who were unable to complete a naturalization interview, a naturalization test and take an oath of allegiance due to a physical disability were unable to be become naturalized citizens. That policy came to light during the 1990s. A 25-year-old immigrant from India who had lived in the U.S. since she was a baby was denied citizenship because she had cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and other illnesses that made it impossible for her to recite the oath of allegiance. President Clinton signed a bipartisan bill into law in 2000 that granted a waiver to immigrants who qualified for citizenship but were unable to complete the process because of a disability.

"Colin Powell Says There Is Still Racism and Intolerance in the GOP-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-06-19 13:43:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/colin-powell-says-there-is-still-racism-and-intolerance-in-the-gop/"," Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that racism and intolerance still exists within the Republican Party, and in some parts of the country. "," Colin Powell has talked about “a dark vein of intolerance” in some wings of the Republican Party, but he has never publicly called them “racists.” Following the 2012 presidential election, Colin Powell said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the Republican Party was having “an identity problem” and had to better reflect the country’s changing demographics to win a national election. Powell also said there was a “dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party.” Here’s a transcript of Powell’s remarks: “I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns. I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark — a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents. Then, in March 2015, Colin Powell once again drew headlines when he said that he still saw a “dark vein of intolerance” along the political spectrum, including Republicans, during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.”  When asked about his previous comments, Powell responded : “I still see (the dark vein of intolerance). I still see it in the Republican Party and I still see it in other parts of our country. You don’t have to be a Republican — a Republican to be touched by this dark vein. America is still going through this transformation from where we were just 50 of 60 years ago. You have to remember, it was only about 60 or 70 years ago that we stood have — still had poll taxes, that we still had literacy tests in order to vote, that the voting places were only open two days a month for African-Americans. So we’ve come a long way, but there’s a long way to go. And we have to change the hearts and minds of Americans. And I see progress, especially in the younger generation. When I speak to young kids, when I look at my own young grandchildren, they’re not of that past, they’re of the present. They’re of the future. They understand the importance of diversity. They understand the beauty of this wonderful country of ours, with all the different shades of people we have in this country. So we have to deal with this. We have to deal with making sure that everybody can vote and express their opinion, police forces are acting in a proper manner, citizens are acting in a proper manner with respect to the police forces and that governments and cities and states throughout the — throughout the country are making sure that they are not discriminating against any particular part of their citizenry.” So, again, Colin Powell described the nation’s changing demographics and talked generally about a dark vein of intolerance. However, Powell didn’t use the term “racists,” as the eRumor alleges. That comment appears to have came from Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell’s former chief of staff. In an April 2015 interview with Salon, Wilkerson said: “There are sane and sober people in the Republican Party. The public persona of the Republican Party has changed since the days of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower. I’m not afraid of a backlash. The GOP has scores of racists. Under Richard Nixon’s blessing, the GOP took advantage of disgruntled Democrats in the South. They are still there and their children are there. This is very much known in our party. This was a conscious strategy.” Colin Powell has talked generally about intolerance and the Republican Party’s need to appeal to the country’s changing demographics, but it’s not true that he called Republicans racist. It appears that Lawrence Wilkerson’s comments were incorrectly attributed to Powell, or that the term “racists” was added in the retelling of his comments. ","Politics"
"John Kerry Was Injured in Assassination Attempt, Not Bike Accident-Reported as Fiction!","2015-06-11 18:19:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/john-kerry-was-injured-in-assassination-attempt-not-bike-accident/"," Secretary of State John Kerry was gravely injured in an attempted assassination during a meeting with members of ISIS, not in a bike accident in France. "," : John Kerry wasn’t wounded in an attempted ISIS assassination. That claim went viral after John Kerry reportedly broke his leg near the border of Switzerland and France in June 2015. The Wall Street Journal reports that Kerry, who usually takes a bike with him on overseas trips, fractured his femur in an early morning crash: “The accident comes at an crucial moment in the Obama administration’s long-running push to reach a final nuclear agreement with Iran. Mr. Kerry has made the Iran talks a personal priority, taking the U.S. lead on the negotiations.” Shortly after the crash, the Israel-based newspaper the Jerusalem Post reported that Iranian media had “erupted” with “unsubstantiated” rumors that John Kerry had been targeted and injured by ISIS assassins: “The latest Iranian report, first published by the Nasim news agency and subsequently picked up by dozens of Iranian news sites, based its information on “an American news website” which cites a Russian foreign intelligence service report as the source of the information. According to the report in Nasim , Kerry secretly met with one of the leaders of Islamic State on Sunday. The meeting eventually led to an armed clash and an attempt to assassinate the US secretary of state. Kerry’s meeting, in which the alleged assassination attempt took place, was with Gulmurod Khalimov, a senior Tajik police commander, trained in the United States, who announced his defection to Islamic State in a video released last week, the report states. Having received training from the US State Department previously, Khalimov was well aware of State Department security procedures and he used the knowledge to get another member of his entourage into the secret meeting with Kerry, with the intention of assassinating him, the report claims. The report cited communications intercepted by Russian intelligence from France, the US and Switzerland as confirming that two other people were shot in the incident, one of them fatally. The story of Kerry breaking his femur in a bicycle accident in Switzerland was then concocted to hide the real source of his ‘grave injuries,’ according to the report.” The Jerusalem Post report, which didn’t provide a link to the Nasim news agency story it had cited, quickly went viral. Other news sites repeated the Jerusalem Post’s account without citing the original Iranian news stories that had “erupted” with the conspiracy theory. There’s no sign of John Kerry’s attempted assassination on leading Iranian news sites like Iran Daily , Tehran Times and Nasim news agency. Those sites may have deleted the story and scrubbed away all traces of its existence, or it may have never appeared in Iranian news at all. The State Department released a photo of John Kerry resting in Boston hospital with his right leg extended days after the conspiracy theory went viral. The photo seems to dispel rumors that Kerry had been “gravely injured” or was on the verge of death. ","Politics"
"President Obama Announces Plans to Pay Reparations for Slavery-Reported as Fiction!","2015-06-10 11:34:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-announces-plans-to-pay-reparations-for-slavery/"," Reports have gone viral that President Obama has announced plans to pay black people reparations for slavery. "," There’s no truth to reports that President Obama has announced plans to pay black people reparations for slavery. The rumor started in April 2015 when Charles Payne, the host of the Fox Business Network show “Making Money” predicted that President Obama would push forward plans to pay reparations for slavery. Charles Payne’s prediction came after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel backed a proposal to pay $5.5 million in reparations to victims of Jon Burge, a former Chicago police commissioner who was convicted of torture in federal court. The Chicago Tribune reports : “The proposal, negotiated with a key plaintiff’s attorney and supported by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, would offer free city college tuition for victims and their families, free counseling for psychological issues and substance abuse as well as other assistance to more than 50 potential victims. The city would also issue a formal apology, create a permanent memorial recognizing the victims and ensure that eighth- and 10th-grade students attending Chicago Public Schools would be taught about the Burge case and its brutal legacy, cementing the scandal’s role in city history.” Following news of Chicago’s plans for reparations, Charles Payne predicted that federal reparations for slavery would be next on the docket: “The news in my mind is a glimpse of really much bigger news that is going to come from the White House. I think that there’s going to be an official apology from the White House for slavery in America and then there’s going to be a major push to get cash. And I’m talking lots of cash. I actually think it would be a major mistake. Instead, Obama should really discuss and focus on all of the progress we have made and how all Americans need to move forward for better days for all of our kids.” After the story went viral in April 2015, it re-surfaced again in June 2015 when the website American News re-posted a story from April 2015 on its Facebook page with the message, “BREAKING: Obama Just Announced That He Will Be Forcing To Compensate Black For Slavery.” The post also said: “Obama pushes reparation for slavery on all non-black Americans. Slavery is over and has been over for hundreds of year. Do you think we should have to compensate blacks for slavery?” As Charles Payne’s comments have been recycled across the web, the fact that he was expressing his personal opinion and not reporting fact-based news was quickly lost. Soon, readers commented on the story as though President Obama had actually taken steps to approve reparations. One reader commented : “I have never owned slaves! Why should my tax dollars go to compensate blacks for slavery? On the other hand, not one single black living today was a victim of the acts of slavery present in the past history of the United States. So, someone please explain to me why they should receive reparations.” The legislature has introduced various bills that would explore reparations over the years, but President Obama has not been personally involved with any of them. In 2013, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) introduced a bill that would establish a commission to study reparation proposals for African-Americans. The bill was referred to a committee and no action has been taken on it since. As for President Obama, he was asked about his views on reparations in a debate during the 2008 presidential election. The president responded : “I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools. …I did aa town hall meeting in Florence, South Carolina, in an area called the corridor of shame. They’ve got buildings that students are trying to learn in that were built right after the Civil War. And we’ve got teachers who are not trained to teach the subjects they’re teaching and high dropout rates. We’ve got to understand that there are corridors of shame all across the country. And if we make the investments and understand that those are our children, that’s the kind of reparations that are really going to make a difference in America right now.” ","Politics"

"," The Baltimore Sun didn’t publish “The Black Dilemma” editorial. The editorial was published in September 2014 by American Renaissance , a website that says it approaches “the problems of race” with “race realism.” Anthony Bryan, described as an engineer and entrepreneur who lives in Whitetopia, wrote the editorial , which is actually called “Ten Percent is Not Enough.” The editorial begins with the line, “The black/white experiment has failed,” and it continues: “For almost 150 years the United States has been conducting an experiment. The subjects of the experiment: black people and working-class whites. The hypothesis to be tested: Can a people taken from the jungles of Africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population? The whites were descendants of Europeans who had created a majestic civilization. The former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements. Acting on a policy that was not fair to either group, the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors. America has struggled with racial discord ever since. Decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up. They insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work, and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted. They created the Freedman’s Bureau, passed civil rights laws, tried to build the Great Society, declared War on Poverty, ordered race preferences, built housing projects, and tried midnight basketball. Their new laws intruded into people’s lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable. They called in National Guard troops to enforce school integration. They outlawed freedom of association. Over the protests of parents, they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa. They tried with money, special programs, relaxed standards, and endless handwringing to close the ‘achievement gap.’ To keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race. They hung up Orwellian public banners that commanded whites to ‘Celebrate Diversity!’ and ‘Say No To Racism.’ Nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment. In June 2015, the editorial began to circulate via forwarded emails and online forums under the new headline, “The Black Dilemma.” The new version of the editorial was incorrectly attributed to the Baltimore Sun .

"," It’s true that Hillary Clinton said she “admires” Margaret Sanger. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America gave the Margaret Sanger Award to Hillary Clinton for her “contributions to the advancement of women’s heath care.” During her acceptance speech, Clinton said : “It was a great privilege when I was told that I would receive this award. I admire Margaret Sanger enormously.

U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.) said “the poor, disenfranchised, weak, disabled, a person of color (and) an unborn child are among the so-called undesirables that Sanger would exterminate from the human race.” Clinton responded : “I admire Thomas Jefferson, his words and his leadership — and I deplore his un-repentant slave holding. I admire Margaret Sanger being a pioneer and trying to empower women to have some control over their bodies — and I deplore the statements you have referenced.

"Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Was Motivated by Racism-Reported to be Fiction!","2015-06-10 11:22:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/planned-parenthoods-margaret-sanger-was-motivated-by-racism/"," Claims have been made that Margaret Sanger, the founder of organizations that eventually became Planned Parenthood, encouraged “colored people” to use birth control because she was racist and wanted to use eugenics to eliminate the race. "," : Many quotations about black people and birth control have been falsely attributed to Margaret Sanger over the years, so we are reporting this one to be fiction. Most of them stem from “the Negro Project,” which Margaret Sanger launched in 1938 to educate black people about birth control. Claims that Sanger was motivated by racism first surfaced in the 1970s when author Linda Gordon made that argument in her book, “ Woman’s Body, Woman’s Right .” In the book, Gordon quoted Sanger as stating that: “The mass of significant Negroes, particularly in the South, still breed carelessly and disastrously, with the result that the increase among Negroes, even more than among whites, is (in) that portion of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear children properly.” But that statement actually came from the civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois. It was included in an article that he wrote for the Birth Control Review in 1932 titled “Negroes and Birth Control.” Margaret Sanger later quoted Du Bois, but the statement wasn’t her own. Another common claim is that Margaret Sanger called black people “human weeds” and reckless breeders who never should have been born in her book, “ Pivot of Civilization .” That claim appears to have started with a post published by the website Life News: “In ‘Pivot of Civilization,’ Sanger penned her thoughts regarding immigrants, the poor, and the error of philanthropy. Sanger’s ideology of racial and social hygiene bleeds through her writings on breeding an ideal human race: They are…human weeds,’ ‘reckless breeders,’ ’spawning… human beings who never should have been born.” But the phrases “human weeds” and “never should have been born” don’t appear in Margaret Sanger’s “Pivot of Civilization.” Sanger does quote Karl Marx on “reckless breeding” at one point: “…This is nowhere more evident than in Marx’s ‘Capital’ itself. In that monumental effort, it is impossible to discover any adequate refutation or even calm discussion of the dangers of irresponsible parenthood and reckless breeding, any suspicion that this recklessness and irresponsibility is even remotely related to the miseries of the proletariat.” So, again, it appears that these quotes have been taken out of context or incorrectly attributed to Margaret Sanger. The idea that Margaret Sanger was motivated by racism is also contradicted by the civil rights movement’s acceptance of her birth control education campaign. In 1966, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Margaret Sanger Award in Human Rights, he said : “There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger’s early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist — a nonviolent resistor. She was willing to accept scorn and abuse until the truth she saw was revealed to the millions. At the turn of the century she went into the slums and set up a birth control clinic, and for this deed she went to jail because she was violating an unjust law. Yet the years have justified her actions. She launched a movement which is obeying a higher law to preserve human life under humane conditions. Margaret Sanger had to commit what was then called a crime in order to enrich humanity, and today we honor her courage and vision; for without them there would have been no beginning.” Margaret Sanger has always been a polarizing figure, and that’s unlikely to change. However, historical records don’t back up claims that she was motivated by racism, so we are reporting this one as fiction. ","Politics"

According to the bill: “This bill prohibits the performance of an abortion, except in a medical emergency, unless the physician performing or inducing the abortion has made a determination of the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child or has relied upon another physician’s determination of postfertilization age. The bill prohibits any person from performing or inducing, or attempting to perform or induce, an abortion when the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain, unless the woman is undergoing a medical emergency. Under the bill, the unborn child is capable of experiencing pain if the probable postfertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks. When the unborn child is considered capable of experiencing pain and the pregnant woman is undergoing a medical emergency, the bill requires the physician to terminate the pregnancy in the manner that, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive.” Scott Walker didn’t have a hand in drafting the 20-week abortion bill, but the 2016 presidential hopeful has indicated that he would sign the bill without an exemption for cases of rape or incest, the Associated Press reports . Walker said the 20-week abortion ban was “rational and reasonable,” and he added that, “It’s an unborn child, that’s why we feel strongly about it.” ","Politics"

"," This eRumor is false. The video that claims to show the “Muslim world’s reaction” to President Obama’s climate change speech is a parody. The video was posted on the IphoneConservative’s YouTube channel. It showed portions of a commencement address that President Obama gave at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in May 2015 spliced with excerpts from a foreign talk show that were incorrectly subtitled. Link to embeded YouTube video: https://youtu.be/UXodRLLkth4 In the commencement address , President Obama told Coast Guard graduates that climate change posed an imminent threat to national security and that it would “cut to the very core of (the Coast Guard’s) service.” In the viral video, false subtitles made it appear as though foreign-langauge speaking commentators were commenting on the president’s address with statements like: “Is he insane?? Climate change is their number one security threat?” “Is he on drugs?” “It doesn’t make any sense.” “What did you expect from an affirmative action president? This guy has never served in the military, never worked a day in his life.” Within days, the video had nearly 200,000 views. Many of those viewers were duped into believing that foreign commentators had actually said those things about President Obama. But the caption under the video states, “For those that understand ‘Poe’s Law,’ no further disclaimer is required.” And the definition of Poe’s Law is all that’s needed to dispel this eRumor as fiction: “Not to be confused with the law of poetry enshrined by Edgar Allan Poe, the internet Poe’s Law states: ‘Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of fundamentalism that someone won’t mistake for the real thing.’ It was originally formulated by Nathan Poe in 2005 during a debate on christianforums.com about evolution, and referred to creationism rather than all fundamentalism, but has since been expanded.” ","Politics"

"," Girl Scouts of America decides whether or not to allow transgender youth to join the group on a case-by-case basis, but that policy isn’t a new one. Girl Scouts of America first allowed a transgender girl to join a chapter in Colorado in 2011 after she had initially been denied admission, CNN reports : “The Girl Scouts of Colorado blamed the initial decision to exclude the child on ignorance of the scouts’ policy. The state scouts said Bobby was welcome to join Girl Scouts. ‘If a child identifies as a girl and the child’s family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout,’ said the Colorado Girl Scouts, in a statement to a CNN affiliate.” The situation drew criticism from conservative groups that called for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies. It also led Girl Scouts of America to change its national policy on transgender youth: “Girl Scouts is proud to be the premiere leadership organization for girls in the country. Placement of transgender youth is handled on a case-by-case basis, with the welfare and best interests of the child and the members of the troop/group in question a top priority. That said, if the child is recognized by the family and school/community as a girl and lives culturally as a girl, then Girl Scouts is an organization that can serve her in a setting that is both emotionally and physically safe. “These situations are rare and are considered individually with the best interests of all families in mind. Should any girl requiring special accommodations wish to camp, GSUSA recommends that the local council makes similar accommodation that schools across the country follow in regard to changing, sleeping arrangements, and other travel-related activities. With respect to volunteers, Girl Scouts welcomes both male and female adult volunteers and has developed appropriate safeguards regarding roles and responsibilities to ensure that girls receive the proper supervision and support.” The story re-appeared in the headlines in May 2015 after the American Family Association issued an “action alert” that warned people about the “new” Girl Scouts policy on transgender youth: “This means girls in the organization will be forced to recognize and accept transgenderism as a normal lifestyle. Boys in skirts, boys in make-up and boys in tents will become a part of the program. This change will put young innocent girls at risk. Adults are willing to experiment on our kids – both the boys who are confused and the girls who will wonder why a boy in a dress is in the bathroom with them. The Girl Scouts of America has lost its moral compass and needs your encouragement to rescind this new policy. Since 2003, bad policies like this have resulted in GSA’s enrollment dropping by over one million girls, almost 27% of its membership.” After reading the action alert, many believed that the Girl Scouts policy on transgender youth was a new one, even though had been in place for more than four years.

But Now Resolved!","2015-05-11 22:50:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/louisiana-house-bill-195-bans-use-of-cash/"," Louisiana House Bill 195 makes it illegal to use cash to purchase second-hand goods in the state. "," This is an old story that was re-reported as breaking news four years after it was resolved. It’s true that Louisiana House Bill 195 made it illegal to use cash to purchase some second-hand items. But the measure was approved back in 2011, and the controversial parts were later taken out. Four years after House Bill 195 was initially approved, the website Government Slaves re-reported the story as “breaking news” in mid-2015: “Louisiana businesses are suddenly discovering a new law that flew under the radar during the last legislative session: “Cold hard cash. It’s good everywhere you go, right? You can use it to pay for anything. “But that’s not the case here in Louisiana now. It’s a law that was passed during this year’s busy legislative session. “House bill 195 basically says those who buy and sell second hand goods cannot use cash to make those transactions, and it flew so far under the radar most businesses don’t even know about it.” That story about the “criminalization of cash” was lifted directly from a 2011 report by KFLY, a local broadcaster in Baton Rouge, on the legislation’s impact on local second-hand dealers. Many blog sites picked up the story in 2015, and soon many readers believed that House Bill 195 had just been approved. Reports that cash had been criminalized in in Louisiana quickly went viral. Back in 2011, State Rep. Rickey Hardy said he had co-sponsored House Bill 195 to deter criminals from stealing and re-selling merchandise to second-hand dealers, “It’s a mechanism to be used so the police department has something to go on and have a lead.” Instead of cash, Hardy said, people could use checks, cashier’s checks or electronic transactions to purchase second-hand goods in the state. House Bill 195 was approved in July 2011 and it took effect in August 2011. Second-hand dealers who failed to comply with the bill three times or more could have been fined up to $10,000 and face up to five years in prison — but that didn’t stick. An amendment to House Bill 195 was approved in 2012 that struck the bill’s controversial parts. The amended version made the law apply only to businesses that purchase second-hand copper, which is frequently stolen from buildings and sold to scrap dealers. So, it’s legal to buy second-hand goods at flea markets, pawnshops and garage sales in Louisiana with cash, contrary to what the eRumor reports. ","Politics"

Have you heard what the troops are calling the Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopter Hillary Clinton used on her Iraq tour? ‘Broomstick One'” In 2003, then-Senator Hillary Clinton toured Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan over the Thanksgiving holiday. The New York Times reports that Clinton was received well by the troops: “Senator Clinton received a generally warm reception from members of the military, who are often perceived as conservative and Republican. “After the meal, more than a dozen soldiers formed a line to have their photographs taken with the former first lady. A half dozen asked for her autograph, often inscribed to their daughters. One soldier had Mrs. Clinton autograph an American flag.” However, Hillary Clinton’s 2003 tour of the Middle East quickly became a hotbed for eRumors about her interactions with troops — and that continues today. First, Hillary Clinton posed for a photo with an unnamed troop who crossed his fingers as the photo was taken, which is a military signal for coercion. Claims circulated the web that Clinton’s handlers had forced the unwilling soldier to pose with her for a photo-op, and TruthorFiction.com found that to be true .

A report released by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that 218 Puerto Ricans had received disability benefits from 2011 to 2013 because they didn’t speak English. That angered many people because Puerto Rico is a predominately Spanish-speaking country, even though both English and Spanish are listed as its official languages . The Social Security Administration has medical-vocational guidelines that assume people who can’t read or write in English have limited ability to find a job in the U.S., making them eligible for disability benefits. The problem is that these guidelines — or grid rules — also apply to Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory) even though most people in the country speak Spanish, according to the report : “A claimant asserting an inability to read, write, or communicate in English may increase his/her likelihood of receiving disability benefits under the English-language grid rules in Puerto Rico when the claimant’s residual functional capacity and other vocational factors line up under grid rules. In attempting to determine the number of cases associated with the English-language grid rules, we found the agency lacked complete data to determine how often adjudicators in Puerto Rico used these grid rules since policy required DDS staff report on only a portion of the cases where these grid rules were relevant.” The report said that the Social Security Administration would change its rules so that “factors that may affect a claimant’s ability to adjust to other work in the economy” could be considered.

"," This one is a combination of truth and fiction. Guns have historically been restricted in some areas of National Rifle Association (NRA) conventions because of gun laws and anti-weapon policies in place at some venues. The 2015 NRA convention planned for Nashville, Tennessee, in April 2015 was no different. The NRA said that “lawfully carried firearms” would be allowed at its annual meeting and expo held at the Music City Center, but not at the music concerts held at the Bridgestone Arena: “During the 2015 NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits, lawfully carried firearms will be permitted in the Music City Center with the proper license in accordance with Tennessee law. Bridgestone Arena prohibits the possession of firearms. When carrying your firearm, remember to follow all federal, state and local laws.” The Bridgestone Arena, which is home to the NHL’s Nashville Predators, states on its website that weapons are prohibited there. A Music City Center staffer said organizations holding events there decide whether or not people are allowed to carry guns inside. The NRA said it didn’t have a problem with it. The ban on “operational” guns applies to guns for sale on the convention floor, The Tennessean reports : “A multilevel security plan went into works not long after Nashville was chosen as the convention destination. All guns on the convention floor will be nonoperational, with the firing pins removed, and any guns purchased during the NRA convention will have to be picked up at a Federal Firearms License dealer, near where the purchaser lives, and will require a legal identification.” This isn’t the first time that guns have been restricted at an NRA convention, either. A similar scenario played out in 2014 when the NRA held part of its convention at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis where weapons aren’t allowed. When the convention was held in Charlotte in 2010, concealed carry wasn’t allowed at all, NPR reports .

"," This is an unproven conspiracy theory about how Democratic Senator Harry Reid was injured on New Year’s Eve. Harry Reid’s staff said that the senator broke bones in his face and his ribs when a piece of exercise equipment broke and sent him hurtling into some cabinets on New Year’s Eve. Reid later had surgery to remove a blood clot from his eye and to repair broken orbital bones, his staff said . Conspiracy theories about Harry Reid’s injuries went into overdrive when he announced that he had decided not to seek re-election after the accident had given him down time to “ponder and think.” The theory that Harry Reid suffered the injuries in a fight with his brother, Larry, went viral after the blog site Power Line made the case for it in a series of posts . The site reported that an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor named Easton Elliott said that Larry Reid showed up at a meeting in Henderson, Nevada, on New Year’s Eve drunk and covered in blood and told the group about a fight with a family member: “Easton Elliott didn’t think much more about Larry until, several weeks later, he saw a newspaper story about Larry Reid, Harry Reid’s brother, being arrested for DUI and assaulting a highway patrolman. The story was accompanied by a photograph, and Elliott immediately recognized Larry Reid as the ‘Larry’ who had attended the AA meeting on New Year’s Eve. Putting that fact together with news stories about Harry Reid being admitted to a hospital on New Year’s Day, and with Larry’s references to the Secret Service, he concluded that the family member with whom Larry fought was Harry Reid. He also knew that Harry Reid’s home is within a short distance of the location of the AA meeting.” It’s true that Larry Reid was arrested for drunken driving and assaulting a state patrol officer in February of 2015, the Las Vegas Journal Review reports . But, outside of Easton Elliott’s first-hand account, there’s no proof that Harry and Larry Reid got into a fistfight on New Years Eve. And there’s no way to tell if Easton Elliott is a real person or not. The blog post said that the name “Easton Elliott” was made up by a Las Vegas businessman to use in his second career as an addiction recovery life coach. The only trace of Easton Elliott online is a Linkedin profile that has zero connections. And although Power Line published Easton Elliott’s account, the website didn’t endorse it, or him: “That is Easton Elliott’s account. I can’t vouch for it, of course, but if what he says about the AA meeting is accurate, the inferences he draws seem reasonable.” Despite conspiracy theories like this one about how Harry Reid was injured, there’s no proof that it was from anything more than a freak workout accident at this time.

MacArthur in 1945. "," President Truman did not explain political correctness to General MacArthur in a series of telegraphs. The chain email claims General MacArthur had never heard of the the term “politically correct” and that President Truman had to explain it to him just before Japan’s World War II surrender in 1945. But the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum told TruthorFiction.com that those correspondences “do not exist in the library’s holdings.” The library spokesperson also added that the chain email got Chester Nimitz’s middle initial wrong. It’s Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, not C.H. Nimitz. The chain email doesn’t make sense when it comes to other historical details as well. The earliest use of the term “politically correct” came in 1936, according to Merriam-Webster : “Full Definition of POLITICALLY CORRECT:  conforming to a belief that language and practices which could offend political sensibilities (as in matters of sex or race) should be eliminated.” It seems unlikely that General MacArthur wouldn’t have heard of the term before the Surrender Document with Japan in September of 1945. And the chain email unfairly paints General MacArthur as a simple military commander who wasn’t familiar with the finer points of diplomacy, but that wasn’t the case. He spent five years rebuilding Japan after the war ended, according to his biography : “While showing appropriate respect for the Emperor, MacArthur purged the Japanese militarists, throwing some in jail and prosecuting others for war crimes. Working through the Japanese government, he disarmed the country’s military forces, confiscated chemical warfare supplies, and ordered the destruction of tanks, planes, bombs, and other military equipment. He also developed and implemented emergency food and medical assistance programs that Morris estimates saved up to three million lives. “His most significant and lasting accomplishment during the occupation, however, was political reform. Japan’s new constitution transformed the country into a modern Western-style democracy with “the world’s most liberal guarantees of civil rights.” Sixty-five years later, Japan remains a vibrant, free, democratic society—a living monument to the success of MacArthur’s occupation policies. As Morris writes, “America’s successful exercise in the occupation of a country … was … America’s greatest feat by America’s greatest general.” For all those reasons, this eRumor is false.

In 2001, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the National Parks Service to have a large cross removed from the Mojave National Preserve in San Bernardino, California. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against the ACLU in that case. And a variation of this eRumor is that the ACLU has sued the government to have all crosses removed from military cemeteries. The group has said that this is a myth : “The ACLU does NOT want to remove crosses from federal cemeteries. To the contrary, we have fought to expand the right of veterans and their families to decide for themselves which religious symbols, if any, mark the military graves of those who served and died for our country.” TruthorFiction.com previously covered the eRumor that the ACLU wants all cross-shaped headstones removed from military cemeteries.

"Why Women Should Vote and The “Iron Jawed Angels”-Truth!","2015-03-30 21:41:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/womens-vote/"," An email that tells the story of the Women’s Suffrage Movement that fought for the right for women to vote and the Home Box Office movie called “Iron Jawed Angels” that aired on television.  It tells of the “Night of Terror” in 1917 when women were arrested for protesting at the White House, beaten and tortured and says that it as a reminder for all to vote. "," This email covers only part of the story. Women’s rights had been an issue throughout the early history of the United States along with the abolition of slavery. There is a complete timeline posted on the Library of Congress web site in a section dedicated to The National American Woman’s Suffrage Association collection consisting of 167 books, pamphlets and other artifacts documenting the suffrage campaign.  The Library of Congress timeline begins with Abigail Adams who wrote a memo to her husband in 1776 to remind the Continental Congress while they were drafting the Constitution of the United States to “remember the ladies.” It wasn’t until after the civil war and the abolishment of slavery in the US that the women’s movement began to gain momentum as the next battle for civil rights. In 1866 Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the American Equal Rights Association, an organization dedicated to the goal of universal suffrage. In 1872 Susan B. Anthony was arrested and fined $100 for trying to enter a polling place to vote for Ulysses S Grant.  Former slave, Sojourner Truth showed up at a polling booth in Battle Creek, Michigan, demanding a ballot but was turned away. According to the case posted in the University of Kansas City Law School Anthony never paid her fine and “no serious effort was made by the government to collect it.” In 1878 A Woman Suffrage Amendment  was introduced in the United States Congress proposing “The right of citizens to vote shall not be abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex” but was not ratified by Congress until August 18, 1920. In 1913 Teddy Roosevelt adopted the woman’s suffrage cause as a plank on his Bull Moose Party platform when he ran for a third term for President of the United States. Throughout the course of time there were many groups and conventions promoting the right to vote for women. Lucy Burns and Alice Paul organized the Congressional Union eventually changing the name to the National Women’s Party which got them noticed.  Their tactics were more radical and militant than the groups that preceded them and included hunger strikes, picketing the White House, and engaging in other forms of civil disobedience to publicize the suffrage cause. In 1917 members of the movement staged a massive protest in front of the Whitehouse in Washington DC. Hundreds of women were arrested on charges of “obstructing sidewalk traffic.”  Many were convicted and sentenced to prison at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia. In 2004 HBO (Home Box Office) produced and released the docudrama “Iron Jawed Angels” staring Hillary Swank as Alice Paul and Frances O’Connor as Lucy Burns.  It gives an account of the history of the movement and does show Lucy Burns , who went on a hunger strike during her incarceration, being forced fed through a tube down her throat. Doris Stevens (1892-1963) wrote her firsthand account of treatment and conditions in which the suffragists were held at the Occoquan Workhouse in 1917 in a book called “Jailed for Freedom”  and it can be found at the Gutenberg Project website, a collection of writing that were produced by tens of thousands of volunteers. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Susan B. Anthony Dollar Coin Act into law making her the first woman to be honored by having her likeness appear on a circulating United States coin.

"Cornell University Would Welcome ISIS Training Camps, Speakers-Disputed!","2015-03-29 17:41:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cornell-university-would-welcome-isis-training-camps-and-speakers/"," A Cornell University dean said he would allow an ISIS training camps and speakers on the campus. "," Claims that an assistant dean at Cornell said ISIS training exercises and speakers would be allowed there are disputed. A man posing as a student from Morocco used a hidden camera to record an exchange with Cornell Dean for Students Joseph Scaffido for Project Veritas , an organization founded by conservative activist James O’Keefe. In the video, the student asks Scaffido questions about starting a humanitarian group for distressed areas of the Middle East, bringing people to the campus to speak, and holding training exercises for “freedom fighters.” Here’s a transcript of the conversation: Student: I think maybe it would be nice to start a humanitarian group that supports distressed communities, a humanitarian group in the Middle East, in northern Iraq and Syria. I think it would be important especially for people in the Islamic State Iraq and Syria, the families and the freedom fighters in particular. I think it would be important to maybe just probably educate, but to maybe send them care packages, whether it be food, water, electronics. Scaffido: There are a lot of our student organizations that do things like that all over the world. Student: If you did like, supported like Hamas or something like that, is that a problem? Scaffido: The university is not going to look at different groups and say, ‘You’re not allowed to support that group because we don’t believe in them,’ or something like that. I think it’s just the opposite. I think the university wants the entire community to understand what’s going on in all parts of the world. Student: That would be good. Maybe, you know, get a group that educates on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and just educate people, maybe bring them in. Scaffido: Ithaca is a great place. Ithaca itself, the community of Ithaca is also very active. I don’t know if you’ve talked to many people about it, it’s very liberal; the community is a very liberal community … There are funding sources on campus … kind of like grants, programming money. If I wanted to bring in a speaker… Student: Maybe we could get like a freedom fighter to come and do like a training camp for students? Scaffido: I have no idea. I mean, you would be allowed to do something like that. It’s just like bringing in a coach to do training on a sports team or something. Scaffido definitely doesn’t say that these things wouldn’t be allowed on campus. But an unedited version of the video would be needed to understand his actual responses. After video of the interview went viral, Cornell officials shot back that it had been creatively edited to make Scaffido appear to endorse ISIS training camps and speakers on the campus. In a statement , Cornell University President David Skorton said the video’s allegations were ludicrous and offensive: “As the president of Cornell University, I want to be clear that the notion that Cornell would allow ISIS training sessions on our campus is ludicrous and absolutely offensive. “Project Veritas, the organization behind this shoddy piece of ‘journalism’ has been repeatedly vilified for dishonest, deceitful activity. It is shameful that any individual would pose as a student facing racial discrimination at another university, ask leading questions on hidden camera about Cornell’s tolerance for differing viewpoints and backgrounds, and then conveniently splice together the resulting footage to smear our assistant dean and our University. After speaking with Assistant Dean Scaffido, I am convinced that he was not aware of what he was being asked. “Let me be clear: Cornell has an unwavering commitment to the free and responsible exchange of ideas. However, we remain vigilant in maintaining an appropriate balance of freedom of expression within accepted boundaries. Of course, incitement to violence is not protected and would never be tolerated on our campus.” ","Politics"

"," The President’s dog, Bo, and his handler did travel to Maine on a second aircraft when the First Family travelled there in July 2010 for their Summer vacation, but Bo and handler were not alone.  This eRumor surfaced a year later, in 2011, while the President and his family vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard, 367 miles south of the airport where they landed a year earlier. 2013 Vacation Bo prepares for take-off During the President’s 2013 vacation to Martha’s Vineyard, the first pooch once again travel to the vacation spot but this time travelled in class on a MV-22 Osprey. This according to an August 11, 2013 article by England’s The Telegraph .   The article described the Presidential pet’s aircraft as “a hybrid aircraft which takes off like a helicopter but flies like a plane.” Once again, Bo did not have the aircraft to himself.  According to an August 10th article by CBS News , he travelled with White House Staff, media and Secret Service. 2010 Vacation The Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton, Maine is a small airport and can not accommodate large aircraft such as the Boeing 747 that the President uses for Air Force One.   For this reason two aircraft were needed for the entire entourage who accompanied the First Family. Local reporters from the Morning Sentinel of Central Maine were on hand to cover the Obama’s arrival at the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport but somehow not all the facts made it in it’s first edition of the local paper.  The original story reported that the first family arrived at the airport in a plane shortly after Bo and his handler were seen exiting another aircraft and left the impression that the dog and handler traveled alone on their own plane. Some time after the story was released the newspaper added a clarification saying, “Today’s story about the arrival of the Obama’s said the Obama’s dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president’s usual jet.” Doug Powers wrote a commentary on that July 17, 2010 news story that appeared in the Morning Sentinel of Central Maine .  It was then posted on the Michelle Malkin website but went viral on the World Wide Web a year later.

"," It’s true that Ted Cruz was born in Canada, but that doesn’t mean he can’t run for president. After Cruz announced that he would run for president in 2016, questions came up about the location of his birth and the status of his citizenship. That wasn’t the first time people have questioned the Texas Republican’s birthplace, either. Those questions led Cruz to release his birth certificate in 2013. It says he was born in Calgary to Eleanor Wilson and Rafael Bienvenido Cruz. At the time of his birth, Cruz’s mother was an American citizen, and his father was a Cuban citizen, the Dallas Morning News reports : “The U.S. Constitution allows only a ‘natural born’ American citizen to serve as president. Most legal scholars who have studied the question agree that includes an American born overseas to an American parent, such as Cruz.” The law says that Cruz’s mother would have had to live in the U.S. for 10 years, and that she had to be older than 14 for at least five of those years, in order for her son to be born a natural U.S. citizen. Nobody has questioned that she did that. But, oddly enough, Cruz was considered a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada until he renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Questions about the citizenship of presidential candidates are not new. Senator John McCain faced questions when he ran for president in 2008 because he was born on a military base in Panama.

The email also says that 35 governors have sued for a 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would limit federal power. "," Both of these claims are false. There is a Student Loan Repayment Program in place to help attract and retain federal employees, but it does not extend to family members. Elected officials, uniform service members and other government employees are eligible under the law . Federal employees can have up to $10,000 in federally insured student loans repaid each year, and up to $60,000 repaid over their career, the Office of Personnel Management reports . And the federal government does not forgive these loans, as the eRumor claims. The loans are repaid. That’s important because it means federal employees have to pay taxes on loan payments just like the rest of their salaries. In 2013, $52.9 million in student loan repayments were made for 7,314 federal employees, the Office of Personnel and Management reports . The email’s claim that 35 governors had sued the U.S. government for a 28th amendment is also false. The email says that the proposed 28th amendment would state: “Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators, Representatives of Congress; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and/or Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States…” That same language was used in an eRumor that TruthorFiction.com found to be false in 2013.

"President Obama Talks About Mandatory Voting in the US – Truth!","2015-03-20 18:46:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-talks-about-mandatory-voting-in-the-us/"," President Obama said that mandatory voting for U.S. citizens would help make money in politics less powerful. "," It’s true that President Obama talked about mandatory voting at a town hall meeting. But the White House later denied that he planned to make it a law. President Obama was asked about the impact of money in politics at a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 18, 2015. Obama replied that mandatory voting would be one way to make money less powerful: “We shouldn’t be making it harder to vote. We should be making it easier to vote. I’ve said that publicly before. So, my Justice Department is going to be vigorous in terms of trying to force voting rights. I gave a speech down in Selma on the 50th anniversary, and it was incredibly moving for me, and my daughters, and the notion that in this day and age we would be deliberately trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense. At the state and local levels you can push back against that and make sure we’re expanding the franchise, not restricting it. “In Australia, that’s one of the countries that have mandatory voting. It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything. If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country because the people who tend not to vote are young, they’re lower income, they’re skewed more heavily toward immigrant groups and minority groups. They’re often the folks who are scratching and climbing to get into the middle class and working hard. There’s a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls when we should be trying to get them into the polls. So, that may be a better strategy in the short-term.” A day after the president’s remarks, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the president had given an “open-ended answer” to the question. Earnest added that, “The president was not making a specific policy prescription for the United States.” About 40% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. In Australia, voters are required to go to the polls, but they aren’t forced to cast a ballot. About 95% of people turn out for elections there, and the other 5% “may incur a small fine if insufficient excuse is offered,” wrote Haydon Manning, a professor at the University of Rochester.

"," People close to Bill and Hillary Clinton have said that Valerie Jarrett leaked negative stories about Hillary to the press — but Jarrett has denied it. There’s no hard evidence to prove whether rumors about mudslinging between the Clintons and the Obama Administration are true, but let’s take a look at how the eRumor started. Hillary Clinton’s email scandal blew up in early March of 2015. Reports that Clinton had used a private email account and a personal email server during her time as secretary of state raised questions about whether she had broken federal laws. Daniel Metcalfe, a former Department of Justice official, wrote in Politico: “In this case, which is truly unprecedented, no matter what Secretary Clinton would have one believe, she managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the (Freedom of Information Act), both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it — perhaps forever. ‘Nice work if you can get it,’ one might say, especially if your experience during your husband’s presidency gives you good reason (nay, even highly compelling motivation) to relegate unto yourself such control if at all possible.” Rumors that Valerie Jarrett and other White House officials had leaked the email scandal to the press started days after the story broke. The New York Post cited unnamed sources from Bill Clinton’s camp who made that claim, and the story spread like wildfire: “Members of Bill Clinton’s camp say the former president suspects the White House is the source of the leak and is furious. “’My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us,’ one of Bill’s friends quotes him as saying. ‘The Obamas are behind the email story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.’ “Then, according to this source, Bill added: ‘The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.’” The Post also reported that the White House would leak more negative stories about Hillary Clinton. Valerie Jarrett denied that on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” She said that the claim was “preposterous” during an interview : “It’s preposterous … as the president said last week, he really prides himself on having an administration that is transparent, and he’s glad to see that he’s turning over her emails to the State Department. So, yes, that’s very important.” This probably isn’t the last we’ll hear about this eRumor. Check back for future updates. ","Politics"

"Questions about President Obama Long Form Birth Certificate","2015-03-18 21:40:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-birth-certificate/"," Various questions raised about the legitimacy of the long-form birth certificate of President Barack Hussein Obama that was released by the White House on April 27, 2011. "," The image below was released by the White House which it says is of the long-form birth certificate of President Barack Hussein Obama.  Within 24 hours questions from disbelievers speculating on its authenticity and contents began circulating the Internet en masse. We will be looking into more questions and addressing them on this page so please check back often as new eRumors about the President’s birth certificate develop. Here are some of the questions which we have been able to address: Kenya was not called Kenya until it gained its independence from Britain in 1963 so it should not have been identified as so on the birth certificate- Fiction! Kenya got its name from a mountain of the same name where the Kikuyu people who lived in that region called the snow capped mountain “Kirinyaga” or “Kerenyaga,” which meant “mountain of whiteness.”  Mt. Kirinyaga (today Mt. Kenya) was the main landmark of the region and it also became the name of the territory that the British later claimed as their colony.   There was a small problem with the British not being able to pronounce Kirinyaga correctly.  To remedy this the land was simplified to Kenya when it became a protectorate of Great Britain in 1895.  From then on the area was known as Kenya although it was part of the East Africa Protectorate.  In 1920 the protectorate changed its name to the Colony of Kenya.   After close to eight years of violence and uprisings Kenya won their independence from the British in 1963. The Hospital on the birth certificate, “Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital” did not exist until 1978- Fiction! Author Jerome Corsi at World Net Daily wrote an article called “ A Tale Of Two Birth Certificates ” where he compared a 1961 long form certificate similar to the President’s.  Corsi used this birth certificate for his evaluation of the President’s birth certificate. The hospital named on both certificates appear to be exactly the same. The “Rosetta Stone” Long Form Certificate of Live Birth from Jerome Corsi’s article A Brief History of Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital In 1890, using inherited land from her deceased sister on the condition it would be used to help Hawaiian maternity mothers, Queen Kapiʻolani, raised $8,000 and founded the Kapiʻolani Home of the Hoolu and Hoola Lahui Society. Throughout the years the needs of mothers having babies grew and more property needed to be acquired and eventually in 1918 the home moved to a two-story house with 25 beds. It was then when the name was first changed to the Kapiʻolani Maternity Home and for the first time the doors were opened to all women, not just Hawaiians. In 1929, as the needs continued to grow the home moved again to a larger building with 50 beds and expanded its mission to the study and treatment of non-infectious gynecological problems. Three years later, in 1931, the name was changed to the Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital. This is the name of the facility that appeared on the long form certificate of live birth of Barack Hussein Obama II. The hospital kept this name until 1971, ten years after the birth of Barack Obama, when they changed its name to Kapiʻolani Hospital. Between 1929 and 1977 this facility delivered 145,000 babies. The number on the long form birth certificate is different from the number on the document released in 2008- Fiction! Both numbers the 2008 birth certificate and the long form birth certificate are identical. The original image of the 2008 birth certificate was blacked out when it was released on Barack H. Obama’s  Fight the Smears web site.   The 2008 document was examined by the FactCheck,org website and an image of it was posted on their Internet site displaying the number of the birth certificate of the President.

John Kerry was in Vietnam for only four months- Truth! The eRumor, as indicated, is taken from a guest editorial by Vietnam veteran Terry Garlock that was published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on January 29, 2004. Kerry became a vocal critic of the Vietnam war and his image as a boat commander who became a protester made him an anti-war celebrity. He joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War His 1971 book The New Soldier was a collection of his and other anti-war Vietnam veterans writings and pictures. The book became best known, however, because of its cover. It pictured an anti-Vietnam war protest with a American flag flying upside down.

During his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1972, critics accused him of having desecrated the flag with the book cover Regarding Kerry’s medals, there was an emotional ceremony on 23, 1971, in which about one thousand veterans who were against the Vietnam war shed their military medals by throwing them over a fence barricade onto the steps of the capitol building in Washington D.C. One of them was John Kerry and it was thought that he had forsaken his Vietnam medals. The 1988 issue of Current Biography Yearbook says that Kerry explained that the medals were not his but those of another veteran who asked him to throw them on his behalf. Critics of John Kerry say he either created a false impression by throwing the borrowed medals or spent a long time letting a false impression remain before he admitted that he still had his medals. Defenders say Kerry never misrepresented the medals because he did not claim that they were his and openly displays them in his office. Regarding Kerry’s allegedly publicly supporting the POWs in Vietnam being used as bargaining chips, we have not been able to find that reference.

"Drilling for oil in ANWAR-Truth! & Disputed!","2015-03-17 21:45:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/anwar/"," A message that includes pictures and graphics about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.  It says that the controversial portion of ANWAR where oil drilling could take place is desolate and not reflected by the pretty pictures circulated by opponents of oil drilling in ANWAR.  The message also says that animals, such as caribou and bears, are not bothered by the drilling that has already taken place in nearby Prudhoe Bay and that Al Gore said the government should work to raise gas prices to $5 a gallon.  The bottom line, according to the email, is that the Democrats who are opposed to the oil drilling in ANWAR are lying. "," The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWAR) has been a topic of hot debate between proponents of drilling for oil and environmentalists who are opposed to the drilling. ANWAR was established in 1980 as a part of The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.  The act deferred more permanent decisions about an area of a 1.5 million acre coastal plain, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), “in recognition of the area’s potentially enormous oil and gas resources and its importance as wildlife habitat.” The USGS says that studies of the coastal plan have shown that “technically recoverable oil within the entire assessment area is estimated to be between 5.7 and 16.0 billion barrels.” The eRumor accurately shows the location and size of ANWAR and the appearance of the coastal plain. Opponents of the drilling say that capturing the petroleum in ANWAR will not solve any U.S. oil crisis so why risk the harm to wildlife there?  Specifically, they say that the exploration and drilling activities would take place in the refuge’s most vital areas for such as calving grounds for the porcupine caribou herd and den locations for one of America’s two polar bear populations.  They are especially concerned about the impact of any oil spills on the area, which they contend could affect the entire ecosystem. Supporters of drilling in ANWAR argue that the U.S. needs to use domestic petroleum and that ANWAR could supply gas and oil for 30 to 50 years.  The point to the massive oil fields at nearby Prudhoe Bay and say that drilling there has not negatively affected wildlife.  The Central Arctic caribou herd is friendly with the facilities and has grown from 3,000 to as high as 27,000 over the past 20 years.  Additionally, they say, drilling activity in ANWR would be during the winter months when such wildlife as the caribou are not there. The part of the eRumor about Al Gore, Democrats, and gas prices is a political comment.  We could not find an occasion when Al Gore advocated $5-per-gallon gasoline, but many environmentalists are in favor of steps that would reduce the use of fossil fuels.  It’s possible this is a reference to a speech he gave in the U.S. Senate on April 11, 1991 in which he voiced support of a National Academy of Sciences study.  He said it, “rings the alarm bells again and tells us of the urgent need to take action now to combat global warming.”  Among the recommendations of the study was “restructuring energy prices to more accurately reflect environmental costs.” The picture of the caribou in the email was taken by photographer Carl Donohue and more of his work can be seen on his website.  Carl told TruthOrFiction.com that the Prudhoe Bay caribou do not calve in the area open to oil drilling but that the USGS study concluded that human activity such as development and drilling does have an effect on caribou and denning polar bear, resulting in lower birth rates.

"Obama’s tax proposals-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxes-election/"," A forward email that lists what it says are Barack Obama’s tax proposals if he were elected president. "," This eRumor is a recycled version of one that circulated in March, 2008, about both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  It resurfaced as an Obama eRumor in July, 2008. CAPITAL GAINS, DIVIDENDS Regarding capital gains taxes, Senator Obama has talked in terms of raising capital gains taxes, perhaps as high as 28%, but that would not apply to homes.  U.S. News and World Report’s money and politics blogger James Pethokoukis said that Obama is in favor of a significant increase as part of his “Tax Fairness for the Middle Class” plan.  In an interview with CNBC in March, 2008, Obama said that he favored raising capital gains taxes from %15% to 20% but no higher than 28% Both Obama and McCain favor exempting the first $250,000 of gains from the sale of a primary residence ($500,000 for a married couple on a joint return). So to say that Obama is proposing a 28% capital gains tax on residences is incorrect. The eRumor claims that taxes on dividends would go up to 39.6%.  That is a fabricated number.  Neither candidate has ever advocated a 39.6% tax on anything.  As stated above, Obama talking in terms of raising capital gains, including dividends, to 20% and no higher than 28%. INCOME TAX The forwarded email than lists what income taxes would look like under McCain and Obama.  There is no question that the Obama Democratic proposals will result in higher taxes than McCain’s Republican proposals, but the eRumor reports erroneous numbers. The eRumor starts off giving the wrong figures for current taxes.  Here are the numbers from the eRumor compared with the actual tax rates for 2008 from the Internal Revenue Service site: Single making 30K – tax $4,500——– Actually $4,100 Single making 50K – tax $12,500—— Actually $8,845 Single making 75K – tax $18,750—— Actually $15,094 Married making 60K- tax $9,000——- Actually $8,198 Married making 75K – tax $18,750—- Actually $11,438 Married making 125K – tax $31,250– Actually $23,938 Regarding a comparison of Obama and McCain tax proposals, the Chicago Sun-Times put together its figures in June, 2008. By their estimates, for example, a person with taxable income of $19,000 or less would pay $597 less under Obama and $19 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of $19,000 to $38,000 per year would pay $892 less under Obama’s plan and $113 less under McCain’s. A person with taxable income between $112,000 and $227,000 would pay $2,300 less under Obama and $3,200 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of  $227,000 would pay $23,000 more under Obama and $15,000 less under McCain. INHERITANCE TAX The eRumor says that the inheritance tax was repealed under George W. Bush, which is not true, although there have been numerous attempts to repeal it. According to the Chicago Sun-Times article, McCain would seek to lower the inheritance tax while Obama would raise it on estates more than $3.5 million. Updated 7/18/08 ","Politics"

"," Although the legend was reported to be true by a CBS News photo display with an article about the cars used by U.S. presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt was not driven to Congress in Al Capone’s car to deliver his Pearl Harbor speech. As for the rest of this eRumor, we have classified as disputed. A spokesperson at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library told the TruthOrFiction.com team that FDR did not ride in Al Capone’s car to deliver his speech on December 8, 1941. The spokesperson added that a retired member of the Secret Service, once assigned to protect President Roosevelt, wrote about the 1928 armored Cadillac Town Sedan that once belonged to Al Capone.

Michael Reilly and President Franklin D. Roosevelt The TruthOrFiction.com team was contacted by an Al Capone historian who disputed our findings and provided us with links that document that Al Capone’s Cadillac was sold to a couple who worked in a travelling carnival show who later sold the car to a Mr. H.

Reuters reported the transaction in the clipping below: We found that FDR was rarely seen in any car that was not a convertible.

Embassy Attack Was an Act Of Terrorism – Truth! Senate Report Singled Out State Department for Failing to Bolster Security- Truth! Summary of the eRumor: Two photographs taken of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens during the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya are circulating in forwarded emails. They allege that Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the streets in a preplanned attack while the Obama Administration has called it a protest over an Anti-Muslim video. "," The photos are real and were taken on September 11, 2012 from a video after Ambassador Stevens was found in the wreckage of the sacked Benghazi Outpost. The photos and video have been misinterpreted into something other than what they documented, a rescue. According to a September 18, 2012 article by the Associated Press, “Libyans tried to rescue Ambassador Chris Stevens, cheering ‘God is great’ and rushing him to a hospital after they discovered him still clinging to life inside the U.S. Consulate, according to witnesses and a new video that emerged Monday from last week’s attack in the city of Benghazi.” Eleven years after the terrorist attack of the World Trade Center in New York, there was an attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens along with three members of his U.S. embassy staff were killed. Shortly after that violence erupted around the world at the sites of various U.S. Embassies. Senate Hearing Report Released January 15, 2014 On January 15, 2014 the official report from the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearings was released. Click here for the report. Analysis of the Senate report by the New York Times said in a January 15, 2014 article that the September 11, 2012 attack “that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, could have been prevented, singling out the State Department for criticism for its failure to bolster security in response to intelligence warnings about a growing security crisis around the city.” Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during the incident. Was this a Preplanned Attack or a Protest of an Anti-Muslim Video on YouTube? At first, there were questions asking if this was a preplanned act of terrorism or a protest to an anti-Muslim video on the Internet. President Obama issued a statement about the deaths of Stevens and members of his staff and told the American public that an increase in security measures would be taken to protect U.S. Embassies and members serving in the U.S. diplomatic corps. Three days later Press Secretary Jay Carney, a briefing to reporters, denied any act of planned terrorism saying that the protests were in reaction to an anti-Muslim video. Press Secretary Carney at White House Briefing on YouTube A poorly produced video called Muhammad Movie Trailer that depicted the life of founder of Islam was posted last July on the popular video sharing website, YouTube.com,. We found other samples of the same video titled Innocence of Muslims. It portrayed the Islamic prophet in a satirical sense focusing on his sexual promiscuity and violent past. The video also showed the persecutions Jews by Muhammad as was as persecution of Christians in modern times. With all the negative videos and commentaries on the World Wide Web about Islam, could a fourteen minute video actually spark Muslims to react violently at U.S. Embassies around the world? Reports conflicting to the White House press statement allege that the attack was a strategically planned operation by Al Qaeda who called for the killing of American diplomats and used the protest of the video as a cover for their mission. In a September 16, 2016 article by Fox News, Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif told NPR in an interview that his country had been infiltrated by foreigners over the past few months and said, “We firmly believe that this was a precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to attack the U.S. Consulate.” In a September 19, 2012 article Fox News reported that Intelligence sources told them that the the news network that they were convinced that the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was directly tied to Al Qaeda and was led by a former Guantanamo detainee. The article also said, “in the face of these conflicting accounts, Carney on Tuesday deferred to the ongoing investigation and opened the door to the possibility of other explanations.” It took just over a week after the incident for the White House to finally admit that Americans and been attacked by terrorists. In a September 20, 2012 article Fox News reported that the White House “conceded Thursday that it was ‘self evident’ that it was an act of terror — an admission that took eight days for any administration official to make.” Press Secretary Carney told reporters, “”It is, I think, self evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently and the result was four deaths of American officials. That is self evident.” The White House announcement came after National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen confirmed the act of terrorism during a Senate hearing on September 19th saying, “Yes, they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy.” Posted 09/12/12 Updated 01/17/14 WARNING: The Images below are shocking and may not be suitable for younger audiences.

Emails saying that Fox   News would rebroadcast this special report on Sunday night. In the late summer of   2012 similar emails began to surface that said that Fox News would be airing the   documentary 2016 .   Usually on the following Monday   there is an email saying that these shows did not air because the Obama   administration threatened to pull the FCC license of the news network. "," Updated 9/26/12 This eRumor has risen from the ashes with a new twist.  The latest claim that the documentary 2016 will air on the news network on the weekend is a hoax.  During the month of September we have seen no promotions for the upcoming screening nor has the film aired on the news network.  Also, Fox already has movie channels on the cable and dish networks where such a film would air. 2016 was released in theatres in July 2012 and was out in the movie theatres at the time of this eRumor surfaced. Updated 1/24/10 Rumors have once again hit the Internet telling readers to set their recorders for a special Fox investigation of the friends of President Obama.

Update 3/29/10 : There was no Fox News Special hosted by Sean Hannity on March 28, 2010.  The regular scheduled Sunday evening line up consisted of programs hosted by Chris Wallace, Mike Hucabee and Geraldo Rivera. This eRumor increased in circulation during the weekend of 3/27/10 warning readers to set their recorders to Fox News on Sunday night for a special expose by commentator Sean Hannity on President Obama.  Past forwarded emails omitted the date of the broadcast but this week’s version actually mentioned Sunday March 28, 2010.   An original Sean Hannity Special aired on October 11, 2008 while Barack Obama was campaigning for the Oval Office. This is not the first incident of a false warning of the Fox airing. During the week of August 3, 2009 eRumors began circulating to alert viewers of a special program that Fox News Network would be airing on Sunday, August 9, 2009 hosted by Sean Hannity.  Our investigation team closely monitored the Fox News Channel but did not see any  promotions during the commercial breaks to advertise the “special” program nor was there any mention of the upcoming special during normal programming. The following Monday, August 10, 2009, eRumors began to circulate saying that the program did not air or was content was edited. Some versions of the email go as far to blame the Obama Administration for silencing the program.   The TruthorFiction.com investigation team is awaiting a response from Fox News. This eRumor originally circulated heavily during the weekend of October 11, 2008 but the program aired Sunday, October 5th, 2008 .  That program aired as it was supposed to and was very well promoted during the week. Sean Hannity hosted an evening news commentary program for 12 years on the Fox News Network along with Alan Colmes at 9PM (Eastern) weeknights on the Fox News Network. Hannity and Colmbes have parted company and Sean now hosts “Hannity’s America” news/talk program in the same time slot.  Hannity is a conservative and Colmes is a liberal and together they discuss news items with guests and contributors from both perspectives in an attempt to bring what they call a “Fair and Balanced” commentary of current events. Hannity also has a Sunday night program called “Hannity’s America” and on October 5th, 2008 the Fox News Network aired a feature called Obama & Friends: History of Radicalism. Hannity said it investigated the Democratic candidate’s “ties to controversial people and radical groups including exclusive information revealed for the first time.” The program included topics such as whether Barack Obama was involved with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), his college years and his role as a community organizer.

"President Obama  Enacted the Dream Act by Executive Order- Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-dream-act-executive-order/"," This is a forwarded rumor that says the Dream Act, a bill that grants permanent resident status to immigrants under certain conditions, was enacted into law by President Obama by Executive Order on June 24, 2011. "," There is a Dream Act ( H.R.1842 & S. 952 ) and the bill is in still in the committee stage of the legislative process.   In late June 2011, when we first investigated this eRumor,  there was no evidence of any such executive order found on the official White House Executive Order web site.   On June 15, 2012, one year later, during an election year, President Obama announced from the White House Rose Garden that his administration would enacting policy changes to stop the deportation of people who were children when their parents illegally entered and settled in the U.S. Click for statement. In the days following the announcement several news agencies have reported that President Obama issued an executive order that bypassed Congress to allow more than 800,000 young people to remain legally in the U.S. without fear of being deported but there has yet to be official executive order on the White House web site. Click for White House Executive Order page. The Dream Act: The Dream Act is a bill that was fist introduced in the Senate back in 2001.  This bill would grant conditional permanent resident status for certain long-term residents who entered the united states as children, if they met certain criteria. The word DREAM is an acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. The Hill, a newspaper that reports on the daily business in Congress while it is in session, has been following the progress of this act and in a May 11, 2011 article said the Dream Act would include immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children. According to the text of the Dream Act, some of the conditions that must be met by immigrants are that they must currently be residing in the United States and have a “good moral character during the entire period of conditional permanent resident status.”  Eligibility can also be granted to those who have “acquired a degree from an institution of higher education in the United States or has completed at least 2 years, in good standing, in a program for a bachelor’s degree or higher degree in the United States.”  There is also a condition for those who have served or are currently serving in the U. S. Military for at least 2 years.  If they are no longer serving and have been discharged they must show proof of an honorable discharge. Over the years, the bill has failed to pass in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which are the two necessary steps for a bill before it can be signed into law by the President.  The Dream act has been brought up a number of times since 2001.  The last time, in 2010 before the 111th Congress under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi.  Congress passed the bill on December 8, 2010 but it was met by tough opposition from the Senate according to an article posted that day in The Hill .

"Photo of Nancy Pelosi Posing as Miss Lube Rack 1955- Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/miss-lube-rack-1951-05012013/"," This is a photo that went viral in political blogs on the Internet that alleged Congresswoman Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi posed as a bathing beauty in 1955.  The eRumor said that the future Congressional Representative for California was Miss Lube Rack 1955. "," The photo is real but it is not of Congressional Representative Nancy Pelosi. The photo was taken in 1951 at the Muller Brothers Oldsmobile Tires and Carwash in Los Angeles, California by Life Magazine.  The photo was one of many that appeared in a photo documentary about the world’s largest automotive service station.   The idea for the beauty contest was to celebrate the 3,000,000th vehicle to go through the car wash.  This according to a May 16, 2012 article published in the blog site of John Straub. Nancy Pelosi was born in 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, where her family had deep political roots. Pelosi would have been 11 years old at the time that the photo was taken. The photo turned out to be an interesting artifact of Hollywood history and the Muller family, who settled in Los Angeles in 1893.  The family empire began with a fish market, which was later sold so they could establish Hollywood’s first ice company.  In the 1920’s the Mullers entered the automotive business, which later resulted in a massive automotive complex with an Oldsmobile dealership and Firestone Tire store.  The center also included a car wash, cafe, body shop, home appliance center and auto parts and supply store. According to the Foundation to support Hollywood Heritage the Muller car complex was located on the corner of Sunset and Ivar. It was not uncommon to see Hollywood celebrities at the car complex getting their cars washed or serviced. The complex was conveniently located across the street from the Muller family home.  The area where the family once lived later became the site for the RCA Building and today it is the home of the Los Angeles Film School. Today, the former site of the world’s largest service station is now home of another famous Hollywood landmark, the Cinerama Dome Theater.

"," This eRumor is an unproven conspiracy theory. The first member on the list is Arif Alikhan, who has been serving in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since 2006.  His first appointment was Deputy Mayor for Homeland Security and Public Safety for the city of Los Angeles. Alikhan is a first generation American and his parents immigrated from Pakistan. One of his primary tasks over the years has been to educate our government and military on the culture and mindset of the terrorists that that the U.S. has been fighting since it began the War on Terror.   In 2009, DHS head Janet Napolitano appointed Alikhan  Assistant Secretary for Policy Development. Imam Mohamed Magid naturalized citizen who immigrated to the United States from the Sudan in 1987.  In 2011 President Barack Obama appointed Magid to serve in a Countering Violent Extremism Working Group with the DHS.  On January 22, 2013 Magid took part in the inaugural ceremonies of President Obama but the White House has no Sharia Czar, a title given to Iman Magid by critics of the Obama Administration. Mohamed Elibiary is an advisor to the Department of Homeland Security.  Out of this list he probably is the most controversial.   According to a November 9, 2011 CBN News article, Elibiary spoke at a Texas conference in 2004 and honored Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini as a “great Islamic visionary.”  Elibiary is a  member of the Department of Homeland Security’s Advisory Council.  He was granted access to a nationwide database that contained terror watch lists and sensitive FBI reports, which he was accused of leaking portions of the  documents to the media in order to spread charges of “Islamophobia” within Governor Rick Perry’s Texas government. Eboo Patel came to the United States as a child when his parents immigrated from Mumbai, India. Patel serves on President Barack Obama’s inaugural Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships.  As a child Patel lived in Glen Ellyn, Illinois where he attended Glenbard South High School and went on to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and earned a degree in Sociology.  He is a Rhodes Scholar and earned his doctorate in Sociology at Oxford. While attending Oxford Patel oversaw a number of interfaith youth projects in India, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. Rashad Hussain is a first generation American of parents who immigrated to the U.S. from India.  He was born in Wyoming, raised in Plano, Texas and is a graduate of the Greenhill School in Dallas.  Hussain later  attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he earned his bachelor’s degrees in both philosophy and political science.  In 2009 he was a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and served as an Associate Counsel to the Obama Presidential Transition Team.  On February 13, 2010 President Obama appointed Hussain as the United States Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.  He was awarded In January 2013 the Distinguished Honor Award for “exceptionally outstanding service to the agencies of the U.S. Government resulting in achievements of marked national or international significance.”  Hussain is an advocate  for the protection of religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries. Salam al-Marayati was born in Bagdad, Iraq and at the age of 4 his family immigrated to the U.S.  He became a naturalized citizen and earned a bachelors of science degree in Bio-Chemistry from the University of California Los Angeles.  According to his bio Al-Marayati is one of the founders of the Muslim Public Affairs Council and is currently the director of the organization. Al-Marayati has been a member of the Executive Committee of the California Democratic Party. His political experience stems back to 1992 where he was a delegate at the 1992 and 1996 Democratic National Convention.  He is a writer for the Islamic magazine, The Minaret, and has covered Republican conventions as a reporter.  In 2012 al-Marayati was appointed by the President to the U..S. delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe forum in Poland.  This raised many concerns from critics of the Obama administration because al-Marayati is an “outspoken critic of Israel who once said the Jewish state should be added to the list of 9/11 terror suspects.”  This according to an October 17, 2012 article by Fox News.

"," Many eRumors and opinions are still circulating about the Health Care Reform Bill or HR-3200 which was abandoned for a new bill 1990 page bill HR-3962 titled the  “Affordable Health Care for America Act.” On December 24, 2009 the Senate passed the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” by a yea-nay vote of 60-39.  The House version of the 2409 page bill is HR-3590.  On the afternoon of March 18, 2010 Congress announced that the House posted an additional package, HR-4872 – Reconciliation Act of 2010, that contains 153 pages of fixes to the Healthcare bill.   On March 21, 2010, Congress passed the two bills. In November 2010 the Republican Party won majority control of Congress on the campaign promise that they would repeal Obamacare.  The new GOP led Congress met on January 19, 2011 to debate the repeal of the Health Care Reform Law.  They voted 245 to 189 in favor to repeal the bill.    The next step for the bill is to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has vowed to block it.  The text of HR-2 – Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act  can be found at this link: Click for HR-2 The current Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act HR-3590 and the Reconciliation Act of 2010HR-4872 can be viewed on the Thomas Library site: Click for HR-3590 Click for HR-4872 On October 1, 2013 the Affordable Care Act roll out began with the opening of the long awaited sign up website at HealthCare.gov . The roll out was shaky after a series of website crashes as people tried to investigate their health care options. A short time later letters from insurance companies began to be sent to nearly 5 million people living in the U.S. notifying them of policy terminations because of new regulations set down by the Affordable care act. When people called the insurance companies they were directed to purchase new policies. TruthOrFiction.Com has a special report. Click here for report. HR-3590 eRumors: Medical devices sold will now have a  2.3% Excise Tax- Truth! According to the Internal Revenue Service , “section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer or importer of the device.”  This is a 2.3 % of the sale price of taxable medical devices and went into effect January 1, 2013.   Some items are exempt from the tax, such as eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids.   According to the Internal Revenue Service, it is the manufacturer or importer of the taxable medical device who is responsible for paying the excise tax, not the consumer.  Customers should not see any added taxes on their sales slips but the cost of the actual item to customers could increase as a result of this excise tax. Some versions of this rumor include a photo of a sales slip from a sporting goods chain and allege that the tax is included on sporting equipment.   The tax is not applicable on anything other than the medical devices. Real estate sales will be taxed 3.8%- Mostly Truth! Congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois released a statement on March 21, 2010  on HR-3590 saying that the health care bill will increase taxes “by imposing a new 3.8% tax on capital gains.” At first, it was believed that taxes and surcharges could be imposed on income over $250,000 for single tax filers and $500,000 for married couples filing together.  That imposed tax is to help fund the $210 Billion needed to fund the new Health Care Bill. According to the National Board of Realtors, the new law will take effect January 1, 2013 and  “may impose a 3.8% tax on some (but not all) income from interest, dividends, rents (less expenses) and capital gains (less capital losses).”   It said that this “tax will fall only on individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) above $200,000 and couples filing a joint return with more than $250,000 AGI.” To help realtors and investors the National Association of Realtors released a brochure that explains the new tax called, The 3.8% Tax Real Estate Scenarios & Examples Effective January 1, 2013. Click here for a copy of the brochure . The actual tax increases may be generated by the HR-4872 Reconciliation Act according a March 21, 2010 article by Life and Health News Insurance News. This is also confirmed in a March 25, 2010 article by CNNMoney.com that said, “couples making $500,000 in wages will pay an additional $2,250. If they made $1 million, they would pay an additional $6,750.  In addition, high-income households would also be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013.” Aspirin Tax become effective June 1, 2013- Truth! & Fiction! Effective June 1, 2013, aspirin will be heavily taxed under Obamacare. The only explanation given was that they are white and they work. No other reason was given, but I thought you’d want to know about it. This is someone’s attempt at humor but all kidding aside Obamacare not affects consumer purchases of aspirin but it also affects all over the counter medications and how consumers should purchase them.    According to a July 5, 2012 article by Fox News there is a medicine cabinet tax in Obamacare, “which since 2011 has barred the 13.5 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts from purchasing over-the-counter medicines with pre-tax funds.” This is not found in the text of HR-3590 but in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HR-4872). Under the old rules prior to Obamacare consumers could use funds in their HSA or other health insurance tax free savings accounts to purchase medication such as aspirin or allergy drugs.  According to the HSA Resources website funds from HSA may be used to pay for qualified medical expense, such as  ambulance costs, artificial limbs, birth control pills,contact lenses, lab fees,  and prescriptions. Employer healthcare insurance contributions on the 2011 W-2 form will be added to the employee’s gross income- Fiction! The amount entered for employer contributions to the health insurance plans on the W-2 form are for evidence that the employee has health insurance coverage.  This amount will not be taxable nor added to the employee’s gross income. In an April 5, 2010 article called “Health Care Reform: 13 Tax Changes on the Way” , Senior Tax Editor, Joan Pryde of the Washington D.C. based Kiplinger Letters wrote about a “requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income.” “The Mark of the Beast” in the Healthcare Bill- Fiction! A new eRumor began circulating in early April 2010 that claims that the new healthcare reform bill includes requirements for every American to have microchips implanted in their bodies that would contain medical and other encoded personal information.  The email message says it may be a form of the “Mark of the Beast” indicated in the Bible as one of the signs of the end of the world.  It is not true. It refers to what is called in the health care legislation the “National Medical Device Registry.”  The registry does exist in the bill but has nothing to do with requiring implanted microchips in American citizens.  It proposes a national database of medical devices that have already been put into people’s bodies such as artificial knees, artificial hips, heart stents, pacemakers, etc.  The purpose of the registry is to track the effectiveness and performance of the devices. Whoever originated this eRumor took the wording from the bill about the medical device registry and added their own interpretation that it involved microchips and would apply to every person. Individuals and families can opt out of the health care system if they belong to a religious organization that has a health care sharing ministry- Truth! Members of some religious organizations may claim a Religious Conscience Exemption if their sects meet the conditions by having a health care sharing ministry that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). Members of the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientists),  might not object to medical care purchasing health insurance.  The church’s official websites says that it teaches members that they “are always free to choose medical treatment, which many individuals feel is the most obvious solution to health difficulties.”  Members might be free to enroll in the health care plan or opt out of it. Amish do not believe an accepting assistance from the government but according to the frequently asked questions section on the Amish.net web site , members of the sect use local doctors, and if they have a medical condition that requires them to do so,  they will seek the help of medical specialists or go to hospitals.  The Amish subscribe to health plans or purchase medical insurance and if they are sick, will treat the ailments at home first. Such individuals and families will not be subject to the 2.5% tax.  This is outlined on pages 326-328 discuss religious conscience exemptions: ‘‘(2) RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS.— ‘‘(A) RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof described in section 1402(g)(1) and an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section. ‘‘(B) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.— ‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual is a member of a health care sharing ministry for the month. ‘‘(ii) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.—The term ‘health care sharing ministry’ means an organization— ‘‘(I) which is described in section 501(c)(3) and is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), ‘‘(II) members of which share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs and without regard to the State in which a member resides or is employed, ‘‘(III) members of which retain membership even after they develop a medical condition, ‘‘(IV) which (or a predecessor of which) has been in existence at all1 times since December 31, 1999, and medical expenses of its members have been shared continuously and without interruption since at least December 31, 1999, and ‘‘(V) which conducts an annual audit which is performed by an independent certified public accounting firm in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and which is made available to the public upon request.

Dingell of the15th district of Michigan.  According to the Thomas Library of Congress the bill was “referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, Education and Labor, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.” As  of July 28, 2009, The Thomas Library reports, “Latest Major Action: 7/21/2009 House committee/subcommittee actions. Status: Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held.”     The status of this bill and text can be found at the Thomas Library by searching the bill number H.R. 3200. Click for Thomas Library.

Mandatory end of life counseling every five years to instruct patients how to determine ways to end suffering- Truth! & Fiction! To be excluded by the Senate! On August 13, 2009 the Associated Press reported that, “Key senators are excluding a provision on end-of-life care from health overhaul legislation after language in a House bill caused a furor.” Click for article Betsy McCaughey, a former New York Lt. Governor and conservative health activist, was interviewed on July 16, 2009 on the of former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson. In the interview she stated that page 425 of the health care bill said that everyone on Social Security & Medicare would have to undergo mandatory counseling every five years to determine ways to end their suffering. The counseling would be more frequent in the case of a terminal illness. McCaughhey’s comments dovetailed with several statements from critics of the health care legislation who claimed that the same portion of the bill could be used to promote euthanasia.  House minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter said that such concerns were valid.  They are quoted by LifeNews.com as saying, that the measure “could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia, mercy-killing, and physican-assisted suicide because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself.” The Vice President of AARP, John Rother, disagrees. He said the bill does not, in his view, create a problem of euthanasia. He said that under the bill, Medicare would be required to cover the consultations for the first time but does not mandate that people get end-of-life consultation. He said that any consultation would be with the patient, the doctor or nurse practitioner—not a government bureaucrat. Pages 424 to 434 in the proposed healthcare bill discusses Advance Care Planning and the mandatory consultation is to discuss end of life services such as hospice care and living wills. Click for Fred Thompson interview. Another eRumor originated by the American Family Association warns of Rationing and Euthanasia – Disputed! and Fiction! Don Wildmon of the American Family Association (eRumor example #3) warned that Health Care Bill this could be the next next step towards euthanasia.   Assisted suicide and euthanasia are not mentioned in the text of the bill and differ greatly from hospice care.   Both private medical insurance policies and the proposed Universal Health Care plan have set limitations of coverage and deductibles could be be defined as the “rationing” of benefits. Another eRumor includes a long list of concerns from the organization Family Security Matters. (eRumor Example #2) Pg 22 of the HC Bill mandates the Government will audit books of all employers that self insure. – A Matter of Interpretation! The text of the bill reads, “The Commissioner, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor Secretary of Labor, shall conduct a study of the large group insured and self-insured employer health care markets.”  There is no mention of  audits. Pg 30 Sec 123 of HC bill — a Government committee (good luck with that!) will decide what treatments/benefits a person may receive. – Fiction! The text of the bill reads” IN GENERAL.—There is established a private-public advisory committee which shall be a panel of medical and other experts to be known as the Health Benefits Advisory Committee to recommend covered benefits and essential, enhanced, and premium plans.”  There is no mention of treatment procedures or policies. Pg 29 lines 4-16 in the HC bill — YOUR HEALTHCARE WILL BE RATIONED! (they call it allocated) – Disputed! Rationing could be defined as the controlled distribution of resources and goods or services. This section of the bill deal with cost sharing and co-payments and annual limitations,  The text of the bill says, “The cost-sharing incurred under the essential benefits package with respect to an individual (or family) for a year does not exceed the applicable level specified in subparagraph.”   It is then defined as $5,000 per individual and $10,000 per family each year. The setting of co-payments and coverage limitations is a standard procedure for all medical health plans. Pg 42 of HC Bill — The Health Choices Commissioner will choose your HC Benefits for you.  – Truth! According to the text of the bill, the commissioner’s duties include the establishment and enforcement of “qualified health benefits plan standards”.  The list of his duties also includes the “establishment and operation of a Health Insurance Exchange” and accountability. PG 50 Section 152 in HC bill — HC will be provided to ALL non US citizens, illegal or otherwise. – Disputed! There is no provision to check for citizenship prior to receiving health services even though there are the provisions:. Section 152 is a discrimination clause that basically said that all health services “covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.”   Citizenship is not mentioned. Section 246 on page 143 under the heading of  “NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS” said, “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.” Pg 58 HC Bill — Government will have real-time access to individual’s finances and a National ID Health Card will be issued!- Truth !  and Fiction! Under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS”, this section is for a “real-time (or near realtime) determination of an individual’s financial responsibility at the point of service and, to the extent possible, prior to service, including whether the individual is eligible for a specific service with a specific physician at a specific facility, which may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identification card”   Co-payments which need to be collected are part of the plan and it also appears that the new health plan is designed to work with insurance supplement programs.  There is no mention in the bill that personal finance records would be collected. Pg 59 HC Bill lines 21-24 Government will have direct access to your bank accts for election funds transfer. – A Matter of Interpretation! This falls under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS” the bill says,”enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.”   The text of the bill is not clear if the electronic funds transfers means between the patient and the health care provider. PG 65 Sec 164 is a payoff subsidized plan for retirees and their families in Unions & community organizations (read: ACORN).- Fiction! Section 164 deals with “REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES” and says, “Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a temporary reinsurance program (in this section referred to as the ‘‘reinsurance program’’) to provide reimbursement to assist participating employment-based plans with the cost of providing health benefits to retirees and to eligible spouses, surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees.”    Unions and community organizations (such as ACORN) do not appear to be singled out in the text of the bill.   Also, non union private business that offer retirement plans and benefits for employees exist in the country. Pg 72 Lines 8-14 Government will create an HC Exchange to bring private HC plans under Government control. Was under investigation at the time the bill was abandoned PG 91 Lines 4-7 HC Bill — Government mandates linguistic appropriate services. Example — Translators for illegal aliens. – Truth! & Fiction! The text of the bill read, “CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS.—The entity shall provide for culturally and linguistically appropriate communication and health services.”   Translations Services will be provided for those who do not speak English.   Section 246 on page 143 under the heading of  “NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS” said, “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.”  This means no benefits provided to illegal aliens.

"Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarypanthers/"," According to the eRumor, in the late 1960’s, two Black Panthers were tried for murder in the death of a fellow Black Panther, Alex Rackley.  Rackley was tortured before being killed.  The Panthers who were tried, Warren Kimbro and Erica Huggins, escaped prosecution thanks, in part, to the defense of Hillary Clinton.  Warren Kimbro went on to Harvard and became Assistant Dean of Eastern Connecticut State College.  Erica Huggins was elected to a school board. "," This eRumor has developed a life of its own with differing interpretations of what is true or not true about it. It circulated widely during Hillary Rodham Clinton’s year 2000 run for the U.S. Senate. According to published accounts, Alex Rackley was a Panther recruit from New York who was tortured and killed in New Haven, Connecticut because he was suspected of being a police informant.  Twelve Panthers were indicted including Warren Kimbro, Erica Huggins, and Panther leader Bobby Seale.  Contrary to the email, Kimbro was not proven to be the “shooter” and did not stand trial, but did plead guilty to second degree murder.  He was later released from prison and admitted to Harvard.  We have not found evidence that he was a college dean.  Another Panther was convicted of having fired the fatal shot and was sentenced to life in prison.  Huggins and Seale were tried together, but the jury deadlocked and their cases were dismissed. The Bobby Seales trial drew protests, not because the protestors approved of murder, but they felt that the Panthers were being treated unfairly by the authorities and that Seales, who was not personally involved in the killing, should not have been tried.  There were demonstrations at Yale, but they were  peaceful, did not “shut down” the university. Hillary was not an attorney at that time (which is what some of the versions of this email seem to suggest), but a student at Yale and, according to Roger Morris, author of PARTNERS IN POWER, helped organize shifts of students to monitor the courtroom. John Elvin of Insight magazine looked into the Hillary-Panthers eRumor as well as how it was handled by some urban legends sites and wrote his findings in an article that appeared in July of 2000.  He quotes former sixties radical David Horowitz as saying that both Hillary Rodham and Bill Lann Lee organized demonstrations at Yale against the Panther trial.  Elvin also says, “Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, Brock and Roger Morris for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as Barbara Olson’s Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back Horowitz’s contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests.” Conservative commentator Joseph Farah says she also assisted Seales’ lawyer, Charles Garry. That was all a long time ago and most of us would not want to be characterized by our views and activities in college or graduate school, but, for whatever it’s worth, they do become a part of our story.

"," Claims that President Obama supports the Islamic State and doesn’t recognize Israel are not supported by facts and cannot be proven as truth or fiction. This eRumor accurately describes the region along the Mediterranean Sea that has historically been called the Levant. The Levant refers to modern-day Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. The term has also been used to describe the entire Mediterranean Sea coastline from Egypt to Greece, according to the Ancient History Encyclopedia . Plenty of Democrats and Republicans refer to the terrorist group as ISIL. The Sunlight Foundation reports a fairly even split between politicians in the two parties. Yet, the eRumor singles out only Obama for alleged pro-Islamic and anti-Semitic motivations. A number of theories have emerged as to why politicians refer to the group as ISIS or ISIL. NBC News White House Correspondent Chuck Todd theorized that the president uses ISIL because he chose not to intervene in the Syrian civil war, which some believe is how the group was able to flourish, the Washington Post reports . Another theory is that some use ISIL because there women are named Isis.

"," Note: Different versions of this eRumor have been circulating the Internet, some of them in very poor taste with photos of a naked woman alleged to be the mother of President Barack Obama.  TruthOrFiction.com has removed the photos from our example of the eRumor and we will not be addressing that portion of the rumor, mainly because they are in poor taste and disrespectful to the office of the President of the United States. Below are some of the historical facts of the grandfather and mother of President Barack Obama from a variety of sources.  We have linked them to our findings and we will continue to add to this page as more is revealed to us: Stanley Armour Dunham’s Troubled Youth Stanley Armour Dunham was born in Wichita, Kansas on March 23, 1918 and was the maternal grandfather of President Barack Obama. According to “ The Riddle of Barack Obama: A Psychobiography ” by Avner Falk,  Dunham suffered a traumatic loss when his mother, Ruth Lucille Armour, committed suicide on November 25, 1926. She was 26 and suffered from depression because to strife and conflict in her marriage to Ralph Waldo Emerson Dunham, who the author called a womanizer.   At that time Stanley Dunham was 8 years old.   After the death of Ruth, Ralph “regressed emotionally and abandoned his family,” leaving Stanley and his brother, Ralph Jr., in the care of their strict Christian maternal grand parents. TruthOrFiction.Com believes that much of the allegations of this eRumor may have stemmed from Falk’s book. According to “ Dreams of my Father ,” by Barack Obama by the age of 15, his future “Gramps” was kicked out of high school “for punching the principle in the nose.”   Obama wrote that the following three years of his grandfather’s life was spent doing odd jobs, hopping rail cars a number of times, “dabbling in moonshine, cards and women.”   He eventually ended up in Wichita where he met Madelyn Lee Payne and they were secretly married on the night of her school prom on May 5, 1940.  Payne’s parent disapproved of Dunham. Military Service When Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, Stanley Dunham enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private and was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, a little over 200 miles north west of Wichita.   He was not deployed to Europe until 1943.  Madelyn remained in Wichita where she worked at a Boeing aircraft assembly plant. Stanley Dunham eventually climbed up the ranks to sergeant and his unit helped to supply the Ninth Air Force in the D-Day mission on June 6, 1944.   He was eventually deployed to England but his role in the war never saw combat. According to a June 1, 2009 article by the Associated Press , “Stanley Dunham’s military personnel file was destroyed, along with millions of others, in a 1973 fire at the Military Personnel Records center in St. Louis.” Stanley Ann Dunham Two years after their secret wedding, on November 29, 1942  they had a daughter whom they named Stanley Ann Dunham. In the “Dreams of my Father”, Obama wrote, that the name choice was “one of Gramps’ less judicious ideas — he had wanted a son.” Tired of all the ridicule and endless explanations of being named after her father Stanley Ann Dunham began introducing herself as Ann by the time she was in her teens. After the war he moved the family to California where he attended the University of California at Berkley on the G.I. Bill.  Obama wrote in his autobiography, “But the classroom couldn’t contain his ambitions, his restlessness, and so the family moved again, first back to Kansas, then through a series of small Texas towns, then finally to Seattle, where they stayed long enough for my mother to finish high school.” In 1960 the Dunham family moved to Hawaii and Stanley Ann Dunham enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, where she studied Anthropology. In 1961, at the age of 17, she met a foreign student from Kenya, Barack Obama, age 25, in a Russian language class.  According to her page on the Biography.com website, she “married him after she became pregnant. They later divorced and she cared for her son while juggling a full college course load.”    Six months after a quiet wedding, Barack Hussein Obama Jr. was in Honolulu. The marriage did not meet the approval of the Dunham family or Obama’s father in Kenya and ended because Obama lied about his marital status. This according to a August 22, 2008 article by the Washington Post that said, “Obama seemed adept at walling off various aspects of his life. He eventually told Ann about a former marriage in Kenya but said he was divorced, which she would discover years later was a lie.”  The article said that Ann’s mother called her “stubborn and nonconformist,”  and that her daughter “often did startling things, but none were more stubborn or surprising than her relationship with Obama.” The article went on to say that the senior Obama finished his degree and graduated in June 1962. “Then, before the month was out, he took off, leaving behind his still-teenage wife and namesake child. He did not return for 10 years, and then only briefly.” Ann’s Second Marriage After the birth of her son, Ann left her studies to care for her baby.  Around 1967, Ann returned to the University of Hawaii and got a degree in Mathematics.  Meanwhile, across the Pacific and on the other side of the mainland Barack Obama Sr. was completing his studies at Harvard.   By now the divorce was final and  the Washington Post reported that she had met and married another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro.  Ann and Barack Jr., who about this time got the nick name of Barry, moved with him to his home country, Indonesia. Transgendered Nanny Sometime in1969, the Soetoro’s hired a nanny named Evie.   According to a March 8, 2012 article by the New York Daily News, Evie “was born male but considers herself a woman.”  The article said, “Evie started caring for 8-year-old ‘Barry’ Obama in 1969 when he lived in Indonesia’s capital with his mother, Ann Dunham, who had arrived in the country two years earlier after marrying her second husband, Indonesian Lolo Soetoro.”   The article went on to say that,” Evie played with Obama and picked him up from school. She worked in the home as a man and says she never let young Barry see her in women’s clothes, though neighbors remember seeing her leave the home in the evening dressed in drag.” Posted 02/21/14 ","Politics"

"Hillary Clinton’s former boss says he fired her from an investigative position because she was a “liar” and “unethical”-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-watergate/"," As a 27-year-old working on the Watergate investigation in the 1970s, Hillary Rodham Clinton was “fired” from her position for being a “liar” and “unethical”. "," It’s true that Hillary Clinton’s ex-boss has accused her of being a “liar” and “unethical” during the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment inquiry into Watergate, but claims that she was fired for those reasons are false. Claims that Hillary Clinton had been fired from the impeachment inquiry first went viral during her 2008 presidential bid. A column written by Dan Calabrese, the founder of Northstar Writers Group , appeared in countless forwarded emails, and the eRumor was born. The column was inspired by statements made by Jerry Zeifman, a Democrat who served as counsel and chief of staff for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation. Zeifman’s book, “Hillary’s Pursuit of Power,” and comments that he made on his website, which is no longer active, have been critical of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s actions during the Watergate investigation, and in the years that followed. Jerry Zeifman said he supervised Hillary Rodham Clinton as she worked on the team that worked on the Watergate impeachment inquiry, and that during the investigation Hillary Clinton had “…engaged in a variety of self-serving, unethical practices in violation of House rules.” Specifically, Jerry Zeifman said Hillary Rodham Clinton and others wanted Richard Nixon to remain in office so Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy would have a better chance of being elected president. Zeifman said a young lawyer who shared an office with Clinton came to him in August of 1974 to apologize that he and Clinton had lied to him. The lawyer, John Labovitz, is quoted as saying that he was dismayed with “…her erroneous legal opinions and efforts to deny Nixon representation by counsel — as well as an unwillingness to investigate Nixon.” Jerry Zeifman also said that Hillary Rodham Clinton regularly consulted with Ted Kennedy’s chief political strategist, which was a violation of House rules. Zeifman said in addition to helping Ted Kennedy win the presidency, Democrats also didn’t want Nixon to face an impeachment trial because they feared he might bring up abuses of office by President John Kennedy as part of his defense. But while Jerry Zeifman has been consistent in his criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s work on the Watergate investigation, circumstances surrounding her termination are less clear. In a 1999 interview with the Scripps Howard News Service, Zeifman said he didn’t have the power to fire Clinton, or else he would have: “Zeifman does not have flattering memories of Rodham’s work on the committee. ‘If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her,’ he said. Zeifman said Rodham sparked a bitter battle among Democrats by recommending the Judiciary Committee deny Nixon’s lawyers the right to attend the closed-door meetings. ‘Can you imagine that? This was a committee of lawyers and members of the bar, and she was saying the committee should deny the president representation,’ he said. After a lengthy behind-the-scenes debate, Zeifman said the committee decided Nixon’s lawyers could attend.” In an interview on the Neal Boortz Show in 2008, Jerry Zeifman altered his claim about Hillary’s termination from the Watergate investigation: “Well, let me put it this way: I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were — were no longer needed, and advised her that I would not — could not — recommend her for any further positions.” When pressed, Zeifman said he couldn’t recommend Hillary Rodham Clinton for future positions, “Because of her unethical conduct.” Despite that, however, Clinton was terminated because she was “no longer needed” — not because she had lied, according to Zeifman’s own account. But in a 2008 column Zeifman wrote, “My own reaction was of regret, when I terminated her employment on the Nixon impeachment staff, I had not reported her unethical practices to the appropriate bar associations.” In 2008, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign replied to Zeifman’s claims directly by saying , “In a column circulating on the Internet Jerry Zeifman alleges that Hillary was fired from her job on the House Judiciary Committee in the 1970s. This is false. Hillary was not fired.” That website has since been taken offline. Posted  04/7/08  Updated 02/17/15 ","Politics"

"Bill Clinton’s Military Career-Disputed!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-draft-dodger/"," This is a forwarded email that alleged former President Bill Clinton was a draft dodger and was the first pardoned federal felon ever to serve as President of the United States. "," Bill Clinton was never charged with felony draft evasion so he was never given pardon. That part of the eRumor is Fiction. The rest of the rumor, that Bill Clinton was a draft dodger, began when he was running for President in 1992, around the time of the New Hampshire primary. His GOP opponent, George Bush, leaked out a letter, written by a young Bill Clinton, thanking a Colonel in the U.S. Army for, as Clinton wrote, “saving me from the draft.” In 2014, when the former President’s wife, Hillary, has eyes on the Oval Office, this rumor has once again gone viral on the Internet. This is what we know about Bill Clinton and the Selective Service: As the law was back in 1964, Bill Clinton would have to register for the Selective Service shortly after his 18th birthday on August 19. Clinton graduated from high school in May, and the following fall he was accepted to and attended Georgetown University, where he studied at their School of the Foreign Service. This according to Clinton’s biography on the Biography.Com website , which said, that he jumped into politics early in his college years and was elected class president in both his freshman and sophomore years. The article went on to say that “Clinton lost the election for student body president during his junior year, most likely because his classmates found him ‘too political.'” Clinton’s autobiography, “My Life,” said that he had a 1-D Reservist classification. Clinton wrote that he investigated the possibility of joining the Air Force to become a pilot but his vision was not good enough in his left eye. He also took a physical for the naval officer program but failed it, because of poor hearing. Upon graduating in 1968 from Georgetown, The Biography.com article said that Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to continue his education at Oxford University. It went on to say that “shortly after his arrival in England, Clinton received his draft notice and was forced to return to Arkansas.” By enrolling at the University of Arkansas Law School and signing up in the ROTC program Clinton was able to avoid the draft. While at Georgetown, Clinton was an intern for Senator Fulbright, who was instrumental in helping Clinton to enroll in the ROTC program. Shortly afterwards, Clinton dropped out of the University of Arkansas and he flew back to England to continue his education at Oxford and then on to Yale where he eventually earned a Juris Doctor degree from Yale.  During his time in England, Clinton was also an active war protester. Because he dropped out of the ROTC program, Clinton wrote the draft board and requested a reclassification. On October 30th the draft board sent him an A-1 classification, but President Nixon had signed into law a policy change that allowed graduate students to finish the entire year of school.  This granted Clinton another college deferment. Later President Nixon signed into law the draft lottery where each day of the year was pulled out of a bowl and assigned a random number. Clinton’s lottery number for his birthday was high enough to keep him out of the Army. Although highly criticized for skirting his way out of the draft by his political opponents, Clinton actions were, in what some might say, legal. A copy of the letter, along with a transcript of the Nightline interview with Bill Clinton, was found on the PBS website. Click here for letter and transcript. The video was also found on YouTube: Click this image to see the Nightline Interview On January 21, 1977 President Jimmy Carter pardoned the draft dodgers and made good his campaign promise to grant unconditional pardons to those who fled the U.S. to evade the draft during the war in Viet Nam.

He was not heard from again until the Taliban posted a video of him in captivity.

I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be american. The horror of the self-righteous arrogance that they thrive in.

Matt Vierkant told CNN. “Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.” Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters on June 1, 2014, that U.S. officials’ first priority was Bergdahl’s safe release.

An Occidental College spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that President Obama’s records are still sealed and no such transcripts have been released.   When asked if the future President used the Obama or Soetoro name at the college, the spokesperson said that although he had not seen the sealed transcripts he had seen a 1981 photo book that was handed out to students and faculty at the beginning of the college year with student photos, names and hometown information.  The 1981 photo book had “Barack Obama” under the student’s photo and indicated a home state as Hawaii.

The WorldNetDaily web site has reported that “More than a half-dozen legal challenges have been filed in federal and state courts demanding President-elect Barack Obama’s decertification from ballots or seeking to halt elector meetings, claiming he has failed to prove his U.S. citizenship status.” An online petition has been set up by  “Rally Congress”,  a non profit group “dedicated to helping people and groups communicate more effectively with elected officials”,  they say that they have collected over 108,000 signatures and letters.

Click for AIP release. On November 1, 2008 the Associated Press released a report saying that state officials in Hawaii “have personally verified that the health department holds Obama’s original birth certificate.”  Hawaiian Health Department Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino and Alvin Onaka, who is the registrar of vital statistics both reviewed the original document. The suit had been filed by Philip Berg ,  a Pennsylvania attorney who described himself as a lifelong Democrat, the former Democratic Chairman of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, an 8-year member of the state democratic committee, a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and a past candidate for both governor of Pennsylvania and United States Senator. Berg filed the suit in federal court on August 21, 2008 claiming that Barack Obama was not eligible to be president of the United States because he was not a “natural born” citizen of the United States, which is required by the Constitution.  He asked that the court demand Obama and the Democratic National Committee to provide documentation proving he was eligible to be president..  He also asked for a temporary restraining order asking that Obama’s campaign be halted. At issue was whether Barack Obama was ever an American citizen by birth, even if he is an American citizen whether he was a “natural born” citizen as the constitution requires for the president, and whether he ever lost his U.S. citizenship and, if so, whether he ever got it back. An Internet video began circulating based on an interview with Berg.  It was titled October Surprise and outlined Bergs contentions about Obama’s birth. Most of this is has yet to be proven but in his lawsuit, Berg alleges: That Obama was not born in Hawaii, as he claims, but was actually born in Kenya, his father’s homeland. That Obama’s mother was in Kenya in the late stages of her pregnancy and airlines at the time would not let her fly back to Hawaii at such an advanced time of pregnancy. That Obama’s grandmother on his father’s side, a half brother, and a half sister all say Obama was born in Kenya.  In October, 2008, Berg announced that he had a recording of the grandmother talking about the birth and that she was in the birth room when it took place. That Obama was born on August 4, 1961 but his birth was not registered in Hawaii until August 8, 1961 and that the registration and a Honolulu newspaper announcement of the birth were fabricated. That there is not agreement in Obama’s family about what hospital in which he was allegedly born in Hawaii. That according to Wayne Madison, a journalist with Online Journal, a GOP research team sent to Mombosa, Kenya, found a certificate registering the birth of Barack Obama, Jr. at a maternity hospital indicating his birth to a Kenyan father and a U.S. mother. That if he was born in Kenya, he cannot be a U.S. citizen because the law stated that his mother would have had to have lived 10-years in the United States, 5 of which were after the age of 14.  Since she was 18 at the time of Obama’s birth, she did not meet the residency requirements for passing U.S. citizenship to Obama. That when Obama’s mother married an Indonesian man and took Obama to Indonesia when he was 6-years old, he would have lost his U.S. citizenship and become Indonesian.  Indonesia at the time did not recognize dual citizenship. That when Obama was registered to attend school in Indonesia, the registration form listed him as “Barry Soetoro” (his stepfather’s last name), listed him as Indonesian, and listed is faith as Islam. That according to the law at the time, Obama’s mother would have lost her U.S. citizenship by marrying an Indonesian and living in Indonesia.  Four years later she returned to Hawaii and divorced her Indonesian husband.  Berg said that she could have regained her U.S. citizenship by taking an oath of allegiance to the United States but that there is no record that she did.  Therefore, Obama would not have been able to regain his own citizenship until the age of 18 and himself take an oath of allegiance to the U.S.  Berg said there is no record of that ever happening.  Berg concludes that not only may Obama not be eligible to be president, but that he may be an illegal alien. That Obama traveled to Pakistan at the age of 20 and traveled using an Indonesian passport.  Had he regained his U.S. citizenship, according to Berg, he would have traveled using a U.S. passport. In response to questions about his birth, Obama posted a birth certificate on his campaign website, but Berg contends that it is a forgery and that forensic experts have determined that it is a altered version of the birth certificate of Obama’s half sister, Maya Kasandra Soetoro, who was born in Indonesia but whose birth record was also forged to make it appear that she was born in Hawaii. That when Obama registered for the Illinois Bar he lied and said “none” when asked about any former names. Berg said that Obama’s lawyers were dragging their feet in providing proof of Obama’s birth and citizenship and that means “he’s a total fraud, he’s a phony, and that means he should be arrested, tried, and deported. An eRumor got started at the beginning of October 2008, saying that the judge in the Berg case, had issued an order for Obama to produce his original birth certificate, but that was false. An article by Jon Dryer was posted on NewsWithViews.com, which has since been retracted. In it, Dryer claimed that Judge R. Barclay Surrick had made a decision in the case and had ordered Obama to present the court with evidence that he is an American citizen. The Berg lawsuit was the latest in a series of challenges about the birth of the Democratic nominee for president, which he lists as having taken place in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. The first was an eRumor that said that Hawaii was not a state when he was born so therefore he is not a “natural born” citizen. That one was Fiction! Hawaii was a state in 1961 and it would not have mattered because prior to that it was a U.S. Territory, which would have still qualified him as “natural born.” CLICK for more on that story.

"Religious significance of George Washington and the Washington memorial-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/washmonument/"," The eRumor describes some of the inscriptions and design of the Washington Monument in Washington D.C. in light of controversy over references to God in government settings. "," This one’s got many statements in it, so let’s take them one by one. The words “Laus Deo” on the cap of the monument- Truth! There is an aluminum point crowning the apex of the monument. There are four sides, each facing a point of the compass.  According to the National Park Service, the north side lists the members of the joint commission that was in charge of the Washington monument project.  The west side lists the dates of the laying of the cornerstone, the first stone laid at the height of 152 fee, and the the setting of the capstone. The south side lists the names of chief engineer, the architect, and some of the workmen.  The east side simply has the words “Laus Deo” which is translated as “Praise be to God.” Washington DC was laid out to be in the design of a cross- Fiction! It seems to be in the form of a cross, but there’s no evidence that was the intent of the designer, architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant.  If one sees the layout of White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Capitol, and The Lincoln Memorial as the intended cross, it was not in the mind of Charles L’Enfant because he proposed the original design in 1791, which was long before it was decided that the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials would be built and where (1911 and 1934). On the 12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore- Truth! There is a memorial stone in the wall at the 140-foot level with the following blessing: “May heaven to this union continue its beneficence.  May brotherly affection with union be perpetual. May the free constitution which is the work of our ancestors be sacredly maintained and its administration be stamped with wisdom and virtue.” On the 20th landing is a memorial presented by some Chinese Christians- Truth! It is from Christians from the port city of Ningpo, Chekiang Province, Mainland China and is a eulogy to George Washington. On the 24th landing a presentation made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6.- Truth! The memorial says it is presented by the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York and from the Sabbath School children of the Methodist Episcopal church in Philadelphia.  It then says “A preached Gospel” and “A free press” then closes with “Washington, we revere his memory.” The inscriptions include the Bible reference Proverbs 10:7. There is also an open bible on the monument that includes Luke 18:16 where Jesus said “Suffer the little children to come unto me” and Proverbs 22:6, which says “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” When the cornerstone was laid, one of the items in it was a Bible-Truth! Several dozen items were placed into the monument at the laying of the cornerstone including, according to the National Park Service, a copy of the Bible presented by The Bible Society. Washington’s Prayer for America- Truth! But altered. This is an interesting one. This “prayer of Washington” is widely circulated and reflects his true wishes about the United States because the bulk of it comes from his own words. There is a certain lack of integrity with the prayer, however, in that he never really formally prayed it in the way that is circulated. Someone along the way decided to create the prayer from one of Washington’s letters and package it in the fabricator’s own religious cultural language. The original words from Washington are from the closing paragraph of a letter to the governors of the 13 states on the occasion of his retirement from command of the Continental Army and public life.  We consulted John C. Fitzpatrick’s collection of the writings of George Washington that are available through the University of Virginia Library and which includes the text of the letter. In the letter, Washington said that he wanted the governors to convey his words to their legislatures and that he hoped it would be regarded as coming from someone who always wished to be useful to his country and who in the shade of retirement would not fail to “implore divine benediction upon it.” Then his final paragraph contains the words of his benediction: I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preside, in his holy protection, that he would incline the hearts of the Citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to Government, to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow Citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have served in the Field, and finally, that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all, to do Justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that Charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the Characteristicks of the Divine Author of our blessed Religion, and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy Nation. The prayer that is circulated, however, adds a formal salutation and prayer ending, changes it to King James English (used for formal prayers among many Christian groups), changes some of the wording, and leaves out words from the original.   A blessing that was written to the governors of the states about their states and their soldiers was changed to be a general prayer about the country. We even found one reference that claimed the prayer was prayed by George Washington during battle at Valley Forge. Last updated 12/5/03 ","Politics"

"Heinz Endowments to Leftist Causes through The Tides Foundation?-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/teresakerry/"," The eRumor says that Senator John Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, donates millions of dollars to The Tides Foundation. The eRumor says that the foundation supports various antiwar groups including one that offered to defend Saddam Hussein, another that seeks to ease restrictions on immigration from Muslin terrorist states, a group that has close relations with the terrorist group Hamas, and a radical Hispanic group that advocates returning all of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Arizona to Mexico. "," This story is a complex one and each side has its own explanation. It got started with a report in December of 2003 by the Capitol Research Center, a conservative watchdog group in Washington, DC. It was quoted in several newspapers including the Washington Times and the Wall Street Journal. The report was titled “The Tides Foundation…Liberal Crossroads of Money and Ideas.” It explored the founding of the organization and a companion group called the Tides Center and charged that they are used as channels for wealthy liberals to make donations to activist causes but without being tied directly to the activist organizations. The article didn’t focus on Teresa Heinz Kerry or the Heinz Endowments but did use Heinz donations as an example of what it was describing. It claimed that between 1999 and 2001 the Howard Heinz endowment, one of two of the Heinz endowments, donated $4,298,500 to the Tides Foundation or the Tides Center. There is no dispute that the Tides Foundation and Tides Center fund liberal groups. But supporters of Teresa Heinz Kerry say the Heinz Endowments donations have been for specific projects in Pennsylvania. They liken the Tides Foundation and Tides Center to the United Way through which donations can be given for a specific group or cause and don’t suggest that there is support for all the other United Way organizations. A statement by the Tides Foundation disputes the Capitol Research Center’s estimate of more than four million dollars in donations to Tides. It says that the Heinz Endowments have given only $230,000 to the Foundation and that was between 1994 and 1998 and used solely to support  a “pollution prevention initiative and other environmentally friendly practices by industries in Western Pennsylvania.” Confusingly, however, a document on the Heinz Endowments website itemizes its own donations to the Tides Foundation and the Tides center, which total $8,116,000 between 1994 and 2004. Both the Tides Foundation and the Heinz Endowments are headquartered in Pennsylvania. The president of the Heinz Endowments, Maxwell King, said that any of the articles that charged that donations were being secretly given to political activist groups are wrong. One of the contentions of the Capitol Research Center that some of the donations are “fungible,” meaning that they can be used for something other than the stated reason for the donation. In a response to an article about all this in the Washington Times in March, 2004, King said, “In fact, by contract, every penny of our support to Tides has been explicitly directed to specific projects in our region.  It cannot legally be redirected and is the exact opposite of ‘fungible.'” So the bottom line is that the Tides Foundation and the Tides Centers do provide grants to many left-wing activist organizations. The Heinz Endowments to make sizable donations to the Tides Foundation and the Tides Centers. But there is dispute over whether any of those Heinz donations find their way into some of the leftist causes that are mentioned in the eRumor. Heinz supporters say they do not and that the money donated has gone to specific community causes in Pennsylvania. Heinz critics say the Tides organizations exist, in part, to provide ways of making donations to activist groups in secret so the Heinz contributions should be scrutinized.

"," The Communist Party of the United       States is not running a candidate for president this year. It’s official position regarding the candidates is that the party is       not endorsing any of them. It is however, conducting a strong campaign to defeat President       Bush. Since the writer of this eRumor did not identify himself or herself,       it’s hearsay as to whether a Communist official from Georgia said       the party supported Kerry. Regarding John Kerry’s picture appearing in a museum in Vietnam,       that story is true. There is a facility in Ho Chi Minh City that is called “The       Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum.” A Conservative group called Vietnam Vets for Truth sent a photographer to the       museum In June, 2004 to document the presence of the picture and to       confirm that it was still on display. Kerry critics say it shows that Kerry is being honored by the       Communist Vietnamese. Some reports say the picture is in a portion of the museum that       honors whose who helped the communists achieve victory in Vietnam. Kerry supporters say the picture is not from Kerry’s anti-war years       but shows him as a member of a delegation of Americans who were in       Vietnam because of the issue of American prisoners of war and       missing in action. Click       here for that page. Regarding Kerry’s quoting poet Langston Hughes, that is also true. In many of Kerry speeches he has used the phrase “Let America       be America again” and in some of them, such a speech on the       anniversary of the famous Brown Versus the Board of Education court       decision, he’s said it’s a quote from Langston Hughes. Hughes was never officially a member of the Communist Party, but was       a socialist columnist whose articles frequently appeared in       publications of the Communist Party USA.

A few days prior to the debate, Metzenbaum made a widely publicized statement that said that Glenn had never met a payroll (he didn’t actually say that he’d never held a real job).

The letter cites the Bible and says that she failed to “submit” to her husband and that he failed to exercise control over her. "," This letter is a hoax. There is no Pastor Roy Delong and no group in Washington DC known as the “Coalition for Traditional Values.” The story caused a bit of a stir for a legitimate organization called “The Traditional Values Coalition,” a Conservative group long founded by the Rev.

Matt Drudge published the letter on his Drudge Report web site and the phones at the Traditional Values Coalition started ringing with inquires from reporters. Laura Bush’s performance at the Correspondent’s Dinner was widely applauded. Those who were there say she delivered her lines like a pro and had everybody in the room laughing. The Los Angeles Times said she “stole the show.” The dinner is an annual occasion characterized by the White House and the correspondents poking fun at each other. On this occasion, President Bush took the microphone and delivered a couple of humorous lines and was in the middle of telling a joke when he was interrupted by a pre-arranged voice from the audience that heckled, “Not that old joke—-not again.” Laura Bush stepped up to the microphone, nudged George Bush aside, and started a stand-up routine that joked about her husband, the Bush family, and their ranch in Texas. Some excerpts: “George always says he’s delighted to come to these press dinners. Baloney. He’s usually in bed by now. I said to him the other day, ‘George, if you really want to end tyranny in the world, you’re going to have to stay up later.’ “ “A typical White House evening goes like this.  Nine o’clock, Mr. Excitement here is sound asleep, and I’m watching ‘Desperate Housewives’ — with Lynne Cheney.

"George W. Bush a deserter from the military?-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bush-desert/"," The eRumor asks the question of why George W. Bush was not prosecuted for desertion from the military during his time of service.  It suggests that perhaps his father, George H. Bush, played a role in preventing it. "," Mr. Bush’s critics are describing him as a deserter, an officer who went AWOL. His defenders say that it’s exaggeration to equate him with active duty personnel who desert their post, say good bye to the military, and go into hiding. Getting a clear picture is difficult, although there are some records of his military service that have been released. George W. Bush’s military service has been a controversy in each of his elections. The current controversy all got started with an investigation by the Boston Globe newspaper. The Globe concluded that Mr. Bush was an excellent National Guard pilot who served portions of his six-year commitment by putting in more active-duty time than required, but there is a year toward the end of his time of service during which there are no records of his having shown up for required meetings and drills. The Globe also explored the question of whether he got into the National Guard through strings pulled for him as the son of a U.S. Congressman. The article concludes that he did benefit from favored treatment on more than one occasion. In May of 1968 Mr. Bush enlisted and was chosen for training as an Air Force pilot. Critics have noted that he got into pilot training despite poor initial testing, suggesting that someone on the inside helped move him to the top of the list. The Globe interviewed National Guard officials who said it was because few National Guard enlistees were willing to commit to the required 18 months of flight training and that put them higher on the list. In November of 1969, the future president completed flight training and was assigned to become an F-102 fighter pilot assigned to Ellington Air Force Base. Until his fifth year of National Guard duty, there is no question about his service. The Globe says those who served with Mr. Bush regarded him as a top pilot and that he spent more time on active duty than was minimally required for reservists. In the first four years of of his six-year commitment, he spent the equivalent of 21 months on duty. In May of 1972, George W. Bush moved to Alabama to help in a U.S. Senate campaign and requested permission to serve in a unit in that state. His superiors, however, later said they did not approve of that unit because the unit didn’t do much. There were virtually no drills or exercises. The unit’s commander told the Boston Globe that it had no airplanes and essentially met one weeknight per month. The Globe says that months apparently went by without resolution to Mr. Bush’s status and, therefore, no guard duty. Technically, without new orders, he was still a part of his unit in Texas, but he was living in Alabama. Mr. Bush was eventually assigned to a unit in Montgomery. One of the superior officers there told the Globe he could not remember George Bush serving there.  But in 2004, he told reporters that he never intended for that statement to mean that Mr. Bush hadn’t served. He was simply saying he didn’t recall his being there.. During that time, Bush failed to take his annual pilot’s physical examination and was removed from flight status. A Bush spokesman told the Globe that Mr. Bush does recall doing some duty in Alabama. On another occasion, a representative for the president said that Bush made up for any time that was lost by participating in other drills. But his service records show about a year in which there is no report of duty. From May to July of 1973, the records show that Mr. Bush did log 36 days of active duty.  He was granted an honorable discharge in October of 1973. The records for July, August and September have not been found and officials say they were inadvertently destroyed. The New York Times looked into the allegations in 2002 and concluded that the time Mr. Bush missed had been made up satisfactorily and that his records showed his having performed all the required service. George Magazine looked into the story as well and concluded that there were two documents in George Bush’s records that indicated that he accumulated 56 points toward his required minimum of 50 points necessary to be regarded as a guardsman at the time that is in question. In 2004, the issue flared again during the presidential primary season. The White House released pay stubs from the Alabama years, saying it was proof that he served. Critics said that was only proof that he got paid, which was never in dispute, not that he actually served. In July, 2004, the Pentagon released newly discovered records from the Alabama year, but they, like the previous records, did not include July through September and did not shed any light on those months. In September, 2004, CBS reported on some newly discovered memos including one from Col. Walter “Buck” Staudt that said openly that Bush sought special favors in the National Guard and did not fulfill his service. There were immediate questions, however, about the authenticity of the memos. Typography experts said the documents appeared to have been created on equipment that was not available during the early 1970’s when they were supposedly written. The Dallas Morning News then revealed that Col. Staudt had been honorably discharged from the military a year-and-a-half before the date on the memo. CBS stood by its story for two weeks, then announced on 9/20/04 that it had been misled about the documents and that it could no longer vouch for their authenticity.

Most of these statements were during the debate over whether to use force against Iraq. "," There are several quotes. Most of them come during a time in the Clinton administration when decisions were being made about action against Saddam Hussein and amid concerns about weapons of mass destruction. We’ll take them one at a time. “One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.” President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998- Truth! This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq. “If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program.” President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998- Truth! Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. His remarks followed that briefing. “Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.” Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998- Truth! This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton. “He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.” Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998- Truth! This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. “We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998- Truth!

Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 – Truth! The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website. “Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.” Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999- Truth! This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago. She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country.  Albright said, “There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It’s just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies.” “There is no doubt that … Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 Truth! The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman. It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq. “We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.” Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002- Truth! These were remarks from Senator Levin to a Senate committee on that date. “We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! This and the quote below was part of prepared remarks for a speech in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club. “Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! “We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002- Truth! Part of a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins. “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons…” Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002- Truth! On the floor of the Senate during debate over the resolution that would authorize using force against Iraq. He was urging caution about going to war and commented that even though there was confidence about the weapons in Iraq, there had not been the need to take military action for a number of years and he asked why there would be the need at that point. “I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force– if necessary– to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002- Truth! Senator Kerry’s comments were made to the Senate as part of the same debate over the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein. “There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years … We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Rockefeller’s statements were a part of the debate over using force against Saddam Hussein. “He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do” Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Waxman’s contribution to the Senate debate over going to war. “In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members.  It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Clinton acknowledged the threat of Saddam Hussein but said she did not feel that using force at that time was a good option. “Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation … And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …” Sen.

"," This eRumor appeared all over the Internet in November, 2011 and on various political web sites but it was not found on any major news sites. The email says only that is was authored by someone named Rich Carroll but does not identify him beyond that. Let us look some of the topics in the article one at a time: First President to refuse to show a valid birth certificate – Disputed ! Although there are those who dispute its validity, candidate Obama released  of his birth certificate in 2008 and it was displayed on his Fight the Smears web site when questions about his citizenship were raised.   Critics alleged that the document was a fake, or insufficient as proof for the office of the President. This stirred a frenzy of rumors including emails that contained faked documents including one made up to look like birth certificates from Kenya. Tow years later, in 2010, President Obama released what he said was his original long form birth certificate, from the state of Hawaii.. We have a page on the questionable citizenship of Barack Obama complete with photos of documents. Click for our findings. First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner- Fiction! This rumor originated from an April Fools Joke in 2009 featuring an alleged Associated Press story that said that Barack Obama received a grant from the “Fulbright Foundation” when he attended Occidental College in California.  There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. Click for our Findings First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in- Fiction! Rumors about Obama’s Social Security Number began circulating in 2010 alleging that the number belonged to a deceased man who immigrated to the U.S. from France and resided in Hawaii.   That proved to be fiction.   This sparked additional inquires as to why the President’s Social Security Number began with 042, the three digit classification for Connecticut.   According to the Social Security Administration, “The Area Number is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office.” Click for Social Security site First President to preside over a cut to the credit rating of the United States. – Truth! On August 5, 2011, for the first time in the history of this nation, Standard and Poor’s downgraded the US Credit Rating to one notch below AAA.  According to a Washington Post article dated that same day, “the credit rating company said ‘political brinkmanship’ in the debate over the debt had made the U.S. government’s ability to manage its finances ‘less stable, less effective and less predictable.’ It said the bipartisan agreement reached this week to find at least $2.1 trillion in budget savings ‘fell short’ of what was necessary to tame the nation’s debt over time and predicted that leaders would not be likely to achieve more savings in the future.” First President to violate the War Powers Act – Fiction! The War Powers Resolution of 1973 became federal law to prevent a president from committing the United States to an armed conflict without the approval from Congress. This law requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing  U.S. armed forces to military action.   It also limits U.S. involvement to no more than 60 days.  In 2011 President Obama bypassed congressional approval for going into Libya, but he was not the first U.S. President to do so. The War Powers Resolution was first disregarded by President Clinton in 1999, during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. – Truth! The President did order a moratorium on offshore drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet after the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. The moratorium was struck down by New Orleans Judge Martin Feldman and according to a February 3, 2011 article in Bloomberg the Obama Administration was acting in contempt by continuing the policy.  Felman’s comments on the ruling were reported in the article.  He said, “Each step the government took following the court’s imposition of a preliminary injunction showcases its defiance.”  Feldman added, “Such dismissive conduct, viewed in tandem with the re-imposition of a second blanket and substantively identical moratorium, and in light of the national importance of this case, provide this court with clear and convincing evidence of the government’s contempt.” First President to defy a Federal Judges court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.- Fiction! The constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been questioned by several courts in various states in the US since it was passed into law in March 21, 2010.  According to an August 12, 2011 article in Reuters a U.S. Appeals Court for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta ruled that it was unconstitutional to require all Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty but it unanimously reversed a lower court decision that threw out the entire law. First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. If the writer of the eRumor had in mind the Affordable Care Act then this would be Truth! .  When the law makers wrote the HR-3590 bill,  the Democratic majority House and Senate quickly passed it and the President signed it into law. It is doubtful that anybody in government who supported this bill actually read it,  Buried inside the 2409 pages of the “Obamacare” law there is a stipulation known as the “Individual Mandate,” where the Internal Revenue Service will collect a 2.5% penalty from tax returns not showing proof of enrollment of health insurance. First President to spend a trillion dollars on shovel-ready jobs and later admit there was no such thing as shovel-ready jobs.- Inaccurate! According to a September 26, 2011 article in Politico , President Obama did use the term “Shovel Ready Jobs” in a plan to fund $50 billion in improvements to highways, transit systems, railways and aviation. The idea was to put Americans back to work by construction upgrades to  150,000 miles of road, 4,000 miles of train tracks, 150 miles of airport runways and the nation’s air traffic control system. Political reported that experts did not see the jobs being as shovel ready as one would think as ” A tremendous amount of money and time is needed to get a project through a detailed design process, permitting, environmental hurdles, public hearings and land acquisition.” First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.- Under Investigation First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.

They now may be able to stay in the country. There are currently 300,000 deportation cases making their way through the federal immigration courts, but under the new policy immigrants classified as low-priority cases could be granted a stay and a chance to apply for a work permit.” First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to terminate Americas ability to put a man in space. Fiction! According to the St. Petersburg Times PolitiFact Check site, “Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of “first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space” — not Obama.”  The Apollo program ended in 1975 and had a five year gap in space launches until the Space Shuttle program was in full operation. First President to encourage racial discrimination and intimidation at polling places. – Unproven! On November 4, 2008 Black Panthers were spotted outside a polling place in Philadelphia, PA.  One of the Black Panthers was holding a night stick.   A YouTube Video taken by a local journalism student of an account with them went viral on the Internet and news outlets.  A short time later, police arrived on the scene and they were removed from the scene.  Charges of voter intimidation were charged but they were dropped by the Justice Department under the leadership of Eric Holder, according to an August 20, 2009  article in the Wall Street Journal.  No explanation was given by Holder or anyone at the Department of Justice.  The accusation that the President encouraged this incident remains unproven. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.- Truth!

On April 20, 2011 the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint against the Boeing claiming that the aircraft manufacturer opened up a second 787 Dreamliner production line in South Carolina in retaliation against the union.  South Carolina is a “right to work state.” On  September 23, 2011 Politico.com reported that , “An Obama appointee is now asking a judge to order Boeing to relocate all 787 Dreamliner production to Washington state — a move that’s feeding the GOP narrative that Obama’s Big Government is meddling with job creation, just as the first plane nears its first commercial flight.” First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN)- Fiction! The oath of the President of the United States does not have any conditions to protect U.S. States.   The oath of office is in the U.S. Constitution and it says, “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” First President to withdraw an existing coal permit that had been properly issued years ago.- Under Investigation First President to fire an inspector general of Ameri-corps for catching one of his friends in a corruption case.- Under Investigation First President to appoint 45 Czars to replace elected officials in his office.- Under Investigation First President to golf 73 separate times in his first two and a half years in office.- Inaccurate! According to a June 26, 2011 White House Dossier article, written by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler, President Obama played his 75th golf game since being sworn into office.  No doubt at the time of this writing the number is greater. According to an October 24, 2009 article in Politico , Obama was in office about 10 months when he played his 24th golf game, tying his predecessor, G. W. Bush, for the number of golf games.  It took Bush almost 3 years to play that number of games. First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records . – Fiction! There are no U.S. laws stating that a U.S. President or presidential candidate disclose his medical or educational background.   In his books, Barack Obama wrote about his life in Indonesia.  Questions about Obama’s travels could have been sparked by a  rumor that was spread on YouTube by Reverend James Manning of the ATLAH church in Harlem.  Manning alleged that Obama, while attending Columbia University (Class of 1983), was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to be the operative in an arms deal with the Taliban. Manning said that Obama was selected because he was fluent in Farsi and Middle Eastern customs.   President only speaks English fluently, has never learned Farsi and the Taliban did not exist until 1989. First President to win a Nobel Peace Prize for doing NOTHING to earn it. Disputed! The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Barack Obama on October 9, 2009 after he had been in office approximately 9 months. According to the Nobel Peace Prize website Obama was awarded this, “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”.  On January 20, 2010 Britain’s The Guardian released a timeline showing the major events during the President’s fist year in office.    In April 2009, Obama flew to England for the G-20 conference where he not only met with Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Gordon Brown but also met with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to discuss U.S. and Russian relations. First President to coddle American enemies while alienating Americas allies- Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to.

Obama did travel overseas and during his speeches make apologies for past American policies and arrogance.  Former George W. Bush campaign manager, Karl Rove wrote an opinion on April 23, 2009 in the Wall Street Journal calling the Presidents trip an “Apology Tour”. In a  June 17, 2009 Human Events article, attributed to Niles Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative newspaper listed ten apologies by President Obama: 1 . Apology to Europe: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In America, there’s a failure to appreciate Europe‘s leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.” 2. Apology to the Muslim world: Interview with Al Arabiya, January 27. “My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.” 3. Apology to the Summit of the Americas: Address to the Summit of the Americas, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, April 17. “While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms.” 4. Apology at the G-20 Summit of World Leaders: News conference in London, April 2. “I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.” 5. Apology for the War on Terror: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight, that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.” 6. Apology for Guantanamo in France: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In dealing with terrorism, we can’t lose sight of our values and who we are. That’s why I closed Guantanamo. That’s why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogation practices. I don’t believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when you start sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.” 7. Apology for America before the Turkish Parliament: Speech to the Turkish Parliament, Ankara, Turkey, April 6. “The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.” 8. Apology for U.S. Policy toward the Americas: Editorial “Choosing a Better Future in the Americas,” April 16. “Too often, the United States has not pursued and sustained engagement with our neighbors. We have been too easily distracted by other priorities, and have failed to see that our own progress is tied directly to progress throughout the Americas.” 9. Apology for the Mistakes of the CIA: Remarks to CIA employees at Langley, Va., April 29. “Don’t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we’ve made some mistakes.” 10. Apology for Guantanamo: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America’s strongest currency in the world.” On the other hand, The FactChecker at the Washington Post said on February 22, 2011, that they “concluded that ‘the claim that Obama repeatedly has apologized for the United States is not borne out by the fact, especially if his full quotes are viewed in context.'”  They claim that the apology tour never happened.

Here’s a look at some of the specific claims: No birth certificates have been provided for the Obama’s daughters  – Truth! It’s true that birth certificates for Obama’s daughters have not been made public. The Washington Post reports that presidential administrations have “long been protective of first family’s minor children” and that it’s considered taboo to report on or photograph the underage children of any U.S. president. None of Obama’s former girlfriends  have come forward – Fiction! Author David Maraniss chronicled relationships that the president had with Genevieve Cook and Alex McNear in the 1980s in his book “ The Story .” Excerpts from Cook’s diaries from that time have also been widely published. Accusations about Barack and  Michelle Obama meeting, marriage – Fiction! Barack and Michelle Obama met in Chicago in the summer of 1989. Michelle worked at Sidley Austin law firm and was assigned to mentor Barack, a summer associate at the firm. Their former colleagues recounted those years in a 2008 Washington Post report . The Obamas married in Chicago in 1992 with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. officiating the ceremony. Concrete information about who was in the wedding party couldn’t be found. Photos indicate that Barack’s half-brother, Malik, and Michelle’s brother, Craig Robinson, may have stood up in the wedding. Nobody from Columbia recalls Obama – Fiction! Obama said he was “painfully alone and really not focused on anything” during his time at Columbia from 1981-1983, the Wall Street Journal reports . However, claims that nobody remembers the president during that time are false. Obama’s roommate at Columbia reflected on his time living with the future president in a 2009 campus publication. Columbia has also acknowledged the president as an alumnus of the university. Questions about the bar exam, law license – Fiction! Both Barack and Michelle Obama were licensed to practice law in Illinois, according records held by the Illinois Supreme Court Registration & Disciplinary Commission (ARDC) of the Illinois Supreme Court. Barack was licensed in December 1991, and Michelle was licensed in May 1989. Those records don’t indicate that any disciplinary action was taken against Barack or Michelle. Barack’s status is listed as “retired” and Michelle’s status is listed as “voluntarily inactive.” Posted 11/04/14 ","Politics"
"President Obama Snaps at Military Brass – Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:39:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-snap/"," A viral email alleges that President Obama snapped at military brass during a briefing in September 2014 and told them not to “try to paint all of Islam with the same brush” in response to airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. "," There’s no evidence to prove or disprove the claim that President Obama snapped at military brass during a briefing about airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. The email’s claims appear to have originated in a blog posted at the personal website of author DW Ulsterman. The blog post recounts the same claims at the eRumor without citing a source, so its claims cannot be proven or disproven. The eRumor’s claim that President Obama traveled to Camp David on September 19, 2014, is true, USA Today reports . But it’s not known, however, whether or not the president held an “informal briefing” with pentagon officials before his departure. The eRumor’s claim that military advisors had in some way tried to “paint all of Islam with the same brush” doesn’t appear to jibe with actual events. National Security Advisor Susan Rice said in a press briefing on September 19, 2014, that plans were to  “go on the offensive against ISIL” with coalition airstrikes and ground support provided by Iraqi Security Forces, Kurdish Security Forces and Syrian opposition forces. The military’s willingness to partner with those forces to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group contradicts the eRumor’s claim that all of Islam had been painted with the same brush.

Franklin Roosevelt was the only president elected to a third term. His fifth cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, was vice  president when William McKinley was assassinated in 1901,who was six  months into his second term.

"Jesus named the Antichrist—and it’s Barack Obama-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-antichrist-video/"," A video on the Internet from an unnamed person that suggests that a behind-the-scenes look at the languages Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew reveals that in the Bible in Luke 10:18, Jesus may have revealed the name of the Antichrist. The video suggests that it’s Barack Obama. "," The Antichrist, according to many Christian teachers, is a person who will fulfill Biblical prophesy by becoming a powerful leader in the world but will be an evil ruler, a false messiah, a person who is either against or the opposite of Jesus Christ. TuthOrFiction.com has not found any scholar of Greek, Aramaic, or Hebrew who can vouch for the interpretation of Luke 10:18 pointing to Barack Obama. The video is based entirely on the verse in Luke 10:18 , in which Jesus says, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” KJV The video says that the words in the verse were translated into English from the Greek New Testament, but were spoken by Jesus in Aramaic. It also says that Aramaic is “the most ancient form of Hebrew.” It goes on to say that the Hebrew word for “lightning” is “baraq.” Then the video goes to the book if Isaiah in the Bible, chapter 14:14 where Satan is quoted as saying “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high.” According to the video, there are several references to Satan as having fallen from the “heights” or the “heavens” and that the Hebrew word used for heights is “bamah.” Further, according to the video, there are conditions in Hebrew in which “bamah” would have sometimes been pronounced “U-bamah” or “O-bamah” and would have been translated literally as “Lightening from the heights.” Therefore “Baraq U-Bamah” or “O-bamah.” To get some insight into these claims, TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Tom Finley, Professor of Old Testament and Semitics and Chair, Old Testament and Semitics Department at Talbot Theological Seminary in La Mirada , California . Let’s look at them one at a time: Dr. Finley says that most scholars agree that Jesus probably spoke and taught in Aramaic, but that there is debate on that topic. He did point out that it is not accurate to say that “Aramaic is the most ancient form of Hebrew?” Not at all. According to Dr. Finley, Hebrew and Aramaic are two distinct languages, although closely related. He confirmed that the word for lightning is indeed “baraq” in Hebrew. In Aramaic it’s “beraq.” Dr. Finley said that in Hebrew “bama” means “back,” “hill,” or “high place, place of worship” (Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament). In Isaiah 14:14 the term refers to “the heights of the clouds” (KJV) or “the back of a cloud” (a Jewish translation called Tanakh) or “the tops of the clouds” (NRSV). However, he said that the normal word for “heavens” in Hebrew is “shamayim,” and that is the word used in Isaiah 14:12 (“How you are fallen from heaven.”) “Even if we granted that bama could mean “heaven” by itself (that is, without adding a word like “clouds” after it),” Dr. Finley said, “the combination that the video makes, “baraq u/o bama,” could only mean “lightning and heaven,” not “lightning from heaven” or “the heights”). Further, according to Dr. Finley, “What Jesus said in Luke 10:18 was, in the KJV, “Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” If he spoke it in Aramaic, then “from heaven” should be “min shemayya.” If Hebrew it should be “mehashamayim.” It is impossible that he would have used “bama” for “heaven,” whether in Hebrew or Aramaic. In Greek it is “ek tou ouranou.” And of course this doesn’t address how to account for “and” in the alleged name “baraq u/o bama.” Dr. Finley concluded, “Someone has been playing around with these languages in a rather silly way.” ","Politics"

Mencken prophesied 94 years ago that a “downright moron” would someday adorn the White House. "," This eRumor was taken from a “prophecy” that Mencken made in the last paragraph of an essay that appeared in the Baltimore Evening Sun on July 26, 1920. The essay, which was called “Bayard vs. Lionheart,” was later collected in a book by Mencken titled “ On Politics: A Carnival of Buncombe .” Taken in a broader context, Mencken’s quote was about the challenges future presidential candidates would face in connecting with a growing nationwide electorate: The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by the force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notions that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron. Mencken was nicknamed the Sage of Baltimore and was a well-known journalist and author before his death in 1956.

"Senate Bill seeks to regulate “grass roots” lobbying-Truth! But Overturned!","2015-03-17 20:39:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lobbyists/"," An alert from the American Family Association (AFA) that says that a new bill (Senate Bill 1, Section 220) will “…effectively keep AFA and every other pro-family organization in America from providing you information on bills in Congress.” "," On January 18, 2007, senators removed language from a lobby reform bill that was opposed by numerous citizens organizations ranging from Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family to the American Civil Liberties Union. The legislation in Senate Bill 1, section 220, was part of what was being called the Lobby Reform Bill. It proposed changes regarding what lobbyists are required to disclose and how often.  It didn’t target any particular types of organizations, such as pro-life or pro-family, but a part of the bill, section 220, was about lobbyists who become involved in so called grassroots campaigns such as appealing to the general public to support or oppose legislation and to tell members of congress how they feel about it. Opponents of the legislation said it was an attempt to silence grassroots campaigns by putting reporting requirements on them that will cost a lot of time and money to implement.  They said, for example, that under the legislation any small group that sent out communication to more than 500 people will be required to register as a lobbying group and be subject to the reporting regulations.  Joining the American Family Association was Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family in expressing alarm about section 220.  In a statement released to its constituents, Focus on the Family said, “If S.1 passes with these outrageous provisions, communications from Focus Action, known as ‘grassroots communications,’ will be tied up in miles of new red tape. These bureaucratic restrictions are clearly a concerted effort to insulate legislators from criticism. At the same time, Section 220 will allow labor unions, trade associations and foreign corporations unregulated access to legislators. ”  The bill exempts organizations that are communicating directly with members, such as a labor union. Supporters of the bill, however, said that the reporting requirements apply only to organizations and lobbyists who were already required to register and who were spending a lot of money on lobbying activities.  In other words, it targeted the big lobbyists.  However, if an organization spent more than $24,500 semi-annually on direct lobbying activities, it would have been required to register as a lobbying entity and report on any grass roots activity as well.  So the mere sending of 500 communications would not have require an entity to register as a lobbyist and report on grass roots activities, but larger organizations like AFA and Focus on the Family would probably have had to register, which worried them. In an unusual alliance, one of the organizations that joined in opposition to section 220 was the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The provisions of section 220 are identical to legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate last March, which the ACLU encouraged its members to reject. “The right to petition the government is “one of the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,” the ACLU said in a statement.  “When viewed through this prism, the thrust of the grassroots lobbying regulation is at best misguided, and at worst would seriously undermine the basic freedom that is the cornerstone of our system of government.” Updated 1/18/07 ","Politics"

At the same time she got a text message from her husband’s phone saying he was OK. It turned out that the text message was not from him but from a nurse who used the husband’s phone to send what she hoped would have been a comforting message, but the nurse later called the wife and told her that her husband had actually been shot and was in surgery.

The claim that Obama lost in every state that required a photo ID to vote in 2012 is also true. Four states had strict ID laws on the books that required voters to show a photo ID to vote at the time: Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee and Indiana. Official election data from around the country proves the rest of the eRumor’s claims are false. Poll results from Wood County, Ohio , show that Obama didn’t receive 100 percent of the votes in any district there, which the eRumor claims. Overall, Obama won about 51 percent of the votes in Wood County. There also were not more votes cast than there are voters in St. Lucie County, Fla., as the eRumor claimed.

"What did Megachurch pastor Rick Warren Really Say about Gays and Gay Marriage?","2015-03-17 18:06:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rick-warren-prop8/"," A forwarded email about a CNN interview with Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback Church in Southern California.  It says that Warren disavowed support of Proposition 8. "," In April, 2009, Rick Warren of Saddleback Church in California started granting media interviews for the first time since the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Of particular interest to interviewers was Warren’s reaction to the controversy that resulted from his acceptance of the invitation from Mr. Obama to say a prayer at the president-to-be’s inauguration. Obama had been a friend to the gay community and there was an outcry that he asked an evangelical pastor who had endorsed Proposition 8 on the November ballot in California, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Several articles and emails circulated on the Internet criticizing Warren after an April 6, 2009 interview on CNN with Larry King. One of the criticisms in an article from Baptist Press was that during the King interview Warren denied ever giving an endorsement to Proposition 8. Other critics said he seemed to be backing away from opposition to gay marriage. In the interview, Warren did not deny ever endorsing the measure. He told King that during the two-year campaign for Proposition 8 he did not take a stand on it, but a week before the election he sent a message to his congregation in support of Proposition 8. Here is the exact quote: “During the whole Proposition 8 thing, I never once went to a meeting, never once issued a statement, never — never once even gave an endorsement in the two years Prop 8 was going. The week before the — the vote, somebody in my church said, Pastor Rick, what — what do you think about this? And I sent a note to my own members that said, I actually believe that marriage is — really should be defined, that that definition should be — say between a man and a woman.” That statement was softer than the wording of his message to the members of Saddleback Church that Warren sent in October, 2008, just before the election. In it he said, “Now let me say this really clearly: we support Proposition 8 — and if you believe what the Bible says about marriage, you need to support Proposition 8.” A statement was issued on April 9, 2009 by Saddleback Church clarifying the statements on Larry King. It said, “Throughout his pastoral ministry spanning nearly 30 years, Dr. Warren has remained committed to the biblical definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, for life — a position held by most fellow Evangelical pastors. He has further stressed that for 5,000 years, EVERY culture and EVERY religion has maintained this worldview. When Dr. Warren told Larry King that he never campaigned for California’s Proposition 8, he was referring to not participating in the official two-year organized advocacy effort specific to the ballot initiative in that state, based on his focus and leadership on other compassion issues. Because he’s a pastor, not an activist, in response to inquiries from church members, he issued an email and video message to his congregation days before the election confirming where he and Saddleback Church stood on this issue.” On the King show, Warren also said he had issued an apology to the gay community which critics took to mean that he was sorry he supported proposition 8. The church statement of April 9 addressed that issues as well. It said, “During the King interview, Dr. Warren also referenced a letter of apology that he sent to gay leaders whom he knew personally. However, that mea culpa was not with respect to his statements or position on Proposition 8 nor the biblical worldview on marriage. Rather, he apologized for his comments in an earlier Beliefnet interview expressing his concern about expanding or redefining the definition of marriage beyond a husband-wife relationship, during which he unintentionally and regrettably gave the impression that consensual adult same sex relationships were equivalent to incest or pedophilia.” updated 04/13/09 ","Politics"

"," Encouraging veterans to vote   is an admirable cause, but this eRumor uses false information to make   the case. U.S.   policy regarding the U.N.’s International Criminal Court (ICC) hasn’t   changed much since President Bill Clinton left office in 2000. ICC was   established in the Hague as a permanent, independent court under the   Rome Statute in July 2002. Its stated purpose was to bring individuals   who commit war crimes, or crimes against humanity, to justice, the   Congressional Research Service reports . Clinton signed the Rome   Statute in 2000, but Congress never ratified U.S. membership. Clinton   said he wouldn’t recommend ratification to the Senate due to concern   that the ICC could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and members   of U.S. Armed Forces — even if the U.S. was not a party to the Rome   Statute. In 2002, President George W. Bush said the U.S. wouldn’t be a   party to the Rome Statute. By the end of Bush’s second term, however,   the U.S. “began to treat the ICC as a potentially effective tool for   international criminal justice.” The Obama administration officials   supported several ICC prosecutions and, in 2010, “reiterated the United   States’ intention to provide diplomatic and informational support to ICC   prosecutions on a case-by-case basis.” The American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002 forbids the U.S. government from providing material assistance to the   ICC, the Congressional Research Service reports . Still, there’s no   proof to the eRumor’s claim that Obama plans to ask the Senate to ratify   the Rome Statute. Even conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation   have said as   much. “The most   significant policy change is that the U.S. now attends the meetings of   the Assembly of States Parties of the International Court,” Brian   Schaefer, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation said. “No wonder   conservatives are not paying the ICC much mind. U.S. policy is already   largely where they want it to be, and the Obama administration,   thankfully, appears uninterested in changing it.” The eRumor’s claim   that more than 1,000 American soldiers had died in Afghanistan in the   previous 27 months was also untrue.

"," There are several organized protests across the nation by members of group called Tax Day Tea Party . They used this name from the inspiration of the famous event of 1773 in Boston that sparked the American Revolution and was popularly known as “The Boston Tea Party.” According to their site, “Tax Day Tea Party is a national collaborative grassroots effort organized by Smart Girl Politics, Top Conservatives on Twitter, the DontGo Movement and many other online groups/coalitions.” Concerns over the bailouts, the 2009 Stimulus Package, the threat of higher taxes and wasteful government spending caused the group to put up a website where viewers can find local information on rallies called “Tea Parties”. So far, there have been many such rallies in more than twenty states across the country that have been attended by massive groups of people. The first wave of rally’s began February 27,2009 when “an estimated 30,000 Americans took to the street in 40+ cities across the country in the first nationwide ‘Tea Party’ protest. Organizers of the February 27th events pledged to continue on with an even bigger and better protest to follow the first. With April 15th being ‘Tax Day’, it was decided to schedule the second round of Tea Party protests to ride alongside the tax deadline.” The Tax Day Tea Party web site encourages people to organize rallies in their local area but to prevent duplication and to ensure that all efforts are within the law they suggest that organizers consult the guide posted on their website.

According to the report, the “Teabag DC” idea suggesting that taxpayers to send a teabag to the Whitehouse came from the group called “ ReTea Party” .  The Fox reporter speculated that no teabags would actually arrive at the Pennsylvania Avenue address but some nearby post office instead. This eRumor took on the name of “The New American Tea Party” , one of the originators of the February 27th rallies but they are not endorsing the effort of sending teabags to Washington.  They posted a disclaimer on their web site saying, “We have received hundreds of questions about an email circulating that urges folks to send tea to Washington on April 1st or April 15th. This effort is not endorsed by the New American Tea Party, so we can’t answer any questions about it. It is a neat idea, but things like that will likely either be held up getting scanned or end up getting thrown away due to security precautions.” Click for Fox News report on Tax Day Tea Parties. updated 03/16/09 ","Politics"

Also, the brother-in-law of House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stands to gain financially from the project. "," This viral email circling the Internet makes false claims and misrepresents a solar energy project in Nevada in an attempt to make a point about wasteful government spending. In 2011, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced finalization of a $737 million loan guarantee for Tonopah Solar Energy to develop the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project on land leased by the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada. The new facility will employ 45 full-time employees upon completion, but the eRumor’s claim that the jobs will each cost the federal government more than $16 million is false because it misinterprets what a loan guarantee is. According to Investopedia.com , a government agency agrees to purchase the remaining balance of a loan if a borrower defaults through a loan guarantee. So, a $737 million loan guarantee merely means the government could pay up to $737 million if Tonopah Solar Energy defaulted on the entire balance of the project. Unless the company defaults on the loan, the government won’t pay anything. Aside from that, SolarReserve, LLC, the developer sponsoring construction of the 110-megawatt concentrating solar power tower, noted on its website that the project would create 4,300 additional direct, indirect and induced jobs over a 30-month construction period that began in October 2013. And the eRumor’s claim about the role of Rep. Pelosi’s brother-in-law, Ronald Pelosi, with PCG is based in fact, but it misrepresented the connection. The S an Francisco Chronicle reported in 2011 that Ronald Pelosi was an executive of the private equity firm that owns a 2 percent equity stake in SolarReserve. But a PCG official said Ronald Pelosi joined the firm after it purchased the equity stake, and he won’t benefit from it because he doesn’t own interest in the fund that created that investment.

"Secret Service Agents Perspective of U.S. Presidents-Truth! & Fiction! & Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/secret-service-presidents/"," An insider’s view from the Secret Service agents who were assigned to protect the President and their families.  The rumor reveals things that most people would not know about the character and personalities of Presidents, First Ladies and Vice Presidents who served in office since 1960’s. "," This rumor appears to have been generated from excerpts of a book by Ronald Kessler called In The President’s Secret Service , which was published in 2009.  In it, Kessler interviews retired or former Secret Service agents who protected various U.S. Presidents.  Kessler also interviewed White House staff members. Generally, it is a policy of the Secret Service that agents not disclose the private lives of the First Family while they are occupying the Executive Mansion. Some of the allegations in this eRumor are accurate, according to Kessler’s book and some are not.  Let’s take a look at each one: Codenamed Lancer , John Kennedy was a philanderer of the highest order. Jacqueline Kennedy ordered the kitchen help to save all the left-over food and wine for the next White House occasion- Truth! & Fiction! An agent interviewed in Kessler’s book said that while assigned to guard President Kennedy agents realized that he led a double life.  The charismatic leader was “a cheating, reckless husband whose aides snuck women into the White House to appease his sexual appetite.”   There was no mention of Jackie Kennedy saving leftovers for the next occasion. Lyndon Johnson (LBJ)  was another philanderer of the highest order. He was also crude as the day is long.  Ladybird Johnson was either naive or pretended to “not know” of her husband’s many liaisons- Truth! & Fiction! One agent assigned to protect him who was interviewed in Kessler’s book said that Johnson, codenamed Volunteer , was “uncouth, nasty and often drunk.”  The agent said that after being caught by his wife having sex with a secretary in the Oval Office Johnson ordered the Secret Service to install a buzzer to warn him.    The agent said that Mrs. Johnson was well aware of what was going on. Richard Nixon was a moral man but very paranoid, odd and weird.. He had a horrible relationship with his family, and in a way, he was almost a recluse.  Pat Nixon was quiet most of the time – Truth! An agent assigned to protect the Nixon’s said that the President, codenamed Searchlight , “seemed to have no relationship with his wife, Pat,” and she “was an alcoholic who tippled martinis.”  When the Nixon’s were in San Clemente, Ca the family went out to play a nine hole golf game and an agent said that during the entire hour and a half game the President did not say one word to his wife and daughters. Spiro Agnew was a nice, decent man and everyone in the Secret Service was surprised about his downfall- Fiction! Agents assigned to protect Agnew were interviewed and said that although he came across as a champion of family values the Vice President “was having affairs while in office.”   A detail of Secret Service agents once clandestinely took Agnew to a room on the fourth floor of Washington’s Regis Hotel and left him there unguarded for three hours, at the request of the Vice President.  A former agent said, “Leaving him in an unsecured location was a breach of security.  As agents, it was embarrassing because we were facilitating his adultery.   We felt like pimps.” Gerald Ford was a true gentlemen who treated the Secret Service with respect and dignity. He had a great sense of humor. Betty Ford drank a lot- Truth! Agents found President Ford, Codenamed Passkey , to be a “decent man who valued their service.”  Although he was portrayed by Saturday Night Live comedian Chevy Chase to be a stumbling, bumbling buffoon, agents say Gerald Ford was quite athletic and enjoyed skiing.  Ford often taunted agents to keep up with him on the slopes.  After failing to keep up with the President the Secret Service recruited a world class skier who would ski backwards in front of the President and “wave as the President tried to catch up with him.” Betty Ford did suffer from alcoholism but eventually found sobriety and in 1982 founded the Betty Ford Center, which has aided over 90,000 people with a network of treatment centers for alcohol and chemical dependency. Jimmy Carter was a complete phony who had disdain for the Secret Service, and was very irresponsible with the “football” nuclear codes- Truth! Kessler interviewed agents assigned to Jimmy Carter, codenamed Deacon , who described Carter as a “moody and mistrustful” person who distanced himself from the agents who were sworn to protect him and his family.  Agents were instructed not to speak to President Carter unless he spoke to them first.  A former agent said that President Carter “tried to project the image of himself as a man of the people by carrying his own luggage when travelling. When he was running for President, Carter would carry his own bags while the press was in sight but once in private he would ask the Secret Service to carry his luggage.   An agent said that when the Carters were staying at the President’s home in Plains, Georgia, the “nuclear football,” the device that the President uses to launch antiballistic missiles to protect the U.S. from a foreign launched nuclear attack was not permitted on the grounds of the Carter home.  The “football” allows the President to launch counter measures within five minutes of a notification of a nuclear strike. It was kept with an agent in a military trailer in the neighboring town, Americus, which was fifteen minutes away. Rosalyn Carter mostly did her own thing- Unproven! Although not much is written in Kessler’s book about Rosalyn Carter, other than she enjoyed a screwdriver before church on Sunday in a White House where the Carters had requested the removal of alcoholic beverages, there is no indication that she did her own thing. Ronald Reagan was moral, honest, respectful, and dignified. The Reagan’s treated Secret Service and everyone else with respect and honor. Nancy Reagan was very nice but very protective of the President- Truth! Ronald Reagan’s codename was Rawhide and according to Kessler’s book he treated the Secret Service agents, the Air Force One Crew and the staff of maids and butlers at the White House with respect.  President Reagan was known to carry a fire arm and told a former agent that it was “just in case you guys can’t do your job, I can help out.”   A former agent told Kessler that when Reagan travelled on his first presidential trip to the Soviet Union he had packed a gun in his briefcase.   A former staff member told Kessler that “Reagan was famous for firing up Air Force jets on behalf of children who needed transport for kidney operations.” Kessler wrote that Nancy Reagan was very protective of her husband, oversaw his diet and all visits from the children of the President had to be cleared by her first. George H. Bush was extremely kind, considerate and always respectful towards Secret Service agents.  They took great care in making sure the agents’ comforts were taken care of and even brought them meals.  Barbara Bush once gave a warm hat to a Secret Service agent while he was protecting the Bush’s at their Kennebunkport home in Maine – Truth! A former agent told Kessler that the Bush’s were very considerate of the agents sworn to protect them.   The hat incident occurred while Mr. Bush was Vice President. Bill Clinton’s term in office was one giant party, he was not trustworthy, adulterous and was only nice because he wanted everyone to like him.   Hillary Clinton was another phony whose personality would change the instant cameras were near. She hated with open disdain the military and Secret Service. – Truth! A former agent told Kessler that William Jefferson Clinton, codename Eagle, was habitually one to two hours late for so many events that the agents assigned to protect him dubbed his tardiness “Clinton Standard Time.”  Clinton was caught in an adulterous affair with Monica Lewinsky and the Clintons, as well as many of the staff that they brought with them to the White House considered the military as “people who couldn’t get jobs.”   A former assistant pastry chef told Kessler that Hillary Clinton did not approve of maintenance work being done in the White House while they were present.  An agent assigned to protect her said that when she was in front of the press she “turns it on, and when the lights are off and she’s away from the lights, she’s a totally different person.”  The agent also said that she was sarcastic and angry at her staff and yelled at them. Albert Gore was an egotistical ass, who was once overheard by his Secret Service detail lecturing his only son that he needed to do better in school or he “would end up like these guys”- Truth! Kessler wrote that every agent assigned to protect the Vice President heard the famous reprimand to Al Gore III.  Gore, codenamed Sundance , told his son, “If you don’t straighten up, you won’t get into the right schools, and if you don’t get into the right schools, you could end up like these guys.”   As Gore said this he motioned to the agents. George and Laura Bush were loved by the Secret Service. The President was also the most physically “in shape” and had a very strict workout regimen. The Bushes made sure their entire administrative and household staff understood to respect and be considerate of the Secret Service.   Laura Bush was one of the nicest First Ladies, if not the nicest; she never had any harsh word to say about anyone- Truth! Agents told Kessler that they “were always amazed at the difference between Bush in person and the way he came across at press conferences.”   An agent assigned to George W. Bush, codenamed Trailblazer , said that although he seemed awkward in front of the microphone that he was “funny as hell,” and had an incredible sense of humor.  The agents loved to run with Bush and the Secret Service assigned its best runners to keep up with him.  Bad knees eventually caused President Bush to switch to a bicycle.  An agent told Kessler that Laura Bush had “the undying admiration of almost every agent,” and that he had not heard anything negative about her. Barack and Michelle Obama look down on the Secret Service and hate the military.  He is egotistical, cunning and untrustworthy and has temper tantrums. Michelle is a complete bitch, who hates anybody who is not black; hates the military; and looks at the Secret Service as servants- Fiction! & Unproven! According to Kessler’s book, agents said that are treated with respect by both Barack Obama, codename Renegade , and First Lady Michelle, whose codename is Renaissance . They also said that agents were twice invited “to dinner, including a party for a relative, both at his home.”  The agent also said that Michelle insisted that agents call her by her first name. There was no mention in the book of how the Obama’s felt about the military. updated 02/01/12 ","Politics"

In August 2010 this rumor morphed when President Obama appointed Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. An August 4, 2010 World Net Daily article alleged that this was a political payback for several cases questioning the President’s citizenship that were denied by Kagan.  Snopes reported that these allegations were false.  Shortly after that inboxes were flooded with emails with the subject header “Snopes Exposed!” alleging that they lied about their findings to protect Obama.  TruthOrFiction.com also investigated this rumor and found that World Net Daily released the story but the filed court cases did not question the President’s birth records. World Net Daily corrected the story and posted a comment that said, “An earlier version of this story incorrectly described a series of cases for which Elena Kagan represented the government as eligibility cases. Those cases, in fact, were a series of unrelated disputes pending before the Supreme Court and the references have been removed from this report.” Click here for our findings.

"Straight Ticket Voting Warning-Depends on Where You Vote!","2015-03-17 18:06:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/straight-ticket-warning/"," A warning not to vote straight Democrat or Republican tickets this election prior to voting for President.  Doing so could prevent your presidential vote from being counted if your choice belongs to another political party. "," Straight-ticket voting is an option on the ballots of some states in which a voter can simply choose all of the candidates of a particular party at once instead of having to vote for each of them individually. If you want to vote for all of the Republicans on the ballot, for example, all you have to do is choose the straight ticket option for “Republican” and with one punch of the ballot or one press of the button on electronic machines, you’re done. The reason for this warning, however, is to alert voters that if they choose the straight ticket option, they can’t vote for any other candidates individually. If, for example, you chose the Republican straight vote option for the entire list of Republican candidates—but you also wanted to vote for Barack Obama for president, your marking of the ballot for Barack Obama would be invalidated because you had already chosen the Republican straight vote option. So if you want to vote across party lines for various candidates, mark the ballot for each of those candidates individually. Straight ticket voting is only available in 16 states: Alabama, Oklahoma, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, South Carolina, Michigan, Texas, New Jersey, Utah, New Mexico, West Virginia, North Carolina and Wisconsin. New Jersey only has straight-ticket voting in primary elections. North Carolina straight-ticket voting is not available for presidential electors. Rhode Island only has straight-ticket voting in general elections. A spokesperson from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) website told truthorfiction.com that in states where voting polls are set up for straight ticket voting, the voter may select to vote individually or for all candidates affiliated with a particular party.

It offered the solution to the problem as taking guns away from members of the Democratic party. "," This is a joke and should not be take seriously. In our investigation we detected that some of the facts in this eRumor were incorrect. The first example in the eRumor alleged that actor, and President Lincoln assassin, John Wilkes Booth was a member of theDemocratic party. Booth was a member of the Know Nothing Party. Charles J. Guiteau, the man who shot and killed President James Garfield was a Republican. He wrote a speech for James Garfield. Guiteau shot Garfield because the president did not appoint him as an ambassador. Not much is known about the political affiliations of John Hinckley, Jr., who attempted to kill President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, but there was a Bush connection with the family. Hinkley’s father was a financial supporter of the campaign of George H. W. Bush when he ran for office in 1980. Also, Hinkley’s father, Scott, was scheduled to have dinner with Neil Bush, the son of the vice president, on the day after the attempted assassination of President Reagan. The McDonalds mass murderer was committed by James Huberty not James Hubert, as noted in the eRumor. We found no evidence that he was a Democrat. Huberty’s online biographies indicated that he was a survivalist and obsessed with Soviet agression. He believed in an impending breakdown of society, economic collapse, and that he was in the advent of a nuclear war. Because of this he had invested in non-perishable foods and an arsenal of weapons. Larry Ashbrook, not Larry Asbrook, was the man who killed seven people attending a concert by Christian rock group Forty Days at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. No political affiliation was found. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, was a immigrant from South Korea. He had a U.S. permanent resident alien status, which means he was not eligible to vote or join a political party.

In 1912 he decided to run for a third run for office against President William Howard Taft (GOP) and Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson.  Roosevelt ran under the progressive “Bull Moose Party” with one of his platform planks being the woman’s right to vote.  There was an assassination attempt on his life and Roosevelt was shot while on the campaign trail.  Two weeks later he gave a speech at Madison Square Gardens and held up this bloody shirt with two bullet holes in his shirt to the audience stating, “It takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!”   Wilson defeated Roosevelt by 347 electoral votes. After his defeat, Roosevelt sank into a brief depression, according “The River of Doubt”, a biography written by Cadice Miller.  He eventually pulled himself together and organized an expedition into the territory surrounding an uncharted river called Rio da Duvida or River of Doubt in South America.  This was done at the request of the Brazilian government and The American Museum of Natural History and the expedition forever changed the map of the Western Hemisphere.  The 1,000-mile-long Amazon tributary Rio da Duvida was later renamed to Rio Teodoro in Roosevelt’s honor.  This expedition on foot over land and on the water in dugout canoes saw lots of adventure but proved to be Roosevelt’s greatest physical challenge which he almost did not survive.

Pritchett is a former vice president of Procter & Gamble and wrote “Stop Paddling and Start Rocking the Boat” as well as numerous books and periodicals. Sometime in April 2012, Pritchett wrote a follow up to his opinion saying that President Obama “no longer scares me, he terrifies me.” Video of Lou Pritchett reading his letter found on YouTube We found Pritchett’s second letter posted, by him, on the July 11, 2012 online edition of the Topanga News : I was born in year two of the Great Depression (1931) and spent the first 10 years of my life influenced by the extreme hardships of the depression. By today’s standards my family was about a mile below today’s so-called ‘poverty level’ but if you never ‘had,’ doing without was not so ‘bad.’ Borrowing shoes to graduate from the 8th grade didn’t seem at all demeaning because most of the 8th graders did the same thing. In June 1944, my only brother, Joe, was killed in action on Utah Beach in Normandy, France during the D-Day landings. Exactly one year later, my father died and left me, my mother and my sister to go it alone… and alone we went. My mother went to work at a department store, my sister dropped out of school and joined her and I went to work shining shoes on the streets of Memphis for a dime a shine. Government assistance was not available, and if it were, I am confident my mother would have refused it because she never wanted the government involved in our lives. I mention this bit of personal history to help you understand that millions of Americans, including your parents and grandparents, grew up like me during the Great Depression and never expected nor wanted the government to offer them anything other than an opportunity. And now to see what Obama is trying to do to our country, can make you crazy. As some of you know, my “Scare Me” letter went viral with millions of hits on the internet during the past three years. I have now written a follow-up letter which I will now share with you: In April 2009, I sent President Obama and the New York Times a letter titled “You Scare Me” because, as a candidate, he promised to “fundamentally transform America.” Now, after observing his performance for over three years, he no longer scares me—he terrifies me for the following reasons: FIRST: He has done more to damage America’s standing in the world, to lower the standard of living in America, to impoverish future generations and to shake our faith in the country’s future than any other American president in history. SECOND: With a compliant Democrat congress, a lapdog media and a weak, almost nonexistent Republican opposition, he has shattered the American dream of job security, home ownership and rugged individualism for millions of Americans and has poisoned and divided our civil society with his politics of envy, class warfare, race warfare, and religious warfare which he is using as fundamental building blocks for his ‘socialist’ agenda. THIRD: Culturally, he remains totally out of touch with traditional American values. This has absolutely nothing to do with race or where he was born, rather it has everything to do with where, how and with whom he was raised, schooled, educated, trained and associates with still today. FOURTH: He has surrounded himself with naive academicians, lawyers, politicians, bureaucrats and socialist-leaning czars who arrogantly think and behave exactly as he does. People who offer no balanced suggestions or devils advocate positions and think in lock-step with him that big government is the answer to all our problems. FIFTH: He not only encourages but aids and abets in the unionization of all American industry, the albatross around the neck of the free market. In turn, they provide the money and muscle to intimidate his opponents. SIXTH: He has increased the national debt by over 30% in just three years. If re-elected and this rate of increase continues, America will be burdened with an unsustainable $20 trillion dollar debt which will result in the country’s financial death. Recovery will be impossible – America will be the Greece of 2016. SEVENTH: Given his fanatical adherence to the ‘environmental’ and ‘man-caused global warming’ fringe, he has deliberately discouraged U.S. fossil fuel exploration and production while wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on solar, wind and algae experiments. He refuses to accept that oil, gas and coal are not America’s enemies, they are America’s assets which, if properly managed, could make us energy independent within a generation. EIGHTH: He views the U.S. as a power in retreat which abused its World dominance. Therefore, he systematically apologizes round the world. Last March he whispered to Russian President Medvedev “… this is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.” Just what is the secret that Obama and Putin are concealing from the American people until after the election? With what other leaders has he made similar secret agreements? NINTH: And finally, after all his missteps, bad decision making, poor management, and zero leadership, the fact that he has the audacity to seek re-election should terrify every American. I predict that if re-elected, future historians and political interpreters will look back at the eight year period 2008-2016, and conclude “the 44th President of the U.S. allowed the takers to overpower the payers which resulted in the greatest economy in history vanishing from the face of the Earth.” Farewell, America. The World will really miss you!” It is my hope and prayer that this letter will also go viral and serve as a ‘wake up’ call to Americans of all political leaning, convincing them that never before in U.S. history has so much depended on Americans understanding that we are facing one of the greatest crises in U.S. history. Convincing them that this election will be won not by letters to the editor, political speeches or radio and TV soundbites. No!!! it will be won by those with a conviction, with a belief and with a willingness to pay the price in helping put the most enlightened voters in the polling booth on November 6. Let me end on my favorite quote which I think is very appropriate for each of us today: “TO EVERY MAN THERE COMES IN HIS LIFETIME THAT SPECIAL MOMENT WHEN HE IS PHYSICALLY TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER AND OFFERED THE CHANCE TO DO A VERY SPECIAL THING, UNIQUE TO HIM AND FITTED TO HIS TALENT; WHAT A TRAGEDY IF THAT MOMENT FINDS HIM UNPREPARED OR UNQUALIFIED FOR THE WORK WHICH WOULD BE HIS FINEST HOUR.” Those words, spoken by Winston Churchill over 70 years ago, are very appropriate for the Tea Party Movement today. For if each of us is prepared and is qualified then November 6, 2012, just might be our and our Country’s finest hour as we reclaim this “shining city on the hill” from the ravages of Obama Socialism.

Depending on one’s perspective, some of these could be good or bad points for a Vice Presidential candidate. Palin recently said that the war in Iraq is “God’s task.”- Fiction! A recent Reuters article led us to the Assemblies of God Church where she addressed a graduating class of students in Wasilla, Alaska. We found the video and the Governor’s exact words after she mentioned that her son who just joined the Army and being deployed to Iraq was: “Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right, also for this country. That our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out for on a task that is from God. That is what we have to make sure what we are praying for that there is a plan and that plan is God’s plan. So, bless them with your prayers, your prayers of protection over our soldiers.” Click here for the video She’s even admitted she hasn’t thought about the war much—just last year she was quoted saying, “I’ve been so focused on state government, I haven’t really focused much on the war in Iraq.” – Truth! – but not the whole truth! From a MSNBC report dated September 8,2008 we know that Governor Sarah Palin was interviewed by Alaska Business Monthly shortly after she took office in 2007. Governor Palin was asked about her thoughts about the upcoming surge and told the reporter “I’ve been so focused on state government, I haven’t really focused much on the war in Iraq. I heard on the news about the new deployments, and while I support our president, Condoleezza Rice and the administration, I want to know that we have an exit plan in place; I want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe. Every life lost is such a tragedy. I am very, very proud of the troops we have in Alaska, those fighting overseas for our freedoms, and the families here who are making so many sacrifices.” The actual Alaska Business Monthly site where this quote is supposed to appear is under reconstruction has not put up any 2007 issues for viewing. In July of 2007 Governor Palin did fly to Kuwait to visit the soldiers from Alaska. Click for press release Palin has actively sought the support of the fringe Alaska Independence Party. Six months ago, Palin told members of the group—who advocate for a vote on secession from the union—to “keep up the good work” and “wished the party luck on what she called its ‘inspiring convention.'” – Fiction! We went to the Alaskan Independent Party web site and found a notice posted regarding Governor Sarah Palin.   AIP Chairman Lynnette Clark did mistakenly make a statement that Governor Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party.   Clark issued an apology and posted a retraction.   We found an ABC news Blog dated September 01, 2008 that looked into the claims that she was going to become an AIP member but stated that McCain Spokesperson,  Brian Rogers told ABC News  that Governor Palin has been a GOP member since the day she registered to vote.  Governor Palin addressed the AIP and the video we found  on YouTube shows her clearly using terms like “your party.”  Palin did encourage them by telling them to “keep up the good work.” Click here for AIP retraction Click for YouTube Video Click for ABC news Blog Palin wants to teach creationism in public schools.

It doesn’t have to be part of the curriculum,” The article mentioned that Governor Palin is the daughter of a science teacher and believes that all views should be discussed in order to gain infomation.  When asked for her personal views on evolution, the article quotes Palin, “I believe we have a creator.” and went on to say, “I’m not going to pretend I know how all this came to be.” On September 5th, 2008 Fox news reported that Palin said during her 2006 gubernatorial campaign that she would not push the state Board of Education to add creation-based alternatives to the state’s required curriculum, or look for creationism advocates when she appointed board members.

According to the article she and other Alaska elected officials feared that the listing would cripple oil and gas development in prime polar bear habitat areas off Alaka’s northern and northwestern coasts. The article goes on to say, “Palin stated that climate models that predict continued loss of sea ice, the main habitat of polar bears, during summers are unreliable. She and other state officials called arbitrary a decision to list a healthy species judging by what they deem uncertain modeling of future climate change and unproven long-term impact of any future climate change on the species.” Governor Palin wasn’t speaking aboiut climate change, she was talking about the endangered listing of polar bears. Click for article Palin has close ties to Big Oil. Her inauguration was even sponsored by BP. – Unproven! According to a news report at the NBC affiliate KTUU on August 21, 2007 Todd Palin took a leave of absense from his BP job when his wife Sarah became governor of Alaska.  Later that year Todd returned to the company as  an oil-field operator, a non management position where he would not be making any decisions for the company. Governor Palin stated, “If I thought there would be a conflict of interest, where I was going to be doing any favors for one company because my spouse happened to be a union hand, blue-collar for that company, I would be the first to say, ‘This isn’t right, I don’t like it and it’s not going to happen.'” Click for KTUU story Palin is extremely anti-choice. She doesn’t even support abortion in the case of rape or incest. -Truth! It is no eRumor that Sarah Palin is Pro-Life and a strong believer in the sanctity of life.  She has 5 children and her youngest baby, Trig, was born with Down Syndrome and at her acceptance speech she promised to be a voice in Washington for parents of children with special needs.  Her daughter, Bristol, is also expecting a child.

Approved in November 18, 1971 it “ prohibits shooting or attempting to shoot or harassing any bird, fish, or other animal from aircraft except for certain specified reasons, including protection of wildlife, livestock, and human life as authorized by a Federal or State issued license or permit. States authorized to issue permits are required to file reports with the Secretary of the Interior containing information on any permits issued.” Alaska’s constitution requires that the state’s resources, including its fish and wildlife, be managed for the maximum benefit of Alaskans.  Wolves and bears are very effective and efficient predators killing up to 80% of caribou and moose that die during an average year.  Owing to dropping numbers of Caribou on the Southern peninsula of Alaska the state deemed them a “serious conservation concern,” and members of the Alaska Board of Game voted to adopt a predator management program. On September 25, 2007, Congressman George Miller (D-CA) sponsored a bill in the House, HR 3663 to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to establish additional prohibitions on shooting wildlife from aircraft, and for other purposes. The last action of this bill, according to the GovTrackUS Web site is September 27, 2007 when it was referred to House subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans.

Palin explained the need for the program as, “trying to increase opportunities for Alaskans to put healthy food on their families’ dinner tables.

"Houston Mayor Annise Parker Subpoenas Sermons-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/annise-parker-subpoenas/"," Houston Mayor Annise Parker allegedly handed down subpoenas for transcripts of sermons that pastors gave at local churches in response to opposition to an anti-discrimination ordinance that city officials signed into law in May 2014. "," Five pastors from Houston were subpoenaed to turn over written documents, communications and sermons in response to a lawsuit filed by opponents of an anti-discrimination ordinance. The subpoenas called for transcripts of “all speeches, presentations or sermons” that touched on specific topics like “the mayor” and “gender identity.” They came to light when lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom organization filed a motion to quash the subpoenas on the pastors’ behalves in October 2014. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, the city’s first openly gay mayor, signed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) into law in May 2014. HERO bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, the Houston Chronicle reports . The measure sparked controversy, and its opponents vowed to collect the roughly 17,000 signatures required to trigger a referendum vote for its repeal in November 2014. By August 2014, opponents of HERO, led by the Houston Area Pastor Council, delivered more than 50,000 signatures to city offices. But Parker and City Attorney David Feldmen said only about half of the 5,000 pages of signatures were valid. That left the final signature tally at 15,249, short of the threshold to spark a referendum, the Houston Chronicle reports . HERO opponents quickly announced plans to fight Parker’s decision in court. By mid-August 2014, HERO opponents had filed a lawsuit to force a referendum vote on HERO. In the meantime, the anti-discrimination ordinance was placed on hold. The subpoenas were handed down in response to the lawsuit filed by HERO opponents. Feldmen said during a press conference on October 15, 2014, that “there’s no question the wording was overly broad,” but the purpose was to learn what instructions were given to collect signatures for the petition. Feldman said the city would clarify what information it was looking for, and he said it was “unfortunate” that it had been construed as an effort to infringe upon religious beliefs.

"," It is true that President Obama is travelling to India and that this will be his biggest trip since he began his term in the Oval Office. On October 31, 2010 article United Kingdom’s Daily Mail said that the entire five star Taj Mahal Hotel has been reserved for “two days of his visit and the property will be a no-go area for non-hotel staff while he is staying.”   Full details of security measures have not been released but the Daily Mail article did say that the U.S. Secret service will “set up two command posts in Delhi and Mumbai which will act as the communication nerve centres.”   As an added security measure, the British paper also said that thirty sniffer dogs will be utilized during the Presidential visit. The trip to India is only the first leg of the President’s ten day trip that will cover India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.  An October 27, 2010 White House press conference confirmed that the President would be accompanied by the First Lady, Michelle Obama. The White House held a press conference on November 4, 2010 to correct what it said were inaccurate reports from international press articles about the upcoming trip that sparked a fury of allegations and viral eRumors on the World Wide Web.   The transcript of the press conference can be found on in a November 4, 2010 article by Fox News.

The President will be attending a business summit that was organized by the U.S.-India Business Council.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the President will also be taking part in a commemoration ceremony on the 1 year anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attack.

"," Senator Barack Obama was member of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ from 1998 to 2008. As a result of Obama’s candidacy for president, Trinity United Church came under scrutiny.  Critics accused the church of being racist.  Supporters said the congregation was proudly black and with a strong linkage and commitment to its African roots.  That’s a matter of heritage, they said, not a lack of commitment to being Americans. The “About Us” page located at the church’s website said the church is “Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian… Our roots in the Black religious experience and tradition are deep, lasting and permanent. We are an African people, and remain ‘true to our native land,’ the mother continent, the cradle of civilization.” It also said that it is a “congregation with a non-negotiable commitment to Africa.” (Note: In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page.) Because of its black emphasis, the church was overwhelmingly black but there was no requirement to be African-American for membership. In March, 2008, the church’s recently retired pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Jr., became a campaign issue for Senator Obama.  Controversial sermons by Wright began appearing on the Internet.  That prompted news organizations to start reviewing some of Wrights sermons of recent years and several of his statements were branded as anti-American and racist. In a 2003 sermon Wright told his congregation to damn America in God’s name and said the United States was responsible for the Attack on America on 9/11 by dropping nuclear weapons on Japan in World War II and for supporting Israel since 1947. In January, 2006, Wright termed America as the “Number one killer in the world” and blamed the U.S. for the appearance of the AIDS virus.  In an earlier sermon shortly after 9/11 he said “The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.  The government lied.” There was also criticism of Wright for praising racist and anti-Semitic Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan and giving him a humanitarian award. In the midst of the furor over Wright’s sermons, Obama issued a statement that was given to the Christian Broadcasting Network.  Obama said “Let me say at the outset that I vehemently disagree and strongly condemn the statements that have been the subject of this controversy.  I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it’s on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.”  Obama also said that he had never personally heard any of the controversial statements by Wright. Obama said that he first became aware of some of Wright’s controversial statements at the beginning of his presidential campaign.  He said, ‘I made it clear at the time that I strongly condemned his comments,” Obama said. “But because Rev. Wright was on the verge of retirement, and because of my strong links to the Trinity faith community, where I married my wife and where my daughters were baptized, I did not think it appropriate to leave the church.” Wright stepped down as pastor of Trinity United Church in February, 2008.

Roberts, who administered the oath, got some of the words of the oath mixed up. Roberts was supposed to prompt Mr. Obama to say, “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” He made a slight error, however, and the word “faithfully” was accidentally moved to after “the office of the United States.” Roberts appeared to have caught the blunder and repeated the line correctly but the President elect recited his Roberts’ original words and said, “that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully.” Just to make sure there would be no constitutional crisis, the oath was administered again on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the White House Map Room. A few reporters were there along with some Obama aides and a Whitehouse photographer. No television cameras permitted but an audio recording was made.

"," The part about Obama referencing “57 states” is true, but the quote is slightly different than presented in the eRumor. He did not say he was going to campaign in 57 states but that he already had. It was at a campaign appearance in Beaverton, Oregon, on May 9, 2008.  Obama said, “It is just wonderful to be back in Oregon. And over the last 15 months we’ve traveled to every corner of the United States. I’ve now been in 57 states; I think one left to go.”  His campaign said it was obviously a mistake.  Nobody believed that he really thought there were 57 states. It’s a stretch to say that he was referring to “57” Islamic states, but it may not be relevant because it depends on what the definition is of an Islamic state.  There are countries where Islam is not only the official religion but the rule of law as well.  There are others that are secular states but where Islam has a strong presence.  The eRumor references the Organization of The Islamic Conference, which, as of this writing, does have a membership of 57 countries who have enough of a presence of Islam in them to want their interests represented.  For example, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Central African Republic, and the Turkish Cypriot state are not members of the Organization of The Islamic Conference, but are listed as “observers.” CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama Updated 6/21/08 ","Politics"

"," We have not found any evidence to substantiate that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Leon Panetta overrode the President’s authority.   All statements indicate that the order was given on the Thursday prior to the mission. CIA Director Panetta’s Account In a May 3rd NBC news interview Panetta told reporter Brian Williams that the President signed the mission order on the previous Thursday, the 28th of April. Dialog from the NBC interview: BRIAN WILLIAMS:  When did the President’s order in this mission become real and go up and become a possibility? LEON PANETTA: Well, as you know as we’ve been- debating this issue for a long time. And we had a number of sessions at the White House going over all of the intelligence and all of the approaches as to how we would conduct these operations. But it wasn’t until Thursday morning that the national security advisor called me and said that the President had made a decision to proceed with this operation. And then later that day I received orders signed by the President of the United States to proceed to conduct this operation under Title 50, which means it was a covert operation. And we would be responsible from the President for seeing that this mission was accomplished. White House photo of President Obama and his staff watching the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden The President’s Account On May 8, 2011 the President appeared on the CBS Sixty Minutes program and told reporter Steve Kroft that he was in the situation room monitoring the mission.  Obama was aware of unfolding events around the compound and getting reports from special forces operations head Bill McRaven and Leon Panetta. Dialog from President Obama’s account of the mission on CBS 60 Minutes program: KROFT: I want to go to the Situation Room. What was the mood? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tense. KROFT: People talking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, but doing a lot of listening as well, ’cause we were able to monitor the situation in real time. Getting reports back from Bill McRaven, the head of our special forces operations, as well as Leon Panetta. And you know, there were big chunks of time in which all we were doin’ was just waiting. And it was the longest 40 minutes of my life with the possible exception of when Sasha got meningitis when she was three months old, and I was waiting for the doctor to tell me that she was all right. It was a very tense situation. KROFT: Were you nervous? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What could you see? PRESIDENT OBAMA: As I said, we were monitoring the situation. And we knew as events unfolded what was happening in and around the compound, but we could not get information clearly about what was happening inside the compound. KROFT: Right. And that went on for a long time? Could you hear gunfire? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had a sense of when gunfire and explosions took place. KROFT: Flashes? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. And we also knew when one of the helicopters went down in a way that wasn’t according to plan. And, as you might imagine that made us more tense. KROFT: So it got off to a bad start? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it did not go exactly according to planned, but this is exactly where all the work that had been done anticipating what might go wrong made a huge difference. KROFT: There was a backup plan? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a backup plan. KROFT: You had to blow up some walls? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had to blow up some walls. KROFT: When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? That bin Laden was in there? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed. And Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious. But at that point cautiously optimistic. KROFT: What was your reaction when you heard those words? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I was relieved and I wanted to make sure those guys got over the Pakistan border and landed safely. And I think deeply proud and deeply satisfied of my team. KROFT: When did you start to feel comfortable that bin Laden had been killed? PRESIDENT OBAMA: When they landed we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him. Photographs had been taken. Facial analysis indicated that in fact it was him. We hadn’t yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure. KROFT: Did you see the pictures? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What was your reaction when you saw them? PRESIDENT OBAMA: It was him. Also,  there did not appear to be any delay in the President’s decision once intelligence confirmed the location of the Al Qaeda leader.  Rigorous planning took place months prior to the mission which included the President being briefed on every stage of the mission plan as well as back up contingency plans.   Obama said this about the Special Forces team and the planning, “Obviously we have extraordinary guys. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they’d bring back to me.” CIA Statement In a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) statement to employees that was reported in the Wall Street Journal on May 2, 2011 , the CIA head wrote. “Persistent hard work produced the results that the American people expect of their intelligence service: We gave President Obama and his team accurate, relevant, timely intelligence—providing the information and insight they needed at key points as this mission developed.

At question is what was going on with Senator Obama?   His critics are circulating the picture and saying that he is not respecting the flag or the National Anthem, especially since the protocol, according to the United States Flag code, is that civilians should have their right hands over their hearts and that they should be facing the flag.  His supporters are saying that this little lapse should not be held against him since there have been plenty of other events at which he has saluted the flag—so it did not mean that he would, in principle, avoid doing it. Some supporters have suggested that perhaps the picture does not tell the whole story and that he may have raised his hand shortly after it was taken. An ABC News video, however, shows that Senator Obama did not salute at any time during the Anthem and that everybody else on the platform did. A spokesperson for the Senator told Fox News that it was ridiculous to suggest that Obama was making any kind of a statement and that sometimes “he does and sometimes he doesn’t place his hand over his heart during the National Anthem.” In 2008, a hoax started circulating that claimed to quote Obama about why he didn’t salute the flag during the National Anthem and why he did not wear a lapel pin.

The White House  photo below also sparked controversy when it was taken as President Obama was on the telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, according to a June 10, 2009 Huffington Post article. Click for article . President Obama on phone in the Oval Office President George W. Bush also put his feet on the Resolute Desk. The eRumor refers to the Presidential desk as the “Resolute Desk,” which is how the famous desk is known. The desk got its name because it was made of the wood from the HMS Resolute, a British sailing ship. In 1852 the HMS Resolute set off on a 2 – 3 year mission along with four other ships to the Arctic.  This was a mission to  investigate the disappearance of two ships, the Erebus and Terror, which left England in 1845 in search of the North West Passage. As planned, the rescue ship became trapped by ice twice which carried them closer to their destination.  Eventually, the crew protected the vessel from the elements and continued on their mission on foot. The abandoned British ship that was found 1200 miles from where her crew left her by the U.S. whaling ship George Henry in 1855.  The George Henry crew managed to free the entrapped Resolute and sailed the salvaged prize back to New England where she was sold to the American government. As a gesture of peace and esteem Resolute was repaired, refitted and eventually returned to England.  In 1878 the ship was decommissioned and Queen Victoria ordered a desk to be fashioned from the wood of the Resolute.  She presented this desk as a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880. According to the White House Museum web site, every president since Hayes has used the Resolute Desk either in the Oval Office or a private study in the Executive Mansion with the exception of Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. President Franklin Roosevelt requested that a panel be installed at the front of the desk to hide his braces and wheelchair but the panel project was not finished until after he died.   President Truman was in office when the panel was installed. Click for White House Museum page on the Resolute Desk. The best known photo of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office shows John F. Kennedy  sitting at the desk with his son, John Kennedy Jr., peeking out from a panel that was installed to hide President Roosevelt’s leg braces and wheelchair. updated 02/09/10 ","Politics"

"Obama Truth Squad-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-truth-squad/"," An eRumor stating that Senator Barak Obama, in an effort to stop the negative ads against him, has recruited people in law enforcement in Missouri to “to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.” "," KMOV-TV reported this story and posted on its web site September 29, 2008.  It said that a group of Obama supporters consisting of two prosecution attorneys and a county sheriff had assembled in St. Louis to intercept Obama rumors and debunk them.  There had been numerous rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign season such as that Senator Obama was a Muslim and had associations with known terrorists such as Bill Ayers.  KMOV-TV said that the group was prepared to stop attacks on their presidential candidate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also reported on September 30, 2008 the formation of the Obama Truth Squad and this was a topic of conversation on the Rush Limbaugh radio show as wells as programs on the Fox News Channel. According to the Post-Dispatch, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer have joined forces to form the “Obama truth squad.” Joyce and McCulloch stated, “The truth squad’s plan is to identify false attacks and respond immediately with truthful information.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch article also stated that these people were all Democrats. It is not uncommon for a campaign to use spokespersons to debunk false claims against the candidate. Senator McCain has used the services of supporters, mostly military and former prisoners of war, although South Carolina House Speaker Bobby Harrell and Henry McMaster, the Attorney General for that state, are listed in his own truth squad to assist in setting the record straight. Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, issued a statement that accused Obama of “police state tactics” which would “intimidate people and kill free debate.” In a telephone interview with Fox News he voiced his concerns about prosecutors and sheriffs responding to false claims against Obama and taking aggressive action. In his statement, Governor Blunt told Obama, “Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts – not a free society.” When asked about intimidating effect on voters, a deputy communications director for the Obama campaign told Fox news that Blunt was mischaracterizing this. According to a news article posted by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis – St. Paul, Minnesota on August 22, 2008, Bill Ayers was part of a group that claimed responsibility for bombings at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s.   Ayers surrendered to authorities in 1980 and owing to misconduct claims against the prosecution his charges were dropped.   Obama stated that he “deplored” Ayers’ actions in the 1960s and that “by the time I met him, he is a professor of education at the University of Illinois.” Critics of the Obama-Ayers relationship said that Obama has had close association with, and the support of, a militant who has never really repented of Pentagon and U.S. Capitol bombings and has actually been quoted in the New York Times on September 11, 2001 as saying that ”I don’t regret setting bombs,” and  ”I feel we didn’t do enough.” Ayers went on to become one of Obama’s most important supporters and the first fund-raiser for Obama’s campaign for the Illinois senate was set up by Ayers. Obama objects to the criticism saying that his association with Ayers was long after his young militant days.  Ayers and Obama served together for the non profit education reform organization, Chicago Annenberg Challenge.

The missionary is Celeste Davis who, along with her husband, Loren, operate Loren Davis Ministries in Kenya. We contacted Celeste Davis and asked for documentation of any of her assertions.  Her reply was that the contents of her email were “common knowledge in Kenya.” We’ll take topics in the email one-by-one, however: Obama’s cousin, Raila Odinga, is a Socialist who is trying to bring down the government in Kenya, Africa- Truth! & Unproven! Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya.  He served in various governmental positions including Prime Minister and was an opposition candidate for president in an election in Kenya in 2007.  He didn’t win but claimed that the vote was rigged and the uproar and violence that resulted took hundreds of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Part of the controversy surrounding Odinga is his ties with Islamic interests.  He campaigned for Islamic votes and it was rumored that he had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Moslem leaders.  The content of the memo was not immediately released and stories circulated that Odinga had promised that if he was elected, Islam would be the only religion of Kenya and strict Islamic sharia law would become the law of the land.  In November, 2007, Odinga and the National Muslim Leaders Forum, with whom the MoU had been signed, jointly said that there had neither been an agreement for Islam to be the only religion in Kenya nor a pact to implement sharia law.  The Moslem leaders said they simply wanted assurance to “safeguard the interests and welfare of a section of the Kenyan community (Muslims) that has undergone atrocities over the last 44 years.” Non-Moslem religious leaders, however, claimed to have copies of a signed MoU that would have declared sharia law as the “only true law sanctioned by the Holy Quran for Muslim declared regions” and “popularize Islam as the only true religion.” Odinga claimed to be Obama’s cousin. He said that Barack Obama’s father was his uncle. A Reuters article from 1/8/08, however quotes Barack Obama’s uncle, who is not named, as saying that Obama and Odinga are not blood relatives. He said, “Odinga’s mother came from this area so it is normal for us to talk about cousins” but that the two were not directly related. World Net Daily has published photocopies of what it says is the agreement signed between Odinga and Moslem leaders. Click for Agreement Obama and Raila talk with each other daily- Unproven! There is no way of knowing how often they talk, but they have met, both in the U.S. and in Africa and have had telephone conversations.  In a 2006, Odinga hosted Obama for a visit to Kenya and Obama appeared with him and praised Odinga at rallies in Nairobi.  At the beginning of the U.S. presidential primary season in 2007, Obama called Odinga, according to the London Telegraph.  Odinga said they discussed the “destabilizing constitutional crisis” in Kenya.  The Associated Press quoted Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs as confirming the conversation, which, he said, lasted for about 5-minutes.  The London Telegraph said it was understood that Obama also tried to call Odinga’s opponent, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Obama has given almost a million dollars to his cousin’s opposition campaign-Reported to be Truth! This is based on a document that has circulated in blogs and on message boards on the Internet and that is represented to be an internal memo of Odinga’s party’s “CAMPAIGN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES.”  It includes a list of donations, one of which is from “Friends of Senator BO.”  The donation is for 66 million Kenya shillings, more than 1 million U.S. dollars.  The conservative website WorldNetDaily said in October, 2008, that it had confirmed that the donation was organized by Obama.  In a report published on 10/15/08, WorldNetDaily said sources in Kenya said the money came from a series of private meetings arranged for Odinga by Mark Lippert, a foreign policy advisor in Obama’s U.S. Senate office.  The meetings are said to have taken place during and Odinga trip 2006 trip to the United States.

Obama’s full name is “Barack Hussein Obama.”  We have not found any documentation of “Muhammed” or “Mohammed” as a part of his name.   The only reference, other than the Celeste Davis email, to this version of Obama’s name was from talk show host Bill Cunningham in an appearance on Hannity & Colmes on Fox News in February, 2008.  He is said to have called Obama “Barack Hussein Mohammed Obama” several times during the interview, but he gave no documentation of why he referred to Obama in that way and eventually stopped using it. TruthOrFiction.com looked into Barack Obama’s genealogy dating back several generations and did not find anyone with the name “Mohammad” or “Muhammed.”  The senator’s father was “Barack Hussein Obama, Sr,” although some records have both of their first names as “Barak.”  Obama’s grandfather was named “Hussein Onyango Obama.”  The gravestone of Obama’s father used the name “Barack Hussein Obama.” In an odd twist of genealogical fate, researchers at the New England Historic Genealogical Society found that Obama and president George W.

"Obama Outlaws Russian AK-47 Rifles-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-sanctions-russia-ak47/"," This is what appears to be a news article alleging that “Obama outlaws AK-47 rifles with stroke of his unconstitutional pen.” "," According to a July 17, 2014, article by Fox News , Russia’s failure to take steps to end the conflict in the Ukraine prompted President Barack Obama to announce the expansion of “sanctions targeting two banks, two energy companies, Ukraine separatists and defense companies. ” The article said that the new sanctions would “prohibit American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles.” One of the arms companies included was the Kalashnikov Concern, a Russian manufacturer of the AK-47. Prior to this executive order, sales of the AK-47 has been met with restrictions or ban over the course of several decades. Posted 7/18/2014 ","Politics"
"Barack Obama and William Ayers-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-ayers/"," An eRumor claiming that Senator Barack Obama had a long association with a known domestic terrorist by the name of William Ayers who took part in the bombing of the Pentagon "," Ayers was a founding member of a radical group known at the Weather Underground that carried out bombings of federal buildings including the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s. It was in protest of the Vietnam war. Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohm spent a decade as fugitives from the FBI, which classed the Weather Underground as a “domestic terrorist group.” They resurfaced in 1980 after charges against them were dropped because of misconduct in collecting evidence against them. They both became professors in Chicago where Ayers was an education professor at the time that he became a campaign controversy in 2008. Ayers has been unrepentant about his Weather Underground activities and has been quoted as saying they “didn’t do enough.” The nature of Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers was a subject talked about among his critics during the 2008 presidential campaign, but it became a major issue when Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin brought it to the campaign trail in a speech in California on October 4, 2008. She said, “”Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country.” Supporters of Obama said that contact between the two men was not that significant and pointed to a New York Times story that said their relationship consisted of attending board meetings of two Chicago organizations they were involved with and other than that, there had been no contact between them except bumping into each other on the sidewalk in the neighborhood in which they both lived. Obama’s “Fight the Smears” web site called the accusations about the Obama-Ayers connection “phony, tenuous, and exaggerated at best, if not outright false.” The Obama site accused his critics of trying to link him with terrorism or approving of terrorism. Critics said a special investigations unit composed of Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston from CNN looked into the Ayers story and concluded that “the relationship between Obama and Ayers went deeper, ran longer and was more political than Obama — and his surrogates.” The CNN story said    that: A review of      board minutes and records by CNN show Obama, crossed      paths repeatedly with Ayers at board meetings of the      Annenberg Challenge Project in Chicago. For seven      years, Ayers and Obama — among many others —      worked on funding for education projects, including      some projects advocated by Ayers. While working      on the Annenberg project, Obama and Ayers also      served together on a second charitable foundation,      the Woods Fund, and that among the Woods Fund      recipients was the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s Trinity      United Church where Obama had his church membership. Obama praised Ayers’ book on the     subject of juvenile justice in a 1997 Chicago Tribune     review, calling it “a searing and timely account of the     juvenile court system, and the courageous individuals     who rescue hope from despair. On a September 23, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an article written by Stanley Kurtz called “Obama and Ayers Pushed Radicalism On Schools. ”   In it Kurtz claims that Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers is more than that of just having served together on the board of the educational non profit organization Chicago Annenberg Challenge (CAC) and that “Barack Obama’s first run for the Illinois State Senate was launched at a 1995 gathering at Mr. Ayers’s home.” According to the article, “in early 1995, Mr. Obama was appointed the first chairman of the board, which handled fiscal matters. Mr. Ayers co-chaired the foundation’s other key body, the ‘Collaborative,’ which shaped education policy.”   Kurtz raised a question in this article as to how “a former community organizer fresh out of law school, could vault to the top of a new foundation?”   Even though the Obama campaign had issued a statement denying Ayres recruitment of Obama, Kurtz observed that  “Mr. Ayers founded CAC and was its guiding spirit. No one would have been appointed the CAC chairman without his approval.” The New York Times published an article by Scott Shane about the Senator’s relationship with Ayers on October 3, 2008 called “Obama and ’60s Bomber: A Look Into Crossed Paths.”   In it, Shane wrote, “Their paths have crossed sporadically since then, at a coffee Mr. Ayers hosted for Mr. Obama’s first run for office, on the schools project and a charitable board, and in casual encounters as Hyde Park neighbors.” Shane talked to Obama Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt,  who told him “they have not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages since Mr. Obama began serving in the United States Senate in January 2005 and last met more than a year ago when they bumped into each other on the street in Hyde Park.” Click for Wall Street Journal Kurtz article Click for New York Time Article Click for Obama’s Fight the Smears statement CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama updated 10/08/08 ","Politics"
"Obama Lies?-Truth!, Fiction!, and Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-lies/"," A lengthy email represented as lies told by Senator Barack Obama. "," This is a list of alleged “lies” by presidential candidate Barack Obama that circulated during the 2008 presidential primary season. There were several different versions, the first having only about 25 criticisms of Obama and instead of calling him a “liar” it ended each claim with the phrase “Not quite.”  Then it was 46 questions and a version circulated that added four more to make it 50 lies. It was a very difficult and tedious process to research this.   Whoever put it together did not document where Obama made these statements and many of them could not be found. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. ( CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama ) Let’s deal with them one at a time. LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born – LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 – Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google ‘Obama Selma’ for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)- Truth! This refers to a speech Obama gave and when he did get the dates of his birth and the events at Selma backwards. It was in 2007 at a celebration of the famous Selma-to- Montgomery Voting Rights March in Alabama that took place in March, 1965. At one point in the speech, Obama described how that was the environment in which his father came to the United States and met his mother.  Then he said, “There was something stirring across the country because of what happened in Selma, Alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge. So they got together and Barack Obama Jr. was born. So don’t tell me I don’t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don’t tell me I’m not coming home to Selma, Alabama.” The Selma Voting Rights March was in March, 1965.  Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 so he was not born in the shadow of what happened in Selma. 2.) Father Was A Goat Herder – LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government- Truth! & Fiction! It is true that Obama’s father became well-educated and had the advantage in his early life of having learned to read and write. It is also true, however, that he herded goats.  In his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, Obama describes that his father herded goats for his own father, who was a farmer.  As a youth, Obama’s father was sent to a missionary school to be educated.  When he returned, according to family members, he could find little work except goat herding in his village of Nyangoma Kogela in Western Kenya. 3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter – LIAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had- Unproven! We could not find this claim that Obama represented his father as a “proud freedom fighter.” 4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom – LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya .. It is the first widespread violence in decades- Unproven! & Truth! Again, we could not find where Obama said that his family has strong ties to African Freedom. Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya who ran for president in 2007 and challenged the election results when he lost.  The resulting violence killed hundreds and left thousands homeless.  Odinga has claimed to be Obama’s cousin but Obama has never acknowledged that and no proof of the connection has been offered. 5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian – LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. Not to mention, Christianity wouldn’t allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man- Fiction! We could not find a time when Obama claimed that his grandmother had always been a Christian. If he did, the writer of this email described a Moslem woman, which would be Obama’s grandmother on his father’s side.  In a speech in 2007, Obama described his maternal grandparents as “nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists.” 6.) My Name is African Swahili – LIAR, your name is Arabic and ‘Baraka’ (from which Barack came) means ‘blessed’ in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama- Fiction! & Truth! There has been a lot of discussion about this one with some people connecting the name to Arabic words, others to Hebrew, and others to Swahili.  Regardless, the name “Barack” or “Barak” is found among Africans and “Barak” is a Swahili word meaning blessing or prosperity.  There are also related Arabic words such as “baaraka,” which relates to blessing and most agree that the name is derived from Arabic.  Obama has cited both origins of the name.  In his book Dreams From My Father , Obama describes the name in this way:  ““It means ‘Blessed.’ In Arabic. My grandfather was a Muslim.”  He has also described his first name as Swahili. Barack Hussein Obama is not half black. If elected, he would be the first Arab-American President, not the first black President. Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother’s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father’s side. While Barack Hussein Obama’s father was from Kenya , his father’s family was mainly Arabs. Barack Hussein Obama’s father was only 12.5% African Negro and 87.5% Arab (his father’s birth certificate even states he’s Arab, not African Negro). From….and for more….go to….. http://www.arcadeathome.com/newsboy.phtml?Barack_Hussein_Obama_-_Arab-American,_only_6.25%25_African- Fiction! There is no evidence that any of this is true.  The link provided for documentation is from a user forum on a game site, hardly a reliable source. Obama’s father’s family is overwhelmingly African.  According to an overview of published genealogies of Barack Obama:  His father was Barack Obama.  His grandfather was Onyango Obama, a Kenyen who converted to Islam.  His great grandfather was simply known as Obama of Kendu Bay, Kenya.  His second great grandfather was named Obiyo.  His third great grandfather was named Okoth.  His fourth great grandfather was named Obongo.  His fifth great grandfather was named Otondi.  His sixth great grandfather was named Ogelo.  His seventh great grandfather was named Ogelo. 7.) I Never Practiced Islam – LIAR, you practiced it daily at school, where you were registered as a Muslim and kept that faith for 31 years, until your wife made you change, so you could run for office- Mostly Fiction! As a child, Obama attended both Islamic and Christian schools.  In the Islamic school there was education about Islam faith and practice as there was in the Christian school.  There is no evidence that as an adult Obama has ever practiced Islam. We have dealt with this in detail in a story about Obama’s faith. CLICK HERE for that story. 8.) My School In Indonesia Was Christian – LIAR, you were registered as Muslim there and got in trouble in Koranic Studies for making faces (check your own book)- Truth! & Fiction! In his book Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of attending both the Islamic and the Christian schools in Indonesia during his childhood. He does describe that one of the teachers from the Islamic school “wrote to tell my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies.” The Associated Press reported on 1/24/08 that when his family moved to Indonesia when he was a child, “At first, Obama attended the Catholic school, Fransiskus Assisis, where documents showed he enrolled as a Muslim, the religion of his stepfather. The document required that each student choose one of five state-sanctioned religions when registering – Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic or Protestant.” 9.) I Was Fluent In Indonesian – LIAR, not one teacher says you could speak the language- Fiction! We’ve not found any record of Obama claiming to be fluent in any Indonesian language.  He is said to speak a little Bahasa, the national language of Indonesia. 10.) Because I Lived In Indonesia , I Have More Foreign Experience – LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn’t even speak the language. What did you learn, how to study the Koran and watch cartoons- Fiction! Again, we have not found any occasion when Obama claimed that his childhood in Indonesia qualified him as having “more foreign experience.” 11.) I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs – LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies- Opinion! & Fiction! As a presidential candidate, Obama certainly argues that he is qualified to deal with foreign policy, but whether that is true or not depends on the observer and is a matter of opinion.  His travels have included more than Africa and the Middle East, however.  He was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and served on several subcommittees.   He was described by his critics as the most traveled freshman Senator.  His travels have included Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan in Asia, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, the Palestinian Territories, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. 12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion – LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify – your classmates said you were just fine- Partly Truth! Obama’s autobiography deals extensively with his experience growing up as an African-American and the issues that presented him.  His drug use, he says, was “…something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind, something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory.”  In October, 2006, he told a New York Times reporter that his drug use was “…reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teenage boy.  Teenage boys are frequently confused.” 13.)An Ebony Article Moved Me To Run For Office – LIAR, Ebony has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Fiction! We have not found any reference in either of his books of an Ebony article that influenced Obama’s decision to run for office. 14.) A Life Magazine Article Changed My Outlook On Life – LIAR, Life has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Truth! & Fiction! In Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of seeing a picture in Life Magazine of a black man who tried to peel off his skin.  It happened at a time when he was being told by his mother about bigotry and when he was looking at himself in the mirror and wondering if there was something wrong with him.  “I imagine other black children, then and now, undergoing similar moments of revelation,” he wrote. “I know that seeing that article was violent for me, an ambush attack.” We have not found documentation that “Life has yet to find the article.” 15.) I Won’t Run On A National Ticket In ’08 – LIAR, here you are, despite saying, live on TV, that you would not have enough experience by then, and you are all about having experience first- Truth! After his Senate victory in 2004 he ruled out a national run owing to his lack of experience. Click for the YouTube video 16.) Present Votes Are Common In Illinois – LIAR, they are common for YOU, but not many others have 130 NO VOTES- Mostly Truth! This is with reference to criticism of Obama for having voted “present” 130 times during his service in the Illinois legislature instead of “yes” or “no.”   The “present” vote is, in fact, common in the Illinois state legislature and is sometimes at the request of the legislative leaders.  When legislators vote, they use buttons on their desks that register their choices electronically.  A red button is for “no,” a green button is for “yes,” and a yellow button is for “present.” 17.) Oops, I Misvoted – LIAR, only when caught by church groups and democrats, did you beg to change your misvote. We’re not sure what this was regarding. 18.) I Was A Professor Of Law – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Fiction! The University of Chicago Law School has issued a statement on this: “From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School’s Senior Lecturers has high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined.” 19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Unclear! We didn’t find this as a claim of Obama’s but if he did, he may have been referring to his time as a Civil Rights lawyer in Chicago. 20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill – LIAR, you didn’t write it, introduce it, change it, or create it- Fiction! It depends on what the writer of this email was referring to.  We haven’t found a quote that said “Without me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill.”  As an Illinois State Senator, Obama did help pass a major ethics reform bill.  The 110th U.S. Congress passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability act, which drew from provisions in a bill that Senators Obama and Feingold had originally introduced. 21.) The Ethics Bill Was Hard To Pass – LIAR, it took just 14 days from start to finish – Unproven! We could not find when he said this. 22.) I Wrote A Tough Nuclear Bill – LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation – mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came- Truth! Obama has talked of nuclear legislation he pushed in the Illinois legislature.  At a presidential campaign appearance in Iowa in December, 2007, the New York Times quoted him as having said it was “the only nuclear legislation that I’ve passed.”  In reality, the bill never did pass.  It died in the Illinois Senate. According to the New York Times, at issue was the concern of citizens about unreported low-level radioactive leaks at nuclear plants.  On the other side was Exelon, the largest nuclear plant operator in the nation and one of the largest campaign contributors to Obama. 23.) I Have Released My State Records – LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within- Fiction! We haven’t found the quote “I have released my state records.”  On November 14, 2007, an Associated Press article quoted Obama as saying, “I don’t have — I don’t maintain — a file of eight years of work in the state Senate because I didn’t have the resources available to maintain those kinds of records.”  Records of state bills and the votes of senators, however, are available from the Illinois state legislature. 24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess – LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens . You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books- Truth! & Fiction! In his book, Obama goes into detail about his work as a community organizer and the role that he played in the troubled Altgeld Gardens housing project in Chicago.  It was home for 5,300 African Americans who lived with concerns that they felt the city had not been responsive to.  Among them were a nearby landfill and a sewage treatment plant.  One of the goals was to get the city to remove asbestos from the apartments.  Obama does focus on his role as the organizer. 25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America – LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill. We’re not sure what this is referring to or what bill included 111 Obama economic policies.  Also, we have not been able to find this exact quote from Obama. 26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois – LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part. We have not found this exact quote from Obama and the conclusion calls for opinion. 27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year – LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office- Truth! We haven’t found the quote “I passed 26 of my own bills in one year.”  It is true that he passed 26 bills in his final year as a state senator. It is also true that he was handed those bills by senate majority leader Emil Jones, Jr., a veteran Democrat who was black, who represented Chicago’s south side, and is credited with having thrust Obama into prominence. 28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA – LIAR, the Canadian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them- Disputed! This arises from an issue in the primary campaign that became known as “NAFTA-Gate” and included a volley of charges between the campaigns of Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Obama. During a debate in Cleveland, Ohio in February, 2008, Obama said that he would renegotiate the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico or else opt out of it.  The next day after the debate, the Canadian Television Network (CTV) ran a story that said that an Obama staff member called Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. to alert him about what Obama was going to say and to not take it seriously. The Obama campaign and the Canadian embassy both issued statements denying that any such phone call had taken place. Then CTV reported that the conversation about NAFTA may have taken place in a Chicago meeting with Canadian officials that included Austan Goolsbee, the senior economic adviser to the Obama campaign and an economics professor at the University of Chicago. On 3/3/08 The Associated Press reported on a memo that it said had been “widely distributed” in the Canadian government that described the meeting as having taken place in February.  The memo said that Goolsbee “was frank in saying that the primary campaign has been necessarily domestically focused, particularly in the Midwest, and that much of the rhetoric that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy. On NAFTA, Goolsbee suggested, according to the report, that Obama is less about fundamentally changing the agreement and more in favor of strengthening/clarifying language on labor mobility and environment and trying to establish these as more `core’ principles of the agreement.”  In the same Associated Press article Goolsbee said the memo “misquoted” him.  In a later AP article Goolsbee said,  “In no possible way was I inferring that he [Obama] was going to introduce any policies that you should ignore and he had no intention of enacting.” On March 3 the Canadian embassy in Washington said it “deeply regrets” the affair, and that “there was no intention to convey, in any way” that Obama was being inconsistent about NAFTA: 29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism – LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel- Truth! In September, 2007, there was a vote in the U.S. Senate on an amendment that designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.  It was sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl (Republican, Arizona) and Joe Lieberman (independent, Connecticut).  Obama was on the campaign trail and was not present for the vote.  Hillary Clinton was and voted in favor of it.  In November, 2007, Obama introduced a Senate resolution that said that President Bush did not have authority to use military force against Iran. 30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet – LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially- Partly Truth! & Unproven! We have not found the “I Am Not Acting As President Yet” quote. This is referring to the 3/1/08 death of FARC warlord Raul Reyes after a strike by the Colombian army.  His laptop computer was seized and among the documents from the computer that were released by the Colombian government was a 2/28/08 letter from Reyes to his inner circle.  The letter said, “two gringos” assured him that “the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots. Obama will not support ‘Plan Colombia’ nor will he sign the TLC (Free Trade Agreement).” It has not been revealed who Reyes had spoken with or whether they had the authority to speak for Obama. 31.) I Didn’t Run Ads In Florida – LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks – and you still lost- Truth! & Disputed! In 2006 the Democratic National Committee (DNC) decided that only four states would be allowed to hold primaries or caucuses before February 5, 2008: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.  The Florida legislature, however, moved both the Republican and Democratic primaries to a week earlier, January 29.  The DNC voted that Florida was in violation of its rules.  The four states that were allowed the early primaries asked presidential candidates to pledge not to campaign in Florida and both Clinton and Obama agreed not to even though both of their names were still on the Florida ballot. In January, 2008, the Clinton campaign accused Obama of violating the promise to avoid campaigning in Florida because of television ads that were running on both CNN and MSNBC. The Obama campaign replied that they were not violating the pledge because they were not targeting Florida.  They were airing national advertisements that they had asked be blacked out in Florida but that the networks had said could not be done.  Obama’s campaign also said that at that time the only one of the four approved states that had not yet held it primary was South Carolina.  The Obama campaign said that it had consulted with Carol Fowler the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party who said that she did not regard the national ads to be a violation of the pledge to the early states. 32.) I Won Michigan – LIAR, no you didn’t- Truth! & Accident! Obama never seriously claimed to have won in Michigan, where his name wasn’t even on the ballot.  During a March 8, 2008 interview on the Today show, he did accidentally include Michigan in a short list of states in which he had won.  Supporters said it was a gaffe from a tired candidate. 33.) I won Nevada – LIAR, no you did not- Fiction! The delegate count from Nevada was a matter of calculation and was a bit complicated.  As a result, both Clinton and Obama made early claims to have won the majority of the delegates.  In the end, Obama did end up with 13 delegates to Clinton’s 12. 34.) I Want All Votes To Count – LIAR, you said let the delegates decide – Unproven! We have not found that Obama advocated letting all delegates decide a candidate for president.  The uncommitted Democratic delegates can make their own decision whom to support.  In Florida, though, if the Democrats were to allow the primary vote to count, each candidate would receive delegates based on what percentage of the votes were cast for him or her. 35.) I Want Americans To Decide – LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time- Opinion! We have not found evidence that Obama prefers caucuses but he had no influence on what each state decides about whether to hold elections or caucuses. 36.) I passed 900 Bills in the State Senate – LIAR, you passed 26, most of which you didn’t write yourself- Fiction! Obama has never claimed passage of 900 bills in the Illinois state senate. 37.) My Campaign Was Extorted By A Friend – LIAR, that friend is threatening to sue if you do not stop saying this. Obama has stopped saying this. Not sure what this is referring to. 38.) I Believe In Fairness, Not Tactics – LIAR, you used tactics to eliminate Alice Palmer from running against you- Mostly Truth! Alice Palmer held the Illinois senate seat that Obama won in his first election in 1995.  During her final year in office she decided to run for the U.S. Congress, but lost.  She then hastily worked on qualifying for the ballot to retain her spot in the senate and some of her supporters even asked Obama to step aside in her favor.  Obama pressed forward, however, and one if his tactics was to challenge hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions for Alice Palmer and three other candidates.  The result was that none of them had enough qualifying signatures and Obama was alone on the ballot.  Obama said he was operating by the rules and that if the candidates couldn’t get enough valid signatures, they might not be effective legislators.  Critics, including some Democrats, criticized Obama for playing hardball in an election in which he had said he wanted to “empower disenfranchised citizens.” 39.) I Don’t Take PAC Money – LIAR, you take loads of it- Fiction! According to FactCheck.org Obama has not received any money from Political Actions Committees (PAC) in the 2007-2008 presidential campaign.  There were some Clinton ads that accused him of taking PAC money but according to FactCheck.org they referred to funds he received during previous campaigns for the Illinois state senate and the U.S. Senate and before he had made the pledge not to take PAC money. 40.) I don’t Have Lobbysists – LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting- Partly Truth! According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama had raised more than $115,000 from “lobbyists” as of March 20, 2008.  FactCheck.org quotes Obama’s campaign as saying this money is all from former lobbyists, not ones that are currently active.  “Obama does not accept funds from registered federal lobbyists but does accept money from spouses of lobbyists, non-lobbying partners who work for lobbying firms or for law firms that do lobbying, ex-lobbyists, and state lobbyists,” according to FactCheck.org. 41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad – LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoo n- Mostly Truth! A campaign controversy erupted in March, 2007 when a video appeared on YouTube that attacked Hillary Clinton.  Hundreds of thousands of viewers saw it on YouTube and as a flap developed about where it came from, the Obama campaign denied that it had anything to do with it.  The creator of the video, Phil de Vellis, finally revealed his identity in an article he wrote for The Huffington Post. It turned out that he was an employee of Blue Stage Digital, an Internet strategy firm being used by the Obama campaign.  In his article, de Vellis said that nobody in his company or in the Obama campaign knew that he had made it.  He did it alone on his Mac computer and uploaded it to YouTube.  He resigned from Blue Stage Digital. 42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace – LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients- Complicated! In 2004 a paralegal from California named Joe Anthony set up a MySpace page in tribute to Barack Obama.  It was unofficial and he volunteered his time to build the page.  After Obama started campaigning for president, Anthony’s page became a vehicle for the Obama campaign, largely because of the large following it had built.  The campaign started working with Anthony on the page and eventually even had the password so it could make direct improvements.  When MySpace set up a channel to focus on the presidential candidates, the Obama campaign elected to use Anthony’s page instead of setting up one of its own.  The site became so successful and attracted so many MySpace friends that the Obama campaign felt it should have more control.  That’s when a dispute arose over what the next step should be.  Anthony said he’d hand the page over to the campaign if he could get compensated for it.  He proposed a payment of $39,000.  The campaign wasn’t responsive to that proposal.  MySpace eventually gave control of the page over to the campaign but Anthony was allowed to retain the online network of friends he had assembled for a new unofficial Obama page. 43.) I Inspire People With My Words – LIAR, you inspire people with other people’s words We have not found this quote from Obama, but it is probably referring to a flap that developed during the primary campaign when Obama was accused of having borrowed words from Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick during a speech without attributing them.  In an address in Wisconsin on February 16, 2008, Obama said, ”Don’t tell me words don’t matter. ‘I have a dream’— just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ — just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ — just words? Just speeches?”  Patrick, during his 2006 campaign for governor, said of his opponent, “but her dismissive point and I hear it a lot from her staff is that all I have to offer is words, just words. ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident,’ just words? Just words? ‘We have nothing to fear itself.’ Just words? ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’ Just words? ‘I have a dream’– just words?”  Patrick, who supported Obama’s candidacy, issued a statement that said “Senator Obama and I are longtime friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language.” 44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate – LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate – for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities- Fiction! Again, this is not a direct quote that we can find, but Obama has introduced or cosponsored several bills that have passed in the senate.  The first federal bill passed with Obama as the primary sponsor was the Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act.  He cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, added three amendments to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which passed in the senate but not the house, cosponsored the Obama, McCaskill bill to provide a safety net for families of wounded military personnel, and several other pieces of legislation. 45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq – LIAR, you weren’t in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date – AGAIN. Obama has consistently opposed the war in Iraq and as a presidential candidate has issued proposals on how he would end the war.  In 2007 he did vote in favor of funding for the war saying that he felt that the troops who are there needed it. 46.) I Have Always Supported Universal Health Care – LIAR, your plan leaves us all to pay for the 15,000,000 who don’t have to buy it. This is a confusing statement.  Obama is in favor of universal health care.  He’s not a liar for saying so.  The eRumor criticizes how such care will be paid for, but does not deny that Obama supports it. updated 09/16/08 ","Politics"
"Obama Born out of Wedlock?-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-wedlock/"," The eRumor claims that Barack Obama has been concealing the fact that he was born out of wedlock. "," The text of this forwarded email is from a    news release about Andy Martin, an Illinois man who is releasing a book    titled Obama: The Man Behind The Mask . The news release claims that Senator Obama’s    father, Barack Obama Senior, and his mother, Anne Dunham, never married    and that the senator has been lying about it for decades. Andy Martin variously describes himself as a “Legendary Chicago    muckraker”, “Legendary Chicago Internet columnist”, “ internationally    recognized expert on the Middle East”, “”talk show host”,”America’s most    respected independent foreign policy and intelligence analyst”,”a leading    corruption fighter in Illinois”, and a candidate for the U.S. Senate from    Illinois. Whether Obama was born out of wedlock does not affect his eligibility for    the presidency but it could bring up a credibility issue if his parents    were not married. Obama has    believed them to have been married and has said so on several occasions. There is no good documentation that we know of that they were married or    divorced. Most notable among Obama’s comments about his parents’ marriage are quotes    from his book, Dreams From My Father. Here are excerpts: Speaking of the appearance of his father in his mother’s life, Obama says,    “At the point where my own memories    begin, my mother had already begun a courtship with the man who would    become her second husband.” Again, speaking of his mother and father, “The girl’s parents, wary at    first, were won over by his charm and intellect; the young couple married,    and she bore them a son, to whom he bequeathed his name.” “…self-knowledge, even if accessible, would have made my mother’s    engagement any easier for him to swallow. In fact, how and when the    marriage occurred remains a bit murky, a bill of particulars that I’ve    never quite had the courage to explore. There’s no record of a real    wedding, a cake, a ring, a giving away of the bride. No families were in    attendance; it’s not even clear that people back in Kansas were fully    informed. Just a small civil ceremony, a justice of the peace. The whole    thing seems so fragile… “ Obama’s mother told him that she and her father were married and also    divorced, “It wasn’t your father’s fault that he left, you know. I    divorced him. When the two of us got married, your grandparents weren’t    happy with the idea.

"," The Los Angeles Times reported on May 30, 2008 that the Democratic Campaign released a doctor’s letter that Barack Obama was in “in excellent health”.  The letter, by his longtime physician, stated that although the Senator had not undergone a physical examination for sixteen months that he was physically able to serve as President of the United States.   The report also mentioned that the presidential candidate was struggling to quit smoking tobacco.

"Senator Barack Obama is a Moslem-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama/"," Various stories and questions about Barack Obama. "," Barack Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in February, 2007.  As with other high profile politicians there are stories and questions that began circulating on the Internet about him. There are several emails circulating that, in different ways, say that Obama is Muslim. In December 2009 a new rumor began circulating with a photo of the President saying that he was preparing to pray with Muslims at the Whitehouse in Washington DC during a Muslim prayer event in September 2009.  The photo was taken several months before in April 2009 while the President was removing his shoes to visit a mosque in Turkey. Whitehouse photo: Obama visits mosque in Turkey Obama’s middle name is Hussein (named after his father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr.), his heritage does include Islam, and his grandfather was Muslim.  But there does not seem to be a time when either he or his parents were practicing Muslims and Obama regards himself as a Christian.  Until his resignation from membership in 2008, he was a member of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ where one Sunday morning in 1988 he said walked down the aisle during an alter call by the pastor, Jeremiah Wright. One of the emails says that Obama used the Koran for his swearing-in ceremony in the Senate and intended to use it for his swearing in as president. He did not use a Koran for his swearing in to the Senate and used a Bible when he was inaugurated as president. Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim, did use the Koran for his swearing in ceremony in 2007. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors including ones about his faith. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. Falsini Interview Some of the most definitive information about Obama’s faith comes from an interview he did with journalist Cathleen Falsini.  She writes that Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii to a white mother who came from Protestant Midwestern stock but whom Obama describes in his own book as a Christian but “a lonely witness for secular humanism.”  Obama’s father was a black African from the Luo tribe of Kenya.  Obama called him agnostic.  Obama’s grandfather on his father’s side was Muslim.  When he was six years old, Obama’s mother and father divorced and she married an Indonesian man who was a non-practicing Moslem.  They moved to Indonesia where Obama said he attended a Roman Catholic school until he was 10.  An article Scott Turow on Salon.com in 2004, however, said that while in Indonesia, Obama spent 2 years in a Moslem school then 2 more in the Catholic school. In terms of actual beliefs, Obama told Falsini that he has a deep faith “…rooted in the Christian tradition.”  He added, “I believe that there are many paths to the same place, and that is a belief that there is a higher power, a belief that we are connected as a people, that there are values that transcend race or culture, that move us forward, and that there’s an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively to take responsibility to make those values lived.” He said his mother “…was a deeply spiritual person and would spend a lot of time talking about values and give me books about the world’s religions and talk to me about them.  Her view always was that underlying these religions was a common set of beliefs about how you treat other people and how you aspire to act, not just for yourself but also for the greater good.” He also told Falsini, “Alongside my own deep personal faith, I am a follower, as well, of our civic religion. I am a big believer in the separation of church and state.  I am a big believer in our constitutional structure.” Regarding his conversion experience, Obama said, ”  It wasn’t an epiphany. It was much more of a gradual process for me.  I know there are some people who fall out.  Which is wonderful.  God bless them.  For me, I think it was just a moment to certify or publicly affirm a growing faith in me.”  Critics have said that his Christian faith is a political choice to help his image and conceal Islam in his life.  Supporters point out that his conversion took place before he ran for any public office.  In the Falsini interview he said he reads the Bible, although not as much as he wants to, and that prayer is a part of his daily life but not in the formal sense.  “I think I have an ongoing conversation with God.  Throughout the day I’m constantly asking myself questions about what I’m doing, why I am doing it,” he said.  “The difficult thing about any religion, including Christianity, is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize.  There’s the belief, certainly in some quarters, that if people haven’t embraced Jesus Christ as their personal savior, they’re going to hell,” he told Falsini.  She said Obama did not believe that he or anyone else was going to hell and that he wasn’t sure he was going to heaven either.  “What I believe in is that if I live my life as well as I can, that I will be rewarded.  I don’t presume to have knowledge of what happens after I die.  But I feel very strongly that whether the reward is in the here and now or in the hereafter, aligning myself to my faith and values is a good thing.” Obama’s support of abortion, including the controversial partial-birth abortion procedure, resulted in controversy when he was invited by evangelical pastor Rick Warren to be the keynote speaker at an AIDS conference at Saddleback Church in Southern California in 2006.  Warren, who is opposed to abortion, said his invitation to Obama had nothing to do with abortion and that he wanted to embrace diverse voices in his fight against AIDS.  Abortion opponents argued, however, that someone like Obama whose support of abortion included something so extreme as partial-birth abortion should not be given such a prominent platform and endorsement from pro-lifers. Christianity Today In an interview published in Christianity Today magazine in January, 2008, Obama said regarding his beliefs “I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life. But most importantly, I believe in the example that Jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful.” In the same interview Obama said, “There is one thing that I want to mention that I think is important. Part of what we’ve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e-mails that have been sent out, denying my faith, talking about me being a Muslim, suggesting that I got sworn in the U.S. Senate with a Quran in my hand or that I don’t pledge allegiance to the flag. I think it’s really important for your readers to know that I have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years, and I have never practiced Islam. I am respectful of the religion, but it’s not my own.” Click here for the page on Obama’s site that deals with his faith.

The President did leave out the “under God” because those words did not appear in the copy of the text that was given to him.  This according to a November 20, 2013 article by the Washington Times . The article said that Burns gave President Obama the first version of the famous speech, which did not contain the phrase “under God.” Burns recorded the five living U.S. Presidents along with other elected officials and celebrities who recited Lincoln’s speech.   The videos were posted on the LearnTheAddress.Org website . Below is the text of the Gettysburg Address that was delivered by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863.  If you play the video of President Obama’s reading you will see some differences from the famous speech. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

"Hawaii Was Not a State When Obama was Born There and his Mother Was Not Eligible to Give Birth to a U.S. Citizen-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-birth/"," There are a couple of eRumors about this: One says Obama was born in Hawaii before it became a part of the United States and is, therefore, not a U.S. citizen by birth, which is a requirement for being president. The other says that U.S. law stipulates that if only one parent was a citizen at the time of your birth, that parent must have resided in the United States for at least ten year, at least five of which had to be after the age of 16.  The eRumor says that Obama’s mother was only 18 when he was born, which was only 2 years after the age of 18.  One version claims to be from economist Thomas Sowell. "," All of these claims are intentional hoaxes, including the version that claims to be from Thomas Sowell.  Somebody simply tacked his name onto the eRumor. First, Hawaii became a part of the United States in 1959.  Barack Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961 so his birth was in the United States, not just a U.S. territory.  Obama has posted his birth certificate on his web site. Even if he had been born in Hawaii when it was a U.S. territory, he would still be regarded as a citizen.  According to The Immigration and Nationality Act, Title III, SEC. 305. [8 C. 1405], “A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth.”  Republican candidate John McCain was born in Panama and is considered to be a U.S. citizen under the same act.  McCain was born on a U.S. military base and both of his parents were U.S. citizens. If Obama was born in Hawaii, the issue of the citizenship of his mother is not relevant because he would be a citizen by birth.  But the law cited in the eRumor about having just one parent with U.S. citizenship applied to persons born outside of the United States (or specified U.S. territories).  Between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, the law specified that if you were born outside of the United States and only one of your parents was a citizen, that parent must have resided in the United States for at least 10 years, at least 5 of which were after the age of 16. The qualifications for president are set in Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution: “No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.” After these two eRumors circulated, an Illinois attorney filed a lawsuit claiming that Obama was not born in Hawaii but was born in the African country of Kenya.

He was the keynote speaker at an the “Building a Covenant for A New America” conference sponsored by a group called the Call to Renewal. Click here for the video It was one of Obama’s more religiously-based speeches that talked about the tensions that exist in a country of secular laws but religious passions. He argued that “secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square.” He called for a “reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism” and called on those with narrow religious views to translate those into broader common values that can guide public policy. As an example, he said, “And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson’s, or Al Sharpton’s? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount – a passage that is so radical that it’s doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let’s read our bibles. Folks haven’t been reading their bibles.” This statement caused controversy among Evangelical Christians because it seemed as though Obama was being cynical about what could appear to be confecting statements in scripture. Obama’s supporters say, however, that he was not making fun of those scriptures but merely using them to illustrate the point of his speech, which was to point out the complexity of holding religious values in high regard but trying to reconcile them with public policy.

Once in a while, the tabloid hits one out of the ball park. In 2006-07, the Enquirer broke a story about former U.S. Senator John Edwards’ extramarital affair with Rielle Hunter, which resulted in the termination of his White House run in 2008. If Edwards had lost the primary, speculators said there was a very good chance that he would have been chosen for the vice president position on the 2008 Democratic ticket. Edwards confessed to the adulterous relationship in August 2008, and two years later the couple had a daughter together. Posted 04/10/14 ","Politics"
"Quotes from the writings of Barack Obama-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-books/"," A collection of quotes from two books written by Senator Barack Obama that try to highlight his attitudes about race and Islam.  Later versions of this eRumor have been circulating under the title of Coil of Rage . "," All but two of the quotes seem to be accurate, but are taken out of context. One of the quotes does not exist and the one about Islam is fabricated. Also, whoever constructed this eRumor claims that some of the quotes are from a book by Obama titled Dreams of My Father .  The actual title of Obama’s book is Dreams From my Father. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. ( CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama) Let’s look at them one-at-a-time: “I ceased to advertise my mother’s race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.”- Truth! This is an accurate quote from the introduction to Dreams from My Father. The book chronicles Obama’s experience as the son of an African father and an American mother. “I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother’s race.”- Fiction! This quote does not exist in either of Obama’s books. “There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.”- Truth! This is a quote from Dreams from My Father. It it in a section in which Obama describes a job interview with a man in Chicago.  Race had been a part of their discussion and the full quote is, “There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe.  And white—he’d said himself that was a problem.” It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.”- Truth! This one is also from Dreams from My Father. It is from a section when Obama was a college student and wrestling with his identity including as an African-American.  The quote describes his observation of what was required among his fellow students. “I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn’t speak to my own. It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, Dubois and Mandela.”- Truth! This is from Dreams from my Father .  The more complete quote is, “”Yes, I’d seen weakness in other men— Gramps and his disappointments, Lolo and his compromise. But these men had become object lessons for me, men I might love but never emulate, white men and brown men whose fates didn’t speak to my own. It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.” “ I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.”- Fiction! This is a corruption of a quote from Obama’s book The Audacity of Hope. It is from a section that talks about the concerns of immigrants who are American citizens. Here is the accurate and more complete quote:  “Of course, not all my conversations in immigrant communities follow this easy pattern. In the wake of 9/11, my meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans, for example, have a more urgent quality, for the stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging.  They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.” Updated 5/13/08 ","Politics"
"Obama’s New World Order Speech-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-new-world-order/"," Video of a speech made by President Obama talking about new world order and “how ordinary men and women are too small minded to govern their own affairs.” Obama is also alleged to have said “order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all powerful sovereign.” "," This is real video of a speech made in Belgium by the president on March 26, 2014, but it was edited and its meaning was taken out of context. In the first part of the speech the president says: Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union, representatives of our NATO alliance, distinguished guests, we meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build. Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve the inevitable conflicts between states. In the second section of the speech the president continues: And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men, and women, are created equal. But those ideals have also been tested, here in Europe and around the world. Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign . Often this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others and that individual identity must be defined by us versus them, or that national greatness must flow not by what people stand for, but what they are against.

"Associated Press Story About Obama Citizenship Case Reaching Supreme Court- Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ap-obama-case/"," This is a forwarded clipping   allegedly by the Associated Press that says the court case questioning   the birth and citizenship status  of Barack Obama is headed to the   Supreme Court. Some versions of this eRumor ask if Joe Biden is going to   be our interim President before the end of this year. "," There was no such Associated Press Story and all indications lead us to believe that this was an April Fools Joke in 2009. This hoax that first appeared on April 1, 2009 has had a few modifications over the years and refuses to die. There was a court case on January 24, 2010 in Southern California’s Santa Ana Supreme Court filed by attorney Orly Taitz  but Judge David O. Carter, who presided over the case, dismissed it. In a written statement, Carter said that the court cannot “sweep away the votes of over 68 million Americans with the stroke of a pen, ” and “that the U.S. Constitution does not give the court jurisdiction to decide the matter.” An Occidental College spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that President Obama’s records are still sealed and no such transcripts have been released. When asked if the future President used the Obama or Soetoro name at the college, the spokesperson said that although he had not seen the sealed transcripts he had seen a 1981 photo book that was handed out to students and faculty at the beginning of the college year with student photos, names and hometown information. The 1981 photo book had “Barack Obama” under the student’s photo and indicated a home state as Hawaii. There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. The program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and each year awards approximately 7,500 grants. The grants are for both American students who want to study abroad and foreign students who want to study in the US. To be eligible certain criteria must be met. Below is the original 2009 version of this email as appeared on April First 2009: April 1, 2009 AP- WASHINGTON D.C. – In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama’s qualifications for the presidency, the group “Americans for Freedom of Information” has released copies of President Obama’s college transcripts from Occidental College. Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama’s detractors have been seeking. The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama’s legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administration’s efforts to move the country in a new direction. Britain’s Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, “Obama Eligibility Questioned”, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama’s first official visit to the U.K. In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama’s legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama’s dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrio’s case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama’s citizenship or qualification to serve as president. Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama’s campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.

"Questions about Michelle Obama","2015-03-17 18:06:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama/"," Michelle Obama, the wife of presidential candidate Barack Obama, has popped up in eRumors in 2008 about two issues.  One is that she is alleged to have said during the campaign that for the first time in her adult lifetime she is proud of her country.  There are also questions about why her graduate thesis from Princeton University has been classed as restricted until after November 5th, 2008, which is one day after the general election. "," Did Michelle Obama say “For the first time in my    adult lifetime I am proud of my country?”- Truth! It was during speeches in Milwaukee and    Madison, Wisconsin on February 18, 2008. In Milwaukee she said, “ People    in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of    politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my    country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.” In Madison, she said, ““For    the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country … not    just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry    for change.  I have been desperate to see our country moving in that    direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and    disappointment.” A spokesperson for the Obama Campaign,    Jan Psake, said Michelle Obama was not trying to knock her country but    rather to “underscore the meaning behind her husband’s campaign.”     She added, “ The    point is that of course Michelle is proud of her country, which is why she    and Barack talk constantly about how their story wouldn’t be possible in    any other nation on Earth.  What she meant is that she’s really proud    at this moment because for the first time in a long time, thousands of    Americans who’ve never participated in politics before are coming out in    record numbers to build a grassroots movement for change.” Critics, however, seized upon her    statement and wondered aloud why there would not be any other times in her    adult life when she felt proud of her country. Has Michelle Obama’s Princeton thesis    been restricted for any public release until after November 5?- Previously    Truth! But it has now been    released from restriction! Princeton University released the    thesis to the public on March 25, 2008, after criticism of the fact that    it was being held for release until the day after the general election. The thesis was written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson.     At Princeton, Michelle Obama focused on sociology and earned a certificate    in African-American studies. The title of the thesis was    “Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.” An article in the Daily Princetonian from March 26, 2008, quoted the    thesis as examining “…how the attitudes of black alumni have changed    over the course of their time at the University” and “…whether they will    become more or less motivated to benefit the black community.” She surveyed 89 black graduates of Princeton and concluded from her    research that “attending the University as an undergraduate decreased the    extent to which black alumni identified with the black community as a    whole.” No explanation has been given for why    the thesis was restricted for public access, although that can be    requested by an alumnus.

The background of this story is that George W. Bush’s father was Mr.    Reagan’s Vice President and the quote was designed to appear as though it    was written during Regan’s years in the White House. The truth is that the “Kinsley” referred to in the quote is columnist    Michael Kinsley who got a phone call from a friend in 2007 to tell him    that his name had ended up in “The Reagan Diaries” that had been recently    published. Kinsley looked onto it and found that he was indeed mentioned as one of a    handful of reporters who supposedly had an “off the record” lunch with    President Reagan in March, 1986.  Kinsley puzzled at that because he    doesn’t remember such a luncheon. In July, 2007, Kinsley wrote an article for The New Republic titled    “My Lunch with Reagan” in which he smilingly recounted what could have run    through his mind after he first heard that he appeared in the diaries. Such as: “January 22, 1983. Mommie    says that Kinsley’s column this week in The New Republic undermines the    entire philosophical basis of my administration. O dear O dear, I had    better not read it.”  The reference to “Mommie” was about Nancy    Reagan. And then he added, “May 17, 1986. A moment I’ve been    dreading. George brought his ne’er-do-well son around this morning and    asked me to find the kid a job. Not the political one who lives in    Florida.

Maybe I’ll call Kinsley over at The New Republic and see if they’ll hire    him as a contributing editor or something.

"," This eRumor began circulating more than a year prior to Senator Edward (Teddy)  Kennedy’s death in August, 2009, but it was revived after he died on August 25, 2009 as a result of brain cancer. Serving in the US Senate for the state of Massachusetts from 1962 to 2009, Kennedy championed many controversial and liberal issues from abortion to immigration reform during his political career. According to a May 20, 2008 NPR article, after a seizure the Senator was diagnosed with a malignant t glioma, a form of brain cancer in May of 2008. The article said that treatment for this form of cancer usually involves surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Some of the points of this email appear to have been taken from a page about Senator Kennedy on the Who’s Who website www.nbdb.com. Some other comments might have been added by others who forwarded this email. Click for NBDB site. Let’s look at them one-at-a-time:: 1: Kennedy was caught cheating at Harvard and expelled twice, once for cheating on a test, and once for paying a classmate to cheat for him. Truth! and Fiction! Adam Clymer is a journalist who covered Washington for the New York Times who had been writing about Ted Kennedy since he played football for Harvard in the 1950’s. Clymer wrote a book called, Edward M. Kennedy: a biography based on personal interviews with the senator as well as published reports. According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy was expelled only once from Harvard, not twice, and he never paid a classmate to cheat for him. According to Clymer, it was in 1951 that Kennedy had a fellow student named Bill Frate take his Spanish exam. Kennedy was concerned his C -minus grade could result in his removal from the Harvard football team. Clymer said, there was no monetary compensation for the cheating episode and as a friend, Frate agreed to take the test in Kennedy’s name. Frate was recognized by a graduate student who proctored the exam when the exam was handed in. The two were reported to and shortly afterwards expelled from the university. They were told that they could reapply in one or two years if their conduct improved. Ted returned to Harvard after 1953 where he worked harder in his studies and earned an A minus in Spanish and eventually graduated with a Bachelors degree in 1956. 2. Kennedy enlisted in the Army for four years.  His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England, intervened to have his enlistment shortened to two years. Truth! According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy spent three or four weeks figuring out what he was going to do after his expulsion from Harvard and on June 25, 1951 enlisted in the U.S. Army.   The Korean War was already a year old and the young Kennedy, unaware of the student deferment policy signed induction papers for a four year term.   Having already lost a son in World War II, His father, Joseph Kennedy, was able to intervene in Teddy’s behalf and reduced his hitch in the Army by two years. 3. While in the Army, Kennedy was assigned to Paris but never advanced beyond the rank of Private. Truth! Clymer said that, after basic training at Fort Dix, in New Jersey Private Kennedy was assigned to Camp Gordon in Georgia for three months for military police training. There were a couple of incidents that resulted in a lot of latrine duty for Kennedy. Among them was a incident when on a cold night he tried to keep warm using a can of Sterno, a fuel made from jellied and denatured alcohol. It caused a fire when his sleeping bag ignited. Once again, at the intervention of Joe Kennedy, the Private was assigned as part of the honor guard for the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Paris, France. Kennedy received an honorable discharge from the US Army in 1953 at the rank of Private. 4. While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving four times. Unproven! Kennedy did attend the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville. His biographer said that Kennedy “drove wildly and got several speeding tickets.” The book also said that he once out ran a police car. 5. In 1964, Kennedy was legally intoxicated when his plane crashed.  He hospitalized for several months. The results of the blood alcohol test remained a “state secret” until in the 1980’s. Fiction! This makes it sound as though Kennedy was the pilot and that he was flying drunk. He was a passenger, however, and alcohol had nothing to do with either Kennedy or the accident. The plane crash happened on June 10, 1964. Kennedy, his wife Joan, Indiana Senator Birch Baye, Senator Baye’s wife, and Kennedy’s administrative assistant, Ed Moss, were being flown Washington D.C. to West Springfield, Massachusetts, the location of the Democratic Party Convention. The plane struck the ground during an instrument approach and a later investigation blamed the crash on pilot error. Kennedy was seriously injured in the crash, spent months in rehabilitation, and was plagued with back pain for the rest of his life. The eRumor said that Kennedy had been illegally impaired by alcohol during this crash but Ted Kennedy but he was not the pilot of this plane.   His Blood alcohol level would have no meaning in any investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), CAB or or National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) . 6. On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts and later  drove Mary Jo Kopechne home.  The car ran off the bridge, flipped, and into Poucha Pond and Kopechne drowned.   It is widely assumed Kennedy was drunk.   Kennedy was given a suspended sentence of two months. Truth! and Unproven! This is one of the most famous incidents in Kennedy’s life. It is true that a car that he was driving went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island on July 19, 1969 and that a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne died in the accident. According to Clymer’s book, it was a hot July day on the island and Kennedy had competed in the annual Edgartown Regatta, a sailboat race, earlier and finished in ninth place out of 31 boats. After the race, Kennedy returned to his hotel room, soaked his back in a hot bath and drank a rum and coke. He later went to a reunion of Robert Kennedy campaign workers which was also attended by Mary Jo Kopechne who worked for Robert Kennedy as a legislative aide. It is thought that Kopechne might have been feeling ill from exposure to the sun from the day’s events and Kennedy left the party with her after 11:00 PM to take her back to the inn where she was staying. The fatal accident took place a mile and a half from the cottage where the party was still taking place. The Oldsmobile that Kennedy had been driving went off the bridge on the right side, overturned and landed in the pond where it quickly submerged under the water. Kennedy managed to escape the sinking vehicle but Kopechne didn’t According to published reports, Kennedy stumbled back to the cottage and two other people from the party then went to the scene of the accident and tried to rescue Kopechne, but without success. One of the lingering controversies of the incident is that no one reported it to authorities. Police learned of it from two fishermen the next morning who happened upon the scene. The following day, when the police arrived on the scene and began their investigation Kennedy told them that he was not sure how he had escaped the submerged car and that he dove down to to the point of exhaustion see if his passenger was still in the car. Clymer wrote that the crash left Kennedy with a moderate brain concussion which resulted in memory failure and confusion. Kennedy was charged with leaving the scene of an accident to which he pleaded guilty. Kennedy testified in the inquest that he had only drank two drinks at the party. He was sentenced to 2 months jail time which was suspended. 8. Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years, but his accomplishments seem scant- Fiction! According to the http://www.govtrack.us web site , a civil project that tracks congressional and senate activities, Senator Kennedy Edward Kennedy sponsored 380 bills from Jan 14, 1991. and Aug 6, 2009.     At the time of this investigation 273 of these bills are still in committee and 24 have been successfully enacted. Kennedy also co-sponsored 2047 bills during this period. Kennedy was widely regarded as one of the most powerful senators of his time and below are some of his recently sponsored bills: S. 982: Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act Reported by Committee May 20, 2009 S. 277: Serve America Act Reported by Committee Mar 18, 2009 S. 1405: Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site Designation Act Introduced Jul 7, 2009 S. 1152: Healthy Families Act Introduced May 21, 2009 S. 1410: Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act of 2009 Introduced Jul 8, 2009 S.Res. 36: An original resolution authorizing expenditures by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.

Kennedy was prime instigator and author of every expansion of an increase in immigration, up to and including the latest attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Not to mention the pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court nominees- TRUTH! According to a August 27, 2009 CBS News article , immigration reform was a lifelong cause for Senator Kennedy and he “dramatically changed the United States’ immigration system with the Immigration Act of 1965, which eliminated the quota system and allowed immigration from Latin America and Asia to dramatically increase.”   The article said, “He also worked to pass the Refugee Act of 1980, and in 1986 he supported a measure that allowed nearly three million undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and established penalties against employers who hired illegal immigrants. He supported the Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the number of immigrants that could enter the country, including those who could enter with permanent job-related visas and temporary worker visas.” In 2007 Senators Kennedy cosponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 which failed passage. Because of timing of the original eRumor, it is believed that the two Supreme Court nominees mentioned were Chief Justice John G. Roberts (2005)  and Samuel A. Alito (2006).  Both justices were appointed by President George W. Bush, choices which Kennedy did not approve. The issue of abortion was the key focus in the confirmation hearing of Judge Alito.   In his closing comments during the hearing, Senator Kennedy said, “He didn’t back away one inch from his view that a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions is NOT protected under the Constitution.  He didn’t back away from his criticism of the principle of ‘one person, one vote.'” Kennedy added, “And on the cases he decided, in case after case, we see legal contortions and inconsistent reasoning to bend over backwards to help the powerful. He may cite instances in thish he thinks he helped the little guy. But the record is clear that the average person had a hard time getting a fair shake in Judge Alito’s courtroom.” After the death of William Rehnquist on September 23, 2005,  President George W. Bush nominated John G. Roberts to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. During Robert’s confirmation hearings for Chief Justice, Senator Kennedy said, ” I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States. Sadly, there is ample evidence in John Roberts’ record to indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country’s great march of progress toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has refused to release documents and information from his years in the Reagan Administration and in the first Bush Administration that might indicate otherwise, but without those records, we have no way of knowing.” Kennedy added, “John Roberts’s nomination are trying to force a nominee to adopt our “partisan” positions, to support our “causes,” to yield to our “special interest” agendas.” Kennedy also said, “Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most important functions. The future and the quality of life in this nation may literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a rubber stamp for the President’s nominees, if we put party over principle, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more important if we go along to get along with the White House we will be undermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish the great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and reasonable “no” vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent consciences tell us to do so.” Roberts attended Harvard Law School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review and after passing his bar exam, served as a law clerk for William Rehnquist.   Roberts was confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and later swore into office of the President of the United States another former editor of the Harvard Law Review, Barack Hussein Obama. 10. He is known around Washington as a public drunk, loud, boisterous and very disrespectful to ladies- Mostly True! Kennedy had a well-known problem with alcohol and in his earlier years was described by some as a “womanizer” and a “drunk.” Biographer Edward Klein said Kennedy was “…like the playboy of the Western world.” Klein said that Kennedy could get attention in his family by being the clown. CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller described Kennedy as a prolific elder statesman on one side and a brazen bad boy on the other.” She also said that after Kennedy’s first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in 1980, his reputation with women and booze spun out of control. Klein described a drunken incident in Alaska in 1969. He said Kennedy began yelling “Es-ki-mo Power!” and saying things like “They’re going to shoot my ass off the way they shot Bobby…” After the trip John Lindsey of Newsweek called Kennedy family friend Lester Hyman and told him about the Alaska incident. He said “Your friend Ted Kennedy is in a lot of trouble psychologically.” He was known for his boisterousness and loudness. He was famous for spontaneously bursting forth into song—and at a high volume. In 1991, Time magazine called him a “Palm Beach Boozer” and GQ magazine described him as “an aging Irish boy clutching a bottle.” Most credit his second marriage to Victoria Reggie Kennedy in 1992 as marking a change for the better in his life. updated 09/01/09 ","Politics"

"Military Service of Jeremiah Wright-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jeremiah-wright/"," The eRumor describes an African-American man who volunteered for the Marines in 1961 then after completing his service volunteered to be a Navy corpsman, a career that won him recognition for his service including being a part of the medical team at Bethesda Naval Hospital that tended to President Lyndon B.

"Discussion of Canadian Health Care-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarys-health-care-plan/"," Prompted by Senator Hillary Clinton’s health care proposals, the writer of the eRumor says all is not well in Canada where a universal health care plan has been in effect for a long time. "," This is a complex story and some of it, such as whether Senator Hillary Clinton’s health    care proposals have merit, is a matter of political, social, and economic    opinion. We don’t have a name for the writer of this eRumor or whether it was    really written from Canada or not, but we can look into some of the    specific topics it raises. First, health care polices and prices in    Canada may differ    from province to province.  The national government sends health care    dollars to the provinces but the provincial and territorial governments each establish    their own guidelines. Some of the topics in the eRumor are personal and about people in the    writer’s family and we can’t document those.  Other topics are    commentary, but here are some of the issues raised: Canadian health care is not free and is    funded mostly by taxes- Truth! Most Canadians pay an annual health care    premium that averages several hundred dollars per month.  Low income    families and those on assistance are exempted.  But the bulk of    health care costs is paid for by taxes.  Whether the writer is really    in a 55% tax bracket or not is not known.  The Canadian Federal    Finance Department estimates, however, that Canadians pay an average of    35% to 40% in income taxes. There are long waiting lists for treatment in Canada- Truth! Even the most enthusiastic of Canadians    admit that the health care system can be sluggish when it comes to getting    treatment.  It’s technically illegal for doctors and hospitals to    provide private care for anything that is covered by the government health    care system, but there is a growing industry of private hospitals where    people can pay for services that they would otherwise have to wait a long    time to get. Many Canadians do not have a family doctor- Truth! Most Canadians do have a family doctor    but if you don’t have one, finding one may be difficult.  There is a    shortage of physicians in Canada and you must find a family doctor who is    accepting new patients.  In 2004 the Canadian Medical Association    estimated that about 14% of Canadians did not have a family physician. You could wait many hours in an    emergency room for treatment- Truth! Almost anybody anywhere in the    world has stories of long waits in emergency rooms–mostly because unless    your problem is life-threatening you’ll not get the attention of those who    are facing more serious problems.  But is is true that in Canada the    lines at emergency rooms are legendarily long. Immigrants get health care coverage in    Canada- Truth! According to the Canadian    Government, immigrants are eligible for health care coverage under the    Canada Health Act, although in some provinces there may be a 90-day    waiting period. Drug addicts get free needles but diabetics must pay for needles in    Canada- Truth! & Fiction! The Canadian government began    needle exchange programs in several areas of Canada in the 1980’s.     The goal was to fight the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C by reducing the    number of contaminated needles being used.  Medical supplies for    diabetics, however, including needles are covered by the health plan.

"," According to the Howard Stern web site, this program aired on October 1, 2008.   Howard Stern is a controversial shock jock with a history of airing racial, sexual and scatological humor.  He has a daily radio program heard on the Sirius Satellite Network. The Stern website posted this description for October first show: “Howard started off the show playing a few clips of Sal asking black people if they were voting for Obama, and attributed all of McCain’s political policies to Obama to see if they would still vote for him. All the interviewees readily agreed with Obama when Sal lied to them about his pro-life, anti-stem-cell research and pro-war policies. Howard said the clips were revealing, and Sal came in to say he thought the election had become less about ideas and, instead, some kind of race war.” Of the three people questioned, two said they are voting for Obama because he is Pro-Life, two said they are voting for Obama because he wants to stay in Iraq and finish the war and one because Obama is against stem cell research.   All said that they had no problem with Sarah Palin being vice president. Owing to the comedic nature of his radio program it is hard to take seriously anything Howard Stern airs on his show.  From a technical viewpoint, the audio consists of three people being interviewed in Harlem but there is no evidence to tell what has been edited out or how many people caught the radio trickster in the act.   Th e question is whether these were edited and were the only audio clips among many that fit what Stern wanted to portray. The audio is posted in various blogs and YouTube sites. CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama updated 10/21/08 ","Politics"

"," The comparisons are fairly accurate, according to published reports. An investigation by the Tennessee Center For Policy Research published in February, 2006, focused on Al Gore’s 10,000 square foot house in Belle Meade area of Nashville.  The former senator and former presidential candidate has been a leading voice for the environment and energy conservation.  His global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth won an Oscar for Best Documentary for 2006.  In the film he urges consumers to conserve energy by reducing the amount of electricity used at home. Using figures from the Nashville Electric service, the report says that Gore’s house used 221,000 221,000 kWh of electricity in 2006, more than 20 times the national average of 10,656 kWh.  The report says the gas usage of Gore’s home is high as well and that Gore spent more than $30,000 in combined electricity and natural gas bills in 2006. An article in Cowboys And Indians magazine focused on the 4,000 square foot Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas.  It paints an entirely different picture than that of the Gore mansion..  George Bush is described as saying that when he bought the property, he wanted something in middle America so he could “stay in touch with real Americans.”  Architect David Heyman was asked to design the single story home.  Bush said he wanted everything on the ranch to blend with the environment. The passive-solar house is built of honey-colored native limestone and positioned to absorb winter sunlight, warming the interior walkways and walls of the 4,000-square-foot residence. Geothermal heat pumps circulate water through pipes buried 300 feet deep in the ground. These waters pass through a heat exchange system that keeps the home warm in winter and cool in summer ,” according to the article.  “ A 25,000-gallon underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof urns; wastewater from sinks, toilets, and showers cascades into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the cistern is then used to irrigate the landscaping around the four-bedroom home.

"Obama Plans to Name Holder the Supreme Court – Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/eric-holder-justice/"," Attorney General Eric Holder resigned from his post so President Obama could appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court while Democrats controlled the Senate. "," There’s no proof that President Obama plans to appoint Eric Holder to the U.S. Supreme Court, or that any sitting justice plans to step down. The eRumor also makes false claims that a Senate rule change would render Republicans powerless to stop a hypothetical confirmation hearing for Holder before the end of 2014. One of the first appearances of the eRumor came in August 2014 on MSNBC. Georgetown Law Professor Eric Dyson hypothesized that Obama or Holder would be “great choices” for Supreme Court appointments a month before Holder announced his resignation. But Dyson went on to say that either possibility was unlikely. Holder’s resignation in September 2014 wasn’t a surprise, the New York Times reports . The attorney general had long said he planned to leave office by the end of 2014. But following Holder’s resignation, Rush Limbaugh hypothesized that Holder could be appointed to the high court, which fueled speculation about the timing of Holder’s resignation. Although Dyson and Limbaugh both hypothesized about the possibility of Holder’s appointment to the Supreme Court, neither political commentator cited hard evidence that an actual appointment was eminent. The eRumor’s claim that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg plans to step down also rings hollow. The 81-year-old justice told Elle Magazine in September 2014 that speculation about her resignation was “misguided.” “If I resign at any time this year, (Obama) could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court,” Ginsberg said. “Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they’re misguided.” Ginsberg’s comments reflect the Senate confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees. Although Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) successfully changed Senate filibuster rules to make presidential appointments easier — the rule change does not apply to Supreme Court nominees, the Washington Post reports . That means Republicans would be able to filibuster a theoretical last-minute confirmation hearing. Posted 10/07/14 ","Politics"

Rampant reports have also alleged that FEMA is quietly setting up Ebola quarantine camps across the U.S. "," The Ebola pandemic in West Africa has quickly grown into a global crisis , but an Ebola zombie apocalypse is not imminent. Internet users in China coined the term “zombie disease” in August 2014, and rumors spread about the virus’ ability to reanimate its victims as flesh-eating zombies. But China’s state-run Zinhua News Agency quickly dispelled rumors of the so-called “zombie disease” sweeping West Africa. “The term — which Baike, a Chinese online encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia, even lists as a synonym for Ebola — appears to arise from the virus’ high fatality rate and the particularly gruesome death it can cause, sometimes with bleeding from the eyes, ears and gums,” according to a version of the story translated by Foreign Policy . Foreign Policy went on to explain that some people in China believed that once people die from Ebola, they can “unexpectedly reawaken, entering into an extremely violent condition in which they bite any moving object, including humans and animals.” The Zinhua News Agency cited an unnamed “expert” who claimed Ebola victims actually grow weaker because they lose so much blood and that zombie reanimation “can only happen in the movies.” But that wasn’t the end of the Ebola zombie eRumor. It came back to life on September 24, 2014, after the New Dawn, an independent newspaper that covers Africa, reported that two women had been “resurrected” after apparently succumbing to the virus in Nimba County. But the article makes no mention of “Ebola zombies,” and it’s apparent that the women likely recovered after they had been presumed dead by villagers. News of the resurrections had “created panic in residents of Hope Village Community and Ganta” who described one of the women as a “ghost who shouldn’t live among them,” the New Dawn reported. But the villagers’ panic can easily be attributed to cultural differences and the extremely contagious nature of Ebola. Nevertheless, reports of the so-called zombie apocalypse were spread by American websites and bloggers. Some of those reports included claims that FEMA was preparing for a zombie apocalypse and/or was setting up Ebola quarantine camps. But accompanying photos that allegedly show FEMA workers “quietly establishing Ebola quarantine centers” across the U.S. are a hoax. The photos were taken in Africa in 2012 and were published by Business Insider . Posted 10/02/14 ","Politics"

Some of the eRumor’s claims are based on   legislative developments from 2011 that didn’t come to fruition. The   eRumor repeats an article from the   Gatestone Institute International Policy Council from June 2011. The   original article accurately reported on pending legislation, but the   eRumor omitted information and changed dates to make it appear more   current. In one instance, the eRumor claims a law   prohibiting face-covering Islamic burqas went into effect on Jan. 1,   2014. The original story cited a prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2013.

"," In late September and early October of 2008, after a financial crisis in the home lending industry the United States Senate met and passed HR 1424, the 2008 Economic Stabilization Bill to bail out the industry at a cost of $700,000,000,000.   When news of the bill was released it was found to have several controversial earmarks. Earmarks include an economic development credit for American Samoa, tax exemptions for makers of wooden bows and arrows for children, funding for wool research, and amendments to the Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to the tax deduction for domestic film and television productions.  These were written into the bill before it was presented to the house in March of 2008. On October 3, 2008 the San Francisco Chronicle reported.  “While crafting a bill intended to rescue the U.S. economy this week, lawmakers couldn’t stop themselves from adding billions of dollars in tax breaks that have little to do with restoring confidence in financial markets.” An eRumor questioning the relationship between the American Samoa earmark and Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, gained momentum the week of October 20, 2008 over past criticism of a minimum wage hike in 2007 that omitted American Samoa.

The eRumor re-gained momentum after Hillary Clinton said they were “dead broke” when they left the White House and claimed they were still not “truly well off” in an interview with ABC News in June 2014. The New York Post first reported that the Clintons were jockeying to purchase the 20-acre “Clover Hill Farm” property in July 2010. Located in the affluent town of Bedford Hills, New York, Clover Hill Farm boasts a 7,000-square-foot rustic mansion, two guest homes, horse stables and a heated pool. The New York post reported that the Clintons had visited the property numerous times and planned to ink a deal to purchase the property “within weeks” — but that never happened. The home was first listed in December 2008 for $13.9 million. The asking price dropped to $7.8 million by the time an asset management company purchased it in March 2011. The property was then sold to a Morgan Stanley trader in October 2011 for $5.5 million. As of November 2014, the property hadn’t changed hands again, according to Westchester County tax records .

"Hillary Clinton Six Quotes on Socialism-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clinton-six-quotes/"," This is a forwarded email containing six trivia questions alleging that Hillary Clinton is a socialist with Marxis’ leanings. "," The words came out of the mouth of Hillary Clinton but they were taken out of context. Let us examine these one at a time. 1) “We’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.” According to an Associated Press June 29, 2004 article found in San Diego’s Union Tribune Hillary Clinton was in San Francisco campaigning for Barbara Boxer and Democratic Party candidates when she told supporters to anticipate the loss of the tax cuts that were passed by the Bush Administration if Democrats in the Presidential election and gain full control of the Legislature.  Clinton said, “Many of you are well enough off that … the tax cuts may have helped you.  We’re saying that for America to get back on track, we’re probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.” 2) “It’s time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few…… And to replace it with shared responsibility, for shared prosperity.” According to a May 29, 2007 article by the Boston Globe, while at the Manchester School of Technology, Clinton delivered a policy speech unveiling a nine-point “progressive vision to aid the middle class, address rising income inequality.”  Trying to pre sent a vision contrary to that of the Bush Administration, she said, “They call it the ownership society, but it’s really the ‘on your own’ society,” Clinton said. “It’s time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few, time to reject the idea of an ‘on your own’ society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. I prefer a ‘we’re all in it together’ society.” 3)”(We)…..can’t just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people.” and 4)”We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own … in order to create this common ground.” On June 4, 2007 Clinton appeared with other Democratic presidential hopefuls Barack Obama, and John Edwards on the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer on CNN.   The quotes were taken from a response to a question from Monsignor Kevin Sullivan of Catholic Charities USA.   The monsignor asked,”You have spoken a lot about our need to work for the common good. In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption?” Below is an extract as it appeared in the official CNN transcript. We have put the questionable quotes in italics : CLINTON: I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So, what do we do? We have to build a political consensus. And that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf, in order to create this common ground. The same with energy — you know, we can’t keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil, and the need to deal with global warming, and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God’s creation, and just let business as usual go on . O’BRIEN: Senator… CLINTON: And that means something has … (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: … to be taken away from some people . 5) “I certainly think the free-market has failed.” This appeared later in the same CNN transcript after Dr. Joel C. Hunter, senior pastor of Northland, a Church Distributed of Longwood, Florida asked,”Abortion continues to be one of the most hurtful and divisive facts of our nation. I come from the part of the faith community that is very strongly pro-life. I know you’re pro-choice, but you have indicated that you would like to reduce the number of abortions. Could you see yourself, with millions of voters in a pro-life camp, creating a common ground, with the goal ultimately in mind of reducing the decisions for abortion to zero?” CLINTON: Yes. Yes. And that is what I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare. And it’s been a challenge, because the pro-life and the pro- choice communities have not really been willing to find much common ground. And I think that is a great failing on all of our parts, because, for me… (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: … there are many opportunities to assist young people to make responsible decisions. There is a tremendous educational and public outreach that could be done through churches, through schools, through so much else. But I think it has to be done with an understanding of reaching people where they are today. We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed . We have all failed. We have left too many children to sort of fend for themselves morally. And, so, I think there is a great opportunity. But it would require sort of a — a leaving at the sides the suspicion and the baggage that comes with people who have very strong, heartfelt feelings. You know, when I first started thinking about this very difficult issue — because it is. It’s a moral issue. And it should not be in any way diminished as a moral issue, no matter which side you’re on, because I have seen cases where I honestly believed that the — the moral choice was very complicated and not so straightforward as to what a young woman, her family, her physician, her pastor should do. And what concerns me is that there’s been a — a real reluctance for anyone to make a move toward the other side, for fear of being labeled as turning one’s back on the moral dimensions of the issue from either direction. So, I would invite you, and I would be willing to work with you, to see whether there couldn’t be some common ground that one could find. 6) “I think it’s time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched.” According to a September 3, 2005 article by the Washington Post Clinton accused the oil companies of making a profit from the Katrina disaster by skyrocketing prices.   The article said that Clinton had made clear her concerns over the “anxiety and anger felt by motorists was evident at nearly every turn in her travels throughout the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York.” Clinton said, “ I think it’s time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they’re being watched. I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that’s what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage.” Posted 1/24/14 ","Politics"

"," This is a political opinion that was written on June 28, 2012 and posted on the conservative commentary web site, I.M. Citizen. Click for article. Nine Supreme Court Justices heard arguments in the form of four questions inquiring if the Affordable Healthcare law is Constitutional.  We found an article that explained it “In Plain English,”  in a June 28, 2012 article found on the Supreme Court of the United States Blog . The article said that the primary question was if it was legal for Congress to require that Americans purchase health insurance by 2014 or be penalized. It said that “the government’s primary argument was that Congress can require everyone to buy health insurance using its power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, because the failure to buy insurance shifts the costs of health care for the uninsured to health care providers, insurance companies, and everyone who does have health insurance.”  The article went on to say that five Justices,  Chief Justice Roberts along with Justices Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, “all rejected that argument. But the government still won, because a different set of five Justices – the Chief Justice, and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan – agreed that the mandate was constitutional, but for a different reason.”   That being the power of Congress “to regulate commerce assumes that there is commercial activity to regulate and in the view of Chief Justice Roberts “the mandate creates activity, rather than regulating it.” The article continued to say that Chief Justice Roberts did reject the government’s Commerce Clause argument but “agreed with one of the government’s alternative arguments: the mandate imposes a tax on people who do not buy health insurance, and that tax is something that Congress can impose using its constitutional taxing power. He acknowledged that the mandate (and its accompanying penalty) is primarily intended to get people to buy insurance, rather than to raise money, but it is, he explained, still a tax. If someone who does not want to buy health insurance is willing to pay the tax, that’s the end of the matter; the government cannot do anything else.” Denying the Court’s claim of a tax, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters in a briefing the following day that the fine is still just a penalty.   In a July 2, 2012 Fox News article GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s campaign was quick to toss a challenge to President Obama to make a decision to either call this “an unconstitutional penalty or a ‘constitutional tax,’ but not both.” While promoting the Affordable Healthcare Law, President Obama said that the individual mandate is not a tax. https://youtube.com/watch?v=bg-ofjXrXio Video of Obama Interview on ABC found on YouTube The genius status of Justice John Roberts might be settled by the results of the November 2012 Presidential election. update 7/3/12 ","Politics"

This eRumor may have been sparked in 2009 by a project with the U.S.D.A.

The Alliance Defense Fund, which defends religious liberties, said that   initial instructions for the students specified that the ornaments   needed to be 9-12 inches tall, able to endure cold winter weather,   include a loop of wire for hanging, be able to be seen at least 75 feet   away, and could “not reflect religious or political themes.” An outcry of protest resulted and the Forest Service rescinded the   prohibition of religious themes saying that it was a mistake that it was   ever communicated that way A spokesperson for the Alliance Defense Fund told TruthorFiction.com   that it program organizers that “The First Amendment does not allow   government officials to exclude schoolchildren’s ornaments for the   capitol’s Christmas tree merely because they communicate a religious   viewpoint.” Jim Payne, a U.S.D.A.

"Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad is Why Keystone Was Not Approved-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/burlington-rail-road/"," Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF), owned by President Obama-backer Warren Buffett, would lose billions of dollars in oil freight if the Keystone XL Pipeline were approved. "," This hoax has been circling the Internet in an email that went viral. The claim that BNSF owns all the railroad lines that connect the United States to western Canada is false. Canadian Pacific Railway operates some 14,000 miles of rail that extend from provinces in western Canada down through the Midwest. BNSF, meanwhile, operates 32,500 miles of track in 28 states and two Canadian provinces, the company said on its website. The eRumor’s claim that BNSF transports 80 percent of the oil imported from Canada is mathematically impossible. Berkshire Hathaway, BNSF’s parent company, said in its 2013 annual report that BNSF transports about 500,000 barrels of oil per day. That accounts for about 10 percent of oil produced in the lower 48 states. The United States imports up to 2.2 million barrels of oil from Canada per day, according to an NPR report in April 2012. BNSF would have to transport 1.76 million barrels of oil per day to account for 80 percent Canadian imports, which is far beyond the company’s capacity. The eRumor’s claims about the cost of transporting oil by rail vs. pipeline also appear to be incorrect. According to an April 2014 New York Times report , it costs about $5 per barrel to transport oil via pipeline, and $10 to $15 to transport oil via rail. The claim that President Obama refuses to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline because Buffett stands to lose billions of dollars in oil freight is also false. Experts have said that a combination of rail and pipeline is needed to handle the volume of oil being transported in the United States. Neither system will have the capacity to transport all the oil. Buffet weighed in on the issue in an interview with the Minneapolis Star Tribune in Mach 2014. “I think the Keystone pipeline is probably a good idea for the country,” Buffett said. Buffet added that he wasn’t sure if it would be cheaper to transport millions of barrels of oil by pipeline or rail over the course of 100 years. The eRumor was correct on one point, however. Buffet has been a longtime supporter of Obama. Buffett has a well-documented history of making campaign contributions and hosting fundraisers, as ABC News reported in 2011 .

"President Obama Criticized by an Editor of London Daily Telegraph- Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alex-singleton-obama/"," A scathing article about President Obama allegedly written by Alex Singleton of the United Kingdom’s London Daily Telegraph.  It says that President Obama has animosity towards Great Britain because of how it once ruled Kenya.  Because of this the President returned a bust of Winston Churchill that England gave to the U.S. and also gave cheesy gifts to Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Gordon Brown. "," Alex Singleton is an editor at the London Daily Telegraph but he did not write the entire article and only a small portion came from him. In a June 30, 2010 London Telegraph article Singleton wrote that he has “become a poster boy for the Republican Right” and has a new following of conservative Americans thanks to what he called a “nutty hoax email.” Singleton did write a blog for the Telegraph on March 11, 2010 suggesting “not terribly seriously, that Brits ought to boycott America in retaliation against Barack Obama’s refusal to support us in the Falklands.” The only part of this email that came from Singleton said, “ Let me be clear: I’m not normally in favour   of boycotts, and I love the American people. I holiday in their country regularly, and hate the tedious snobby sneers against the United States. But the American people chose to elect an idiot who seems hell bent on insulting their allies, and something must be done to stop Obama’s reckless foreign policy, before he does the dirty on his allies on every issue.” Everything else that followed in the forwarded email was added by some unknown prankster who converted the message into a rant against the President Obama. In his disclaimer, Singleton added, “My new fans won’t like me saying this, but while Barack Obama is clearly one of the most hopeless Western leaders at the moment, I haven’t forgiven the Republicans for their disgraceful record under George W. Bush.” Updated 4/14/11 ","Politics"
"Chairman of Progressive Insurance Peter Lewis Donated Millions to Left Wing Organizations-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aclu-lewis/"," Progressive Insurance Chairman Peter Lewis donates millions of dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org and other “leftist” causes.

He held the post until he died in 2013 at the age of 80. Lewis also served as the CEO of Progressive Insurance for 35 years before he stepped down in 2000. At the time of this death, Forbes estimates that Peter Lewis’s net worth was $1.3 billion. During his life, Lewis used his wealth to support progressive causes, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Moveon.org , as the eRumor claims. In 2003, the ACLU announced that Peter Lewis had donated $8 million to the group to “fight Bush Administration policies that trample on civil liberties.” The donation was split between the ACLU’s general fund ($2 million) and its endowment, the Trust for the Bill of Rights ($6 million). Lewis also donated $7 million to the ACLU’s general fund in 2001, so the claim that Lewis donated $15 million to ACLU from 2001 to 2003 is true. The claim that Peter Lewis and George Soros supported Moven.org is also true. The group was first launched to help persuade Congress to drop impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Later, it shifted its attention to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, in 2003, Peter Lewis and George Soros dedicated up to $5 million to help the group’s efforts to defeat President Bush, the Los Angeles Times reports . Peter Lewis was also a supporter of efforts to legalize marijuana for medical use. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimated in 2012 that Lewis had spent between $40 and $60 million funding the cause since the 1980s. Last updated 1/22/15 ","Politics"

"Abraham Lincoln Ordered the Execution of 39 Men-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:02:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abraham-lincoln-ordered-the-execution-of-39-men/"," Abraham Lincoln ordered the mass execution of 39 men in 1862 for treaty violations like hunting on land outside of their reservation. "," This eRumor is based on real events, but it gets most of the details wrong. A Facebook post that appeared on social media includes a photo of dozens of men hanging from a gallow with a caption that begins: “This picture is of 39 men that were ordered to be executed by Abraham Lincoln for treaty violations (hunting off of their assigned reservation). Yes the ‘Great Emancipator’ as the history books so fondly referred to him as.” It’s true that 38 (not 39) Dakota men were executed on December 26, 1862, in America’s largest mass execution ever. But the eRumor’s first false claim is that the men were executed for things like “hunting off of their assigned reservation.” The truth is that the Dakota men were hanged after a bloody conflict with white settlers. The Dakota were frustrated with late annuity payments for land, with corrupt traders and government officials, and with not having a way for their complaints to be heard, according to records kept by the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Then, in August of 1862, it boiled over when four young Dakota men killed five white people, including a 14-year-old girl. The Dakota men got into an argument about stealing chicken eggs from a white farmer, and the killings were to prove to each other that they weren’t afraid of white men, Big Eagle, a member of the Dakota at the time, later recalled . That led to a bloody conflict between the Dakota and the white settlers of Minnesota over the next couple months. There were as many as 600 white people killed and hundreds more Dakota. More than a thousand Dakota were taken prisoner and Colonel Henry Sibley — who had been appointed by Minnesota’s governor to handle the conflict — set up a military commission to try the prisoners for “murders and outrages” committed against Americans, according to historical accounts of the trials: “The trials were elaborately conducted until the commission became acquainted with the details of the different outrages and battles, and then, the only point being the connection of the prisoner with them, five minutes would dispose of a case. “If witnesses testified, or the prisoner admitted, that he was a participant, sufficient was established. As many as 40 were sometimes tried in a day. Those convicted of plundering were condemned to imprisonment; those engaged in individual massacres and in battles, to death.” The commission had sentenced 307 Dakota to death by the end of the trials. A list of Dakota men who were to be executed was sent to Abraham Lincoln for approval. And, this is the second time that the eRumor jumps the rails. Lincoln’s action to pardon most of the men infuriated Minnesotans and has been viewed by many as an example of Lincoln’s “Solomon-like wisdom,” according to the Johns Hopkins University Press : “Lincoln willfully ordered this mass hanging in order to appease a Minnesota settler populace threatening riots and anarchy, perhaps even secession, if he did not do as they demanded. “During the war trials that followed the 1862 conflict, President Lincoln was made aware of the conditions on the Dakota reservations, particularly at Lower Sioux, in addition to Minnesotans’ clarion call for the Dakotas’ extermination. With this in mind, the process through which Lincoln decided to reduce the number of condemned from three hundred and three to thirty-nine (with the thirty-ninth acquitted at the last moment) is seen by some as another example of this president’s Solomon-like wisdom. In other words, Lincoln is credited with having drawn a difficult compromise between a vengeful populace and a defeated Indian nation reduced to being prisoners of war. Even Dakota writer and activist Charles Alexander Eastman, whose father and uncles fought against the United States in 1862, expressed his gratitude for Lincoln’s magnanimity, when he stated in his 1915 book ‘The Indian To-Day’ that a ‘new Indian policy’ emerged when Lincoln refused ‘to order the execution of three hundred Sioux braves, whom a military court had, in less than two days, convicted of murder and condemned to be hung, in order to satisfy the clamor of the citizens of Minnesota.’” It’s true that actions taken by Congress forced the Dakota from Minnesota after the executions were carried out on December 26, 1862 — but it’s not fair to place all the blame for that on Lincoln, the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council reports : “The original Dakota Community was established by treaty in 1851. The treaty set aside a 10-mile wide strip of land on both sides of the Minnesota River as the permanent home of the Dakota. However, in the aftermath of the U.S.-Dakota Conflict of 1862, Congress abrogated all treaties made with them and the Dakota were forced from their homes in the state. The four communities were reestablished in their current localities by acts of Congress in 1886. The four Dakota Communities today represent small segments of the original reservation that were restored to the Dakota by Acts of Congress or Proclamations of the Secretary of Interior.” Lastly, the photo of men hanging from a gallows that appears with the eRumor is likely not a photo of the actual Dakota execution. The photo doesn’t exist in the Minnesota Historical Society’s archive , and the men in the photo are dressed like Europeans, not Dakota. It’s highly unlikely that Minnesotans would have given Dakota men new pants, vests and coats before their execution. In the end, a lot of factors led to the Dakota conflict and the fallout that followed it. Arguments can be made that the Dakota were treated unfairly, but its wrong to pin all the blame for the mass execution on Lincoln, as this eRumor attempts to do. ","Politics"
"Damage to the White House during trasition from Clinton to Bush-Truth!","2015-03-17 16:37:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/trashingthewhitehouse/"," When George W. Bush took over the presidency in 2001, his new staff arrived in the offices of the White House to find that there had been widespread pranks and vandalism by the departing Clinton staff.  Published reports said computers were left unusable, pornography was found on both computers and walls, and telephone systems were trashed by the cutting of cables and wires. "," The final, official report from the Government Accounting Office was released on June 11, 2002.  The 220 page document says there was damage, although not as much as some of the early reports had suggested.  The GAO says the damage included 62 missing computer keyboards, 26 cell phones, two cameras, ten antique doorknobs and several presidential medallions and office signs.  The damage estimate was about $20,000.  Clinton critics say the report   proves that the departing Clinton staff members acted recklessly and   disrespectfully.  Clinton supporters say the report shows that   the allegations of vandalism were exaggerated and that there were similar incidents when Clinton took over the White House from   the staff of George Bush. The GAO report concludes that even though damage was verified and   that some of it appeared to have been intentional, there was not   clear evidence of who was responsible for it. This   has been a subject of contention since President Bush took   office.  There were reports of  vandalism, graffiti, and   obscene messages in White House offices by outgoing Clinton   staffers.  Bush downplayed the reports saying he wanted to move   on with the presidency.  Clinton supporters, however, charged   that the story was not true and that the Bush forces had made up the   story  to make Bush’s staff look better than Clinton’s.    Former President Clinton offered to pay for any damage and his   supporters called for an investigation. May 18, 2001 the General Accounting Office issued a three-page   letter that said that it was unable confirm the damage largely to a   lack of records from the White House.  The letter also said   that the   condition of the White House offices was “…consistent with what we would expect to   encounter when tenants vacate office space after an extended   occupancy.”  As to any details of damage, the GAO letter   said For supporters of former President Clinton, that seemed to end   the matter.  They proclaimed victory, called the whole story an   urban legend, and asked the White House to apologize. In response, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer outlined the   details of the damage, most of which was in the Eisenhower Execitive   Office Building adjacent to the White House.  On June 3, 2001 The Washington Post   quoted Fleischer as saying that the damage included the removal of   the letter “W”   from 100 computer keyboards, five missing brass nameplates with the   presidential seal on them, 75 telephones with cover plates missing   or apparently intentionally plugged into the  wrong wall outlets, six   fax machines relocated in the same way, ten cut phone lines, two   historic door knobs missing, overturned desks and furniture in about   20 percent of the offices, obscene graffiti in six offices, and   eight 14-foot loads of usable office supplies recovered from the   trash.  According to Fleischer, there was one incident in the White House itself, a   photocopy machine that had copies of naked people hidden in the   paper tray so they would come out from time to time with other   copies. Critics of the Bush administration said they didn’t trust the White   House report. On June 5, 2001, the General Accounting Office announced that it had   launched an investigation into the matter, which was released on June 11, 2002. There was a companion story that Air Force One had been the victim of the outgoing Clintons and that numerous items from aboard the plane had been pilfered.  President Bush himself told reporters aboard Air Force one on February 12, 2001, that the report was not true.  According to Salon Washington correspondent Jake Tipper, Bush brought up the subject because the chief steward aboard Air Force One told him the allegations were false.","Politics"

"Ted Kennedy Sent a Secret Letter to the Soviets in 1983-Truth!","2015-03-13 02:27:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ted-kennedy-sent-a-secret-letter-to-the-soviets-in-1983/"," Ted Kennedy asked leaders of the Soviet Union to help the Democrats defeat President Reagan in the 1984 presidential election in a secret letter that he sent in 1983. "," This eRumor is true. Sen. Ted Kennedy wrote the letter to Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov in 1983. In the letter, Kennedy reportedly talked about his concerns with U.S.-Soviet relations, and about President Reagan’s plan to deploy middle range nuclear weapons to Western Europe. Ted Kennedy’s original letter to Soviet leaders hasn’t turned up. But Kennedy’s letter was discussed in a memo from KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov to Yuri Andropov that turned up in 1992. According to the memo : “The only real threats to Reagan are problems of war and peace and Soviet-American relations. These issues, according to the senator, will without a doubt become the most important of the election campaign. The movement advocating a freeze on nuclear arsenals of both countries continues to gain strength in the United States. The movement is also willing to accept preparations, particularly from Kennedy, for its continued growth. In political and influential circles of the country, including within Congress, the resistance to growing military expenditures is gaining strength. “However, according to Kennedy, the opposition to Reagan is still very weak. Reagan’s adversaries are divided and the presentations they make are not fully effective. Meanwhile, Reagan has the capabilities to effectively counter any propaganda.” The memo goes on to discuss Ted Kennedy’s request for Yuri Andropov to invite him to Moscow for a meeting. Kennedy reportedly said that he could provide “explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the U.S.A.” Kennedy said he had similar meetings planned with British and French leaders. Ted Kennedy also requested that Yuri Andropov do a number of interviews on American television, according to the memo : “A direct appeal by the General Secretary to the American people will, without a doubt, attract a great deal of attention and interest in the country. The senator is convinced this would receive the maximum resonance in so far as television is the most effective method of mass media and information.” Kennedy also reportedly said he was “very impressed” with the Soviet’s commitment to “heal international affairs, and improve mutual understandings between people.” Historian Paul Kengor wrote about the memo in his book, “The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism.” Kengor explained in a 2008 interview how the document had been discovered: “It comes from the Central Committee archives of the former USSR. Once Boris Yeltsin took over Russia in 1991, he immediately began opening the Soviet archives, which led to a rush on the archives by Western researchers. One of them, Tim Sebastian of the London Times and BBC, found the Kennedy document and reported it in the February 2, 1992 edition of the Times, in an article titled, ‘Teddy, the KGB and the top secret file.’ “But this electrifying revelation stopped there; it went no further. Never made it across the Atlantic. Not a single American news organization, from what I can tell, picked up the story. Apparently, it just wasn’t interesting enough, nor newsworthy. Reports of the Ted Kennedy-KGB memo went viral after a group of Republican senators sent an open letter to leaders of Iran about ongoing nuclear negotiations. This sparked a debate about senators undermining presidents and brought new attention to the Kennedy memo. ","Politics"

A Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs told TruthOrFiction.com that the delay was normal and had nothing to do with the President’s departure from the area. This portion of the Air Force Academy graduation was something to see. At the very end of the graduation ceremony the Master of Ceremonies announced that the Class of 2012 was dismissed.  At that moment the graduates tossed their combination caps in the air and the Thunderbirds perform their flyover. Once the caps are in the air children from the audience are released into the graduate area to retrieve the tossed caps and are allowed to keep them as a souvenir. The children are then escorted to an area where their parents can meet up with them to return them to their seats. An information page showing the scheduled events involving the graduation is posted on the Academy web site, which shows the air show beginning approximately thirty minutes after the close of the graduation ceremony.

Updated 2013: President Obama spoke at the U.S. Naval academy commencement ceremony on May 24, 2013 .   It is not required that a sitting U.S. President attend the commencement ceremonies every year for all the military academies.   Vice President Biden spoke to the class of 2009 and Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley was the 2013 commencement speaker at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 2013 the Thunderbirds were unable to make the traditional flyover because of sequestration but their was a flyover of historical World War II aircraft by the Texas Flying Legends.  This according to an article in the Commemorative Air Force web site .  The article said, ‘Support for these flyovers is also being provided by the Texas Flying Legends, Commemorative Air Force and the National Museum of World War II Aviation.”  The Commemorative Air Force is an organization that was founded to “acquire, restore and preserve in flying condition a complete collection of combat aircraft which were flown by all military services of the United States.” Posted 06/18/12   Updated 06./04/13 ","Politics"
