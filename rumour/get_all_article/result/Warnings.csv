"Creepy Clown Sightings Have Nation on Edge-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-10-06 09:54:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/creepy-clown-sightings-nation-edge/"," Reports of “creepy clowns,” some of which have allegedly tried to lure or abduct children, have cause panic around the country. "," There has been a rash of suspicious clown sightings across the country, but most of them seem to be marketing stunts. The earliest report of a creepy clown sighting came in August 2016 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. People there reported seeing a creepy clown emerging from the shadows at night holding three black balloons. However, the sightings were quickly chalked up to an online marketing campaign for a short film that was shot in the area that stars “Gags,” a creepy clown, the Green Bay Press Gazette reports : It turns out, that was the point. The handful of dimly lit photos of a sinister-looking clown with a clutch of black balloons, dubbed “Gags,” was the first salvo in an online marketing campaign for a locally produced short film. Adam Krause, of Green Bay, announced on Facebook this week that “Gags” is the title of an upcoming short film for which he is the writer, producer and director. Gags the Clown’s official Facebook page was created Aug. 2. Krause wrote on Facebook that he hoped he and others involved with the film could use social media to create a small viral campaign that would reach a couple hundred people. The first photos of Gags were shared tens of thousands of times, exceeding Krause’s initial expectations. The attention ignited a social media firestorm that attracted all kinds of people who, whether they thought it funny or terrifying, could not help but click the “share” button. In a week and a half the page has more than 50,000 likes on Facebook, and news stories have appeared as far away as Ireland, Brazil and Germany. The viral marketing campaign was clearly a success, with Gags’ Facebook page generating nearly 60,000 “likes” in a matter of weeks. Naturally, others wanted to steal a page from Gags’ playbook and use the creepy clown idea to attract attention to haunted houses, haunted mazes and other spooky attractions with Halloween approaching. One example came in Columbus, Ohio, where unexplained creepy clown sightings set the area on edge until the clowns were identified as a marketing stunt led by a local haunted house attraction, an NBC affiliate reports : Mark Del Negro made the video with his partners to promote the first Scare Fest taking place at the Eastern States Exposition Storrowton Village from October 13th to Halloween. Mark said it took them three tries to get the video right and no one walking along was included. It’s enough to keep you up at night even if you aren’t scared of clowns. The men behind the mask say this is top of the line prosthetics straight from Hollywood because they’ve worked on film productions in the past. Del Negro said the reactions have been mostly positive, but said he had to tell one neighbor it was fake, “He actually thought it was real and was actually ready to create a mob to go and look for the clown. I had to tell him that. I was like dude that was a fake video don’t get all upset about it. On his Facebook post he said, ‘they picked the wrong town’ and he’s a big dude and I was like dude we didn’t pick any town it was like five minutes away from my house.” Del Negro said he apologizes to anyone that may have been offended, “We were never intending to put anyone in danger or scare anyone. We were just trying to make a really bad viral video with our cell phone and I guess it was better than the actual commercials we paid for.” Similar accounts of creepy clown marketing stunts have been reported around the country. Mixed in, however, are a few yet-to-be explained clown sightings. There were numerous reports of creepy clowns trying to lure or abduct children in North Carolina that haven’t yet been explained, a local ABC affiliate reports : The ‘clown’ was described as wearing white overalls, white gloves, red shoes with red bushy hair, a white face and a red nose. The suspect allegedly tried to lure the kids with treats, and was reportedly seen by two children and heard – but not seen – by one adult. The suspect fled the area when officers arrived. A second clown sighting happened just after midnight in the 1600 block of Hope Lane, two miles from the first sighting. Officers attempted to locate the subject but were unsuccessful. Both spots where clowns were reported are in very residential areas near parks/woods. Similar incidents have occurred in South Carolina. Those clown sightings hadn’t been linked to any marketing stunts. It’s not clear whether they were actual child abductions or someone playing a prank — but ABC reported that sales of clown costumes were up 300 percent in the area due to a growing national obsession with creepy clowns. And there have been false reports from Reading, Pennsylvania, about a man wearing a clown mask stabbed a 16-year-old boy to death. The tragic incident happened, but it was actually the 16-year-old victim who was wearing the clown mask — not the man who stabbed him, the Associated Press reports : READING (AP) — Police say a dispute over a mask like one featured in the “Purge” horror movies contributed to the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy. Reading police say high school sophomore Christian Torres had the mask pushed up onto his head, not over his face, when he was stabbed Sunday night. Twenty-nine-year-old Avery Valentin-Bair has been jailed on first-degree murder and other charges. Police had said earlier this week that they were sifting through various accounts that included the victim wearing a clown-like mask, and someone else wearing it. Police now say Torres had the mask and that it had created some sort of neighborhood controversy that led to the stabbing. So, most of the accounts of creepy clown sightings can be chalked up to viral marketing stunts, or copycats dressing as clowns for amusement. However, there are some unexplained reports of clowns trying to lure children in North Carolina and South Carolina. We haven’t found any evidence that a person in a clown costume has actually abducted or harmed a child, but law enforcement is taking the threats seriously. Even the White House has weighed in on the matter. ","Warnings"

"," While it’s very possible for rogue apps or malware to post offensive comments under your name, we couldn’t find any instances of this so-called “latest Facebook hack” actually happening. The post warns that hackers have been able to post offensive content between the comments on a contact’s post so that it appears to have come from your account. Even worse, the post warns, these offensive comments are impossible for you to see, which “can create hurt and misunderstandings” between you and your contacts. Again, we couldn’t find any examples of that actually happening. It’s impossible for offensive content to be posted “between the comments” unless a rogue app or malware infect your Facebook account. And, while that’s a very real threat, it’s not a “new hack” at all. Malware has been known to post content (including porn and offensive comments) with its victims’ accounts since the beginning of Facebook. Malware also tags its victims contacts in these posts to trick other people into clicking on links that will infect their devices with the same virus. If you notice unauthorized posts or comments coming from your account, immediately click the “V” dropdown icon in the upper right hand corner and remove any friends that have been tagged. Then, delete the post and check your apps to locate the source of malware. Follow these steps to remove any suspicious applications.

"Warnings About Facebook Cloning Scams-Truth!","2016-06-23 13:47:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/warnings-facebook-cloning-scams/"," Warnings about Facebook cloning, in which scammers use your name and photo to create an identical Facebook account in order to scam your friends and family, have gone viral. "," Threats about Facebook cloning are accurate, but the scam has been around for years and there didn’t appear to be a heightened risk for it happening when this warning went viral. The website Facecrooks , which publishes information about scams targeting Facebook users, first reported about Facebook cloning scams in 2012. The article described the scam like this: The most common scenario is someone copies the name, profile picture and other available photos of their intended victim. The next thing they do is block the person they are impersonating and send friend requests to everyone on the victim’s friends list. This is done to infiltrate their social network. Once this part of the mission is complete, the scammer has a variety of options at their disposal. In 2014, a sheriff’s department in Kentucky issued an official alert about a Facebook cloning scam that had victimized five people in the county: According to Sheriff Johnny Bivens, one such occurrence recently included the page of April Justice. A cloned page appeared on Facebook and began sending messages to friends of the real Justice. “She has been sick for a while and in the hospital,” Bivens said. “Someone was sending messages from a page exactly like hers saying times were tough for the family and asking to borrow money.” Bivens said from the research he has done on the cloned pages, it does not look like someone locally is doing it. “It doesn’t look like it’s someone here,” he said. “But, it is happening to people in our county.” CBS Boston had a similar report about Facebook cloning scams targeting the area back in 2014 as well. So, scammers can use Facebook cloning to access information from your friends and family that can be used to scam them out of money, as was the case in Tennessee.. Scammers can also use Facebook cloning to spread spam across trusted friend networks, or to simply bully their victims. There are a number of steps you can take to protect yourself from Facebook cloning scams. First, make your friends list private so that only you can see it following these steps from Facebook . Second, don’t accept friend requests from people you don’t, and don’t accept friend requests from people who you’re already friends with. Also, alert friends or family members who suddenly try to re-friend you, and report any cloning scams to Facebook by following steps listed here . ","Warnings"
"Sea Lice Attacking Florida’s Beaches-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-06-08 13:11:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sea-lice-attacking-floridas-beaches-truth-misleading/"," Warnings that sea lice have invaded beaches in Florida have sparked panic on social media. "," Warnings about sea lice on Florida beaches are true — but they’re also misleading. Posts began circulating on social media in early June that warned Florida beachgoers of sea lice “invasions” that have left swimmers with painful red welts all over their bodies, like the one pictured here: The photo is real, and it was circulated by Florida public health officials in a warning about sea lice or “seabather’s eruption,” at beaches. Sea lice are actually the larvae of jellyfish, which are nearly invisible in ocean waters but leave simmers with painful red welts on their skin, according to public health officials : For the past 11 years, during the months of March through August, residents and tourists along 250 miles of Florida’s southern Atlantic coastline have complained of an annoying pruritic rash, primarily within areas covered by bathing suits. Although this problem has existed since the early 1900s at least, it has not been formally recognized and understood until recently. The first study (a retrospective case review of ED cases seen during 1992) and a sample population survey were conducted at Boca Raton Community Hospital. The outbreaks appear to have intensified in the last 4 years, as reflected in the number of cases reported as well as the severity of response in individual cases. Because most affected people treat themselves, it is difficult to determine the total annual number of cases. However, a conservative estimate of 10,000 cases in 1992 can be made. So, the phenomenon isn’t new, and most residents of Florida and other warm weather states are well aware of sea lice. In 2016, sea lice outbreaks appeared to be cropping up further west in the Gulf of Mexico than in year’s past, and headed toward Alabama beaches, an NBC affiliate reports . We’re calling warnings about sea lice true, but misleading. Sea lice isn’t necessarily new, and there doesn’t seem to be a greater risk of swimmers being affected by it in 2016 than in year’s past.

"Shred Your Airline Boarding Passes-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-01-22 11:31:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/shred-your-airline-boarding-passes/"," Airline travelers have been told to shred their boarding passes because scammers can retrieve personal information by scanning a barcode. "," Bar codes on boarding passes do contain personal information, but not much more than is already printed on your boarding pass in plain text. Calls for airline travelers to shred their boarding passes emerged in October 2015. That’s when security blogger Brian Krebs published a blog post headlined, “What’s in a Board Pass Barcode? A lot,” at KrebsonSecurity.com : The next time you’re thinking of throwing away a used boarding pass with a barcode on it, consider tossing the boarding pass into a document shredder instead. Two-dimensional barcodes and QR codes can hold a great deal of information, and the codes printed on airline boarding passes may allow someone to discover more about you, your future travel plans, and your frequent flyer account. Earlier this year, I heard from a longtime KrebsOnSecurity reader named Cory who said he began to get curious about the data stored inside a boarding pass barcode after a friend put a picture of his boarding pass up on Facebook. Cory took a screen shot of the boarding pass, enlarged it, and quickly found a site online that could read the data. “I found a website that could decode the data and instantly had lots of info about his trip,” Cory said, showing this author step-by-step exactly how he was able to find this information. Krebs wrote that the reader was able to retrieve the passenger’s name, frequent flier number and a “record key” for the Lufthansa flight. Then, with the record key, the reader was supposedly able to gain access to the traveler’s entire account and could have changed passwords and pin numbers. That’s where the threat of boarding pas security gets murky, however. To gain access to a secured account, you need to enter a pre-set password and pin number, or answer security questions to reset them. That info isn’t in a boarding pass barcode. In Krebs example, the hacker knew his “victim” and knew the answer to the security question, “What’s your mother’s maiden name?” More often than not, that wouldn’t be the case. Also, Brian Salzman, the VP of marketing for Inlite Research, the company that makes the online scanner cited by Krebs, said barcodes don’t have much more information that is already printed on the boarding pass, Fusion reports : I also reached out to Inlite Research, the company that put the free barcode scanner online that Krebs pointed people to. The site got a surge of traffic last week said Michael Salzman, Inlite’s VP of Marketing. He was nonplussed by the privacy freak-out. “Isn’t most of that information on the boarding pass itself?” Salzman said. “Barcodes are not inherently secure or insecure. Barcodes are a dumb way to package information into an image. The nature of the information is up to the people who use it.” Fusion reporter Kashmir Hill scanned boarding passes from many different airlines and found in all cases that the frequent flier number was the only bit of personal information not already printed on the ticket. Boarding pass barcodes have been in wide use since 2005. That year, the International Air Transport Association undertook a five-year long project to establish Bar Coded Boarding Passes (BCBP) in all of its member airlines . Tech blogger Shaun Ewing delved into the science of BCBP and outlined exactly what information is “hidden” inside boarding pass barcodes on at his blog site, Shaun.net : EWING/SHAUN: My name. E1AAAAA: Electronic ticket indicator and my booking reference. SYDBNEQF: Flying from SYD (Sydney) to BNE (Brisbane) on QF (Qantas). 0524: Flight number 524. 106: The Julian date. In this case 106 is April 16. Y: Cabin – Economy in this case. Others including F (First) and J (Business). 23A: My seat. 0073: My sequence number. In this case I was the 73rd person to check-in. 3: My “passenger status”. 59: There is a various size field. This is the size >: Beginning of the version number 2: The version number. 18: Field size of another variable field. 0: My check-in source. B: Airline designator of boarding pass issuer. 2: Another variable size field. 9: Airline code. 0: International document verification. ’0′ as I presume is not applicable. QF: The airline my frequent flyer account is with. 1245678: My frequent flyer number. 128: Airline specific data. Ewing found that the barcode information was “harmless,” but he advised against leaving boarding passes behind in seat pockets or posting photos of them online. To summarize, it’s true that there’s information in boarding pass barcodes, but the threat level has been overblown. And, no, you don’t need to shred your boarding passes. ","Warnings"
"Sex-Trafficking Ring Targets Teens at Michigan Movie Theater-Fiction!","2016-01-08 09:48:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sex-trafficking-ring-targets-teens-at-michigan-movie-theater/"," Social media posts warn that a woman with candy and jewelry targeted three teen girls for human trafficking at a movie theater in Pontiac, Michigan. "," This warning about a human trafficking ring taking place in Michigan is from 2012, and local police investigated the report for days before ruling that it was false. Warnings about the so-called human trafficking ring targeting teens in Michigan popped up on social media sites again in November 2015. It’s not clear why, but the Auburn Hills Police Department has confirmed that there are no new developments in the case, and no reason to believe there’s a threat. As told on social media, the story goes that three teen girls went to a movie at the Great Lakes Crossing movie theater, where a woman kept “popping up in front of the girls” with Starburst candies and jewelry. After the girls refused the woman’s offerings, they approached security and learned there is a sex trafficking ring operating in Pontiac: Traffickers use a powder-like drug that absorbs into the skin to gain victims for prostitution (what was most likely in the candy or on the jewelry). Please do not go to Great Lakes Alone! This is a very real operation going on and has been confirmed by multiple authorities. Contrary to that warning, authorities have not confirmed the so-called sex-trafficking ring. There is some truth to the story, however. A group of teen girls at the Great Lakes Theater were offered candy and jewelry by another group of teens at the theater. After refusing the offer, the teen girls reported the teens to security because they believed the items they were offered might have been stolen. Then, days later, one of the girls reported the encounter to school officials, not police, according to an Auburn Hills Police report : When the Auburn Hills Police Department found out about this alleged incident they contacted the girls and their parents. One parent refused to allow us to speak with her daughter. The girls told us the facts of the encounter which are detailed above. The girls stated they never felt like they were being lured into something or going to be kidnapped. They stated it was kids about their age offering candy and jewelry that they thought were probably stolen. They told security and left because it was close to one of the girls curfew. They felt the parent that reported it to their high school overreacted and was making a bigger deal out of it then was needed. After spending days tracking down and interviewing witnesses, police ruled that it was nothing more than a strange encounter between two groups of teens. There was no kidnapping or sex trafficking involved. This social media warning is false. ","Warnings"
"Thieves Using Penny Jammed in Car Door Handle-Fiction!","2016-01-05 10:59:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/thieves-using-penny-in-car-door-handle/"," Jamming a penny in a car door handle prevents automatic locks from working and allows thieves to easily steal your possessions, according to online warnings. "," We haven’t been able to find any credible reports of thieves using a penny in a door handle to break into cars, and warnings about that happening can easily be picked apart. Penny in a door handle warnings surfaced on blog sites in early January 2016. These warnings claim that a thief can place a penny in a passenger-side door handle to prevent the central locking system from working. Then, when you return home in the evening, a thief can easily break into your unlocked car because the penny in the door handle prevented the locking system from working. The first fatal flaw with the penny in the door theory is that door handles aren’t designed to open when they’re only opened slightly. The width of a penny (.0598 inches) wouldn’t open a car door handle enough to trigger the unlatching mechanism connected to the door handle. Also, most cars with central locking systems have car door sensors that signal when all four or five doors are opened or closed. So, if a penny or coin were thick enough to unlatch the door handle, you’d receive a “door ajar” dashboard alert. Modern cars have separate door latch sensors for each door, so you’d immediately know if the sensor’s circuit weren’t completed. Ehow.com reports : The way the sensors work can vary. One type of sensor can be an electrical proximity one for the “your door is ajar” signal. On the vehicle itself would be a wafer-thin magnetic strip; the door would have an opposing strip that has a wire running inside the door and into the junction box. The junction box would then have another wire running into the car’s computer that has yet another wire attached to a small speaker in your dash board. As long as the door was closed, the magnetic strip on the door could read the opposite one on the car, keeping the electrical circuit closed. But if the car door was open and the door magnet was too far away from the car magnet, the circuit would be open. The computer would then read that the door circuit is now open. It would send a signal to the speaker to make the announcement that your car door is ajar. We also tried the penny in the door trick on multiple cars, and it didn’t work on any of them. Because there haven’t been any credible reports of thieves using the penny in the car door trick, and various parts of the warning can easily be shot down based on how car doors and sensor system work, we’re calling this one fiction.","Warnings"
"CDC Warns of Condoms Being Used as Hair Bands-Fiction!","2015-12-04 10:50:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cdc-warns-of-condoms-being-used-as-hair-bands/"," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued a warning that manufacturers in China are making condoms into hair ties. "," A fake news website is behind false reports that the CDC issued a warning about condoms being made into hairbands. This rumor isn’t a new one, either. We first investigated reports that Chinese manufacturers were making condoms into hair ties back in 2007. We cautiously reported that the story was true because we found a credible report from Chinese media about it. Click here to read our previous findings. The hair tie condom story has popped up numerous times over the years. Chinese media once again reported that people had commented online that they’d purchased cheap, brightly colored hairbands from street vendors in southwest China’s Chongqing district only to find condoms inside. Those reports didn’t identify the manufacturers of the alleged hairband condoms, or vet the consumer reports. Then, in Novemer 2015, an American fake news website called Now News 8 picked up the rumor with a false report headlined, “CDC Warns: Hair Bands From China Made of Used Condoms, Could Spread STDs.” According to the report: The Center For Disease Control (CDC) is warning Americans that used condoms have been reportedly reprocessed into rubber bands and hair ties and have been sold in the United States, raising concerns about public health safety. Aside from being sold at local swap meets and flea markets, the recycled condoms have been found at local beauty salons all across the country. The CDC says this threatens the health of consumers who are using these products and are concerned that using these hair ties and rubber bands could lead to the spread of AIDS, genital warts and other STD’s. The CDC has released this statement: “The amount of bacteria and potential viruses on these hair ties and rubber bands, which are made from used unsanitary condoms, has 4 times the bacteria found on a public restroom toilet. Consumers could potentially be infected with AIDS, warts, herpes and other venereal diseases if they hold the rubber bands or hair ties in their mouths while setting their hair. We warn against consumers purchasing these products if they were made in China.” The CDC has not issued a warning about condoms being made into hairbands, and there were no new credible reports of that happening when the Now 8 News report went viral. Now 8 News is one of many fake news websites that appears to look like a local news station in an effort to duping readers into believing it’s stories are true. If you travel to China, it’s probably wise to avoid buying hairbands from street vendors. For shoppers in the U.S., however, there are no credible threats (or CDC warnings) about condoms being made into hairbands. ","Warnings"
"Beware of Burundanga on Business Cards-Truth! & Unverified!","2015-11-16 09:02:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beware-of-burundanga-on-business-cards/"," A viral warning claims that a drug called burundanga on a business card poisoned a woman and advises people to beware of what has become known as “the zombie drug.” "," Burundanga is a real drug, but a story about a woman poisoned by burundanga on a business card that has been circulating the web for years is unverified. First, let’s start with what’s true about this viral email warning. Burundanga is derived from trees that grow in the jungles of South America. It’s also called Devil’s Breath, scopolamine or simply “the zombie drug.” It has been used in the medical community to prevent vomiting and motion sickness, but it has become known as “ the world’s scariest drug ” in the underworld drug trade. In a Vice documentary, a drug dealer in Columbia described how burundanga could be blown into someone’s face and within minutes, “you can guide them wherever you want. It’s like they’re a child.” That’s because the zombie drug blocks the brain’s ability to form memories and strips its victims of free will and reason for days at a time. Reports of burundanga poisoning aren’t uncommon in South America. Criminals often use the drugs to sexually assault or rob their victims. The South American publication El Mundo reported in 2013 that a criminal group had used handwritten notes laced with burundanga to poison four victims — which sounds a lot like burundanga on a business card email warning: (An unknown woman) approached insistently with a small paper with handwritten text while following her as she continued to walk in the company of her two minor children. About 100 meters from the first contact, the affected relates, “I felt something in my head, I began to feel dizzy, legs weighed me while asking me where I was, whether he was married or how many children they had.” We can confirm that burundaga is a real drug used by criminals to leave their victims in a zombie-like trance for days, but we have not been able to verify the specific account of burundanga on a business card poisoning a woman. In fact, we weren’t able to find any accounts of burundanga being used on victims in the U.S. So, many of the details about burundanga from the warning email are true, but we cannot confirm any cases of the drug being used outside of South America.

"Beware of New Gummy Bear Drugs this Halloween-Mostly Fiction!","2015-10-14 10:39:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beware-of-new-gummy-bear-drugs-this-halloween/"," Parents should be on the lookout for a new street drug that looks like gummy bears that could be given out as Halloween candy. "," Street drugs can be made to look like gummy bears, but there wasn’t a specific threat of them being given out as Halloween candy when this rumor went viral. A warning that surfaced on infunny.co, a website that allows users to share memes and gifs, shows pictures of oversized gummy bears with the following warning: Okay so there is a new drug on the streets that are in the form of a gummy bear, gummy worm etc. This Halloween if you get handed a gummy bear in (an) irregular package DON’T RECEIVE IT! It is known to put you in a coma, make you brain dead and/or death. As Halloween approached, the image went viral and left many questioning whether there actually was a new street drug that looks like gummy bears, and if there’s a threat that it could be given out as a Halloween candy. First, there is a new street drug that takes the shape of gummy bears. The crystal-like synthetic drug was first found during a drug bust in Miami in June. The drug, which can be swallowed, smoked or injected, causes hallucinations and paranoia, CBS Miami reports : During a narcotics bust, Miami-Dade Police said they found what looked like candy in a zip lock bag. Turns out, it was laced with a synthetic drug similar to Flakka and bath salts. It’s a crystal-like drug that is cheap, addictive and deadly .It can be swallowed, smoked or injected and often causes hallucinations and paranoia. “There’s been a lot of medical problems,” said Criminalist Stephen Snipes. In this case, narcotics detectives say the drug mimicked the candy’s sugar coating. It looked almost identical to regular gummies but they were stickier and individually wrapped. “The crystal was crushed up and a piece of candy was rolled in the crystals,” said Snipes. “It wasn’t as flexible and it was much stickier than the actual commercial product and it was individually wrapped.” While this is Miami-Dade’s first case, police are warning the community to be on the look out. The drug has led people to have numerous run-ins with South Florida authorities, some with deadly consequences. Still, even though the warning that went viral makes credible warnings about a new street drug made to look like gummy bears, there’s no specific threat of it being given out this Halloween. Each year as Halloween approaches, warnings about Halloween candy being laced with drugs, poison or razor blades go viral. TruthorFiction.com researched a similar rumor that the drug Ecstasy has been made to look like candy is being given out this Halloween, for example. But in reality, there have been no confirmed reports of children being poisoned from Halloween candy that was handed out by strangers. The only confirmed case of poison by Halloween candy came in Texas in 1974 when a father named Ronald Clark O’Bryan poisoned his own child’s Halloween candy with cyanide in a life insurance scam, Mental Floss magazine reports : A bit of digging revealed that Ronald O’Bryan had recently taken out hefty life insurance policies on both of his children, and police quickly built a case, albeit a circumstantial one, that O’Bryan had given both Timothy and his daughter, Elizabeth, the poison candy to try to collect on the policies. To help cover his tracks, O’Bryan also gave two other children cyanide Pixy Stix. Luckily, his daughter and the other two children had passed up the poisoned powders in favor of other treats. O’Bryan was eventually convicted and executed for murdering his son. While his crime was certainly a horrific one, it was hardly the sort of random poisoning that parents fear. Still, parents are always urged to be cautious when allowing their children to accept Halloween candy from strangers.

Rarely, but on occasion, when those fibers combine together while being formed, they create a shiny particle, similar to what was found by this consumer. Huggies said that no injuries had been reported, and its wipes were safe to use. The company did add, however, that it was investigating the original complaint and engaging with other parents who had voiced concerns. A spokesperson for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said via Twitter that the commission was “looking into reports of glass in baby wipes.” Consumers can file complaints about Huggies baby wipes at safeproducts.gov.

"Common Houseplant Can Kill Children in Under a Minute-Fiction!","2015-07-31 14:00:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/common-houseplant-can-kill-children-in-under-a-minute/"," A forwarded email claims that a common houseplant is so toxic that it can kill a child in less than a minute and an adult in less than 15 minutes. "," This killer houseplant claim is mostly false. A forwarded email warning shows a picture of a common houseplant that has wide leaves that are green and cream-colored. The email warns that this is a killer houseplant: This plant is common in Rwanda, in many offices and in homes. It is a deadly poison, mainly for the children. It can kill a kid in less than a minute and an adult in 15 minutes. It should be uprooted from gardens and taken out of offices. If touched, one should never touch ones eyes; it can cause permanent blindness. Please alert your buddies. The so-called killer houseplant in the picture is actually a dieffenbachia, more commonly known as a “dumb cane.”  It’s true that the dumb cane is toxic, but this email warning overstates the potential for danger. The British Columbia Drug and Poison Information Centre lists the dumb cane in its poison information database, but its warnings are pretty mild: Is it toxic? All parts of the plant contain needle-like oxalate crystals. If the plant is chewed the crystals are released and can cause intense pain and possible swelling of the mouth. Health Effects: Skin: Potential burning and itching from contact with the “juice ” of the plant. Handling of intact leaves is unlikely to cause symptoms. Ingestion: Immediate pain and burning sensation of the mouth and lips. Possible swelling and blisters in mouth; more likely to occur if stem is chewed. What to do? Skin: Wash skin with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. Ingestion: Rinse out mouth and drink a glass of milk. Sucking on a popsicle or an ice cube can help relieve discomfort in mouth. Eating some ice cream may also help If symptoms persist after the above first aid measures contact the Poison Control Centre. How can I prevent exposure?  Keep plant out of reach of small children. Wear gloves when cutting or trimming the plant. The plant is called the dumb cane because it causes swelling of the mouth so severe that it’s victim can’t talk, the website Our Houseplants reports . So, the dumb cane can have very unpleasant side effects, but the claim that it’s a killer houseplant is false. ","Warnings"

"," The bottom line is that there are no documented cases that anyone can find of gas fumes being ignited by a cell phone. The issue is not a simple one, however, because some oil companies have issued bans on cell phones at their stations and cell phone manufacturers have printed warnings about using their equipment around fuel vapors. Some observers say that the warnings are reactions to the false rumors of explosions and deaths caused by cell phones. One of the eRumors describes three occasions of fires from cell phones: A man who was burned when a cell phone sitting on a bumper rang and caused and explosion; a man who was burned in the face while talking on his phone as he was pumping gas; a man whose phone caused a fire in the pocket of his pants while pumping gas.  There’s no proof that any of the stories is true. Another oft-repeated story comes from Adelaide, Australia where, it is said, an explosion at a gas station in 1999 was caused by a man using a cell phone.  A spokesperson for the the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service says, however, there was no cell phone involved in the fire and he doesn’t know how the rumor about the cell phone got started.  The incident was mentioned in a 1999 article in The Bankok Post, which also said that a man from Indonesia was burned when his cell phone caused an explosion at a gas station. No substantiation has ever been found. A wire service story circulated in 1999 out of Trail, British Columbia that said a man caught fire when the cell phone he was using caused an explosion while he filled his gas tank at a gas station.  It caused quite a stir in Canada, but was later declared an urban legend. Cell phone makers including Motorola and Nokia have included warnings about not using cell phones around gas vapors.  In August of 1999, David Rudd, a spokesman for Motorola, told the San Francisco Chronicle that his company’s warning was because of the remote possibility that a dislodged battery cause cause a spark, not because of the transmission of radio signals. After stories started circulating in 1999 about explosions caused by cell phones, many companies began issuing bans on cell phone use at their gas stations including Chevron, Union 76, Circle K, Shell, Petro-Canada, Esso, and Exxon.  Portable phones have been banned at gas stations in parts of Europe for many years, but Nokia spokesperson Megan Matthews told the Associated press on Jan 14, 1999 that those rules were from a bygone era when portable phones were more powerful than modern phones and that the bans were rarely enforced.

And the cell phone gun is real, but it’s not on the market yet. The company says the patent is pending, and that it will be marketed to legal firearms enthusiasts at NRA shows — not criminals. After his post was shared nearly 100,000 times, Karl de la Guerra clarified in a follow up post that he didn’t mean to imply that cell phone gun shouldn’t be sold, or that it would only be sold to criminals. He said his intent was to note that it could pose a threat to law enforcement officials: And reports about cell guns are nothing new. The first one we investigated dates back to 2000. Back then, European officials issued a warning that .22 caliber guns were being manufactured to look like cellular telephones.  Travelers were warned to be careful around airports in particular because they authorities were having to contend with judging whether cell phones carried by air passengers may be lethal. There were many media accounts of these cell-guns including. Much of the information that has been repeated around the Internet was included in a report by Lucrezia Cuen of ABC News on December 6, 2000: At first sight it looks like a regular cell phone — same size, same shape, same overall appearance. But beneath the digital face lies a .22-caliber pistol — a phone gun capable of firing four rounds in quick succession with a touch of the otherwise standard keypad. European law enforcement officials — stunned by the discovery of these deadly decoys — say phone guns are changing the rules of engagement in Europe. “We find it very, very alarming,” says Wolfgang Dicke of the German Police union. “It means police will have to draw their weapons whenever a person being checked reaches for their mobile phone.” Authorities warned that cell-gun can fire four .22 caliber rounds, and that they posed a particular risk to travelers.

"Scam Artists Are Working out of Area Code 809, 284, or 876-Truth! & Fiction! ","2015-03-17 21:57:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/area809/"," The email warns never to call area code 809, 284, or 876 because you could get charged $25 or more per minute for the call.  It goes on to describe various ways in which scam artists in the Virgin Islands are tricking people into returning their calls, then charging outrageous rates for making the call.  (Complete versions are below.) "," This is one of those eRumors that was wrong to begin with and has gotten even more confusing as it has circulated.  We’ll try to unravel it. The bottom line is that you don’t need to completely avoid calling area codes 809, 284, or 876, especially if you know who you are calling.  You do need to be suspicious about strange messages you might get that ask you to return a call to the Caribbean. Here are the details: 1.  The original eRumor warned not to ever call area 809 and that if you did, you would be subject to outrageous charges from scam artists in the Virgin Islands.  Area 809 is a legitimate area code in the Caribbean, (which at the moment is the area code for the Dominican Republic), and there has never been any danger from  making a normal call to there.  There have been scam artists, however, that operated out of the Caribbean by leaving messages for people who, when they returned the call, were unknowingly dialing a number that automatically billed them extremely high charges.  That was the reason for the warning.  Folks were charged anywhere from $10 to $100 per minute and were kept on the line as long as possible.  Some of the messages asked for a voice call in return.  Some asked for information to be faxed. 2.  The original eRumor did quote Scambusters (www.scambusters.com), but they warn that the message picked up some wrong facts along the way and they are not the source for all of the information. 3.  Telephone companies have issued warnings to consumers in the United States about how easy it is to be dialing a Caribbean number without realizing that it’s an international call and will cost more than a domestic call.  Normally, an international call from the U.S. is preceded by dialing “011.”   The Caribbean calls are international, but with domestic looking area codes. So what has happened is that the warning about the scam artists was turned into an unnecessary warning to never call area 809 and now the caution about being aware of the Caribbean area codes being international calls has been wrapped up with the story about the scam artists and turned into an unnecessary warning to never call 809, 284, or 876.

"Beware of lipstick with lead-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lipstick/"," The email says that several lipstick brands contain lead and suggests a simple way to tell whether there is lead in your lipstick. "," We’ve spent a considerable amount of time looking into this one and there is nothing to substantiate the claims of this email. The most important thing that can be said is that in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the lead content in food and cosmetics. The lead levels, if there are any, are tiny and not regarded as harmful by the FDA. The history of cosmetics does include products with lead content.   According to the folks at Maybelline, certain ancient Greek women were said to have coated their face, necks, and breasts with a white powder before applying color make up.  They didn’t realize that the lead content of that white powder was toxic. In England, Elizabethan women used white lead face paint along with mercury sulfide for rouge. The attempts at beauty were marked with falling hair, sickness, and even death.

"Hotel key cards being used for identity theft?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/keycards/"," A warning that key cards issued to hotel or motel guests as room keys are being used for identity theft. The story says that Southern California Law Enforcement professionals discovered that some hotel room keys include the guest’s name, credit card information, and other data that could be used for identity theft. "," Hotels and resorts are increasingly issuing credit card-looking “key cards” to guests instead of traditional metal keys for use in opening the doors to guest rooms. That’s increased security for guests since metal keys could be easily duplicated and most of them had the number of the room stamped on them making it easy for a stolen or lost key to be used for entry. The key cards do not have any visible indication of what room they open.  They also have a magnetic strip on the back that can be programmed, for example, with the dates that the guest is going to use the room so that the key cannot be used after that unless it is programmed with fresh information. Do hotel key cards have guests’ personal information on them?  We surveyed several major hotels in California, Nevada, and Florida and the consensus was emphatic:  No hotel key cards have any personal information on them, not even the guest’s name.  There are some hotels, such as the Hard Rock and Portofino Hotels in Orlando, Florida, that have allow key cards to be used for purchases, but there is no identifying information on the key card. The purchases are billed to the room number and added to the guests hotel charges. One fraud detective we talked with said the eRumor may have been prompted by a police case from Southern California where investigators broke up a group of foreign credit card crooks. They had a large number of stolen key cards from a particular hotel.  The police decided to scan them to see what was on them and they found credit card debit card numbers, not hotel room information.  The reason, according to the detective, is that the crooks can use a credit card scanning device to steal credit and debit card information, program it on to a hotel key card and use it just like the original card.  He said that there was a case in Fresno where a member of a foreign credit card fraud gang was an employee at a gas station. He had made a device that would scan customers’ credit and debit card info on to a hotel key card at the same time that the card was being used for a purchase. A few months after the eRumor started circulating in 2003, we began getting inquiries about information said to have come from the Pasadena, California police department about the risk of key cards. The Pasadena police department issued a press release saying that there had been concerns expressed by a detective and his comments got circulated by various individuals before the issue was completely investigated.  The release confirms that Pasadena detectives contacted several large hotels and computer companies using key card technology who confirmed that the key cards are not programmed with personal information and does not have credit card numbers on them.

It’s in the form of an appeal from the American Family Association urging citizens to complain to the FCC and to members of congress. "," An Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision about a particular occurrence of the F-word on a telecast has sparked controversy, but it isn’t accurate to say that the FCC has approved blanket use of the F-word on radio and television. On April 1, 2013 the FCC released a public notice requesting comments regarding their indecency policies. Click for statement. Currently, the FCC has a guideline posted on their website stressing that content is important to whether or not they will pursue a broadcaster for violations.  The guideline said, “It is a violation of federal law to air obscene programming at any time. It is also a violation of federal law to air indecent programming or profane language during certain hours. Congress has given the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the responsibility for administratively enforcing these laws. The FCC may revoke a station license, impose a monetary forfeiture or issue a warning if a station airs obscene, indecent or profane material.” It was during the Golden Globes Awards telecast on January 19, 2003 that Bono of the band U2 told the audience “this is really, really, f___ing brilliant”” The FCC said the comment was also reported as “this is f___ing great.” There were numerous complaints. The FCC issued a ruling that said Bono used the word as an adjective and not to describe sexual or excretory organs or activities, which is the FCC’s key test for broadcast indecency. In it’s ruling, the FCC said that such “fleeting and isolated remarks of this nature do not warrant Commission action.” Still, critics are saying that even the use of the F-word as an adjective has not been that common on broadcasts, primarily because of fear of running afoul of the FCC and they fear this will mark a change. The FCC responds to complaints of viewers and listeners and rulings regarding objectionable words and scenes have been made before, especially about radio programs. An FCC decision is not the only one affecting what is broadcast. There are also local or state laws that are a part of the picture as well as the decisions and standards of broadcast organizations…not to mention the public.

Smart meter on the left next to the old style electric meter A Southern California Edison employee told TruthOrFiction.com that smart meters do have radio transmitters to send encrypted data to the electric company. According to the a Frequently Asked Questions page on the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) smart meters operate typically at a frequency in the 902 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands.  The radio transmitter range is intended to be localized with output power of 1 watt or less.  The radio transmission is brief and not a signal that is sent throughout the day.  Once a smart meter is activated remotely by radio signal it then transmits data to a neighborhood concentrator, which are usually mounted on power poles.  That information is then relayed to the power company.    By these guidelines, a smart meter is not going to tell the power company when someone is using an electric toothbrush or watching television. Homeowners may be able to opt out and request their old meters back.  According to the Southern California Edison website there is an option to opt out of the smart meter program but it costs an additional $10 per month and there is also a one time $75 set up charge.  Those interested in opting out may contact their power companies for details. Are the transmissions from smart meters harmful? Smart meters, according to the ARRL, abide by and are protected by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15, and are enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.  This regulation governs the operation of other radio devices, which are common household and personal items such as wireless networks, blue tooth accessories, automotive alarm and door remote controls,  cordless phones, wireless computer peripherals and portable fm transmitters for personal MP3 players.  The power output of these devices is intended to be low so as not to cause interference with other devices.  Low power transmissions at their designated frequencies are harmless.

Another email claims to have pictures of Michael Jackson that could put him behind bars for a long time. "," Both of these viruses are true, but the information about Michael Jackson is not. They use the interest in Michael Jackson and his trial in California to try to lure you to click the attachment to the email and infect you with what is called a “Trojan horse” virus. It’s one of the tactics virus writers are using to entice you to open an infected attachment…using the names of celebrities. The Michael Jackson viruses have a couple of themes. One of them, which circulated while the jury was deliberating in Michael Jackson’s 2005 molestation trial, says that he attempted suicide at his Neverland Ranch and left a suicide note admitting his crimes. There is a “read more” link and if you click it, you are taken to a website that delivers the Barobt-Gen Trojan horse which allows other computers to have unauthorized access to your computer, usually for the purpose of using your computer as part of a network of computers to, for example, assault a selected website with so many computers trying to access it that it overwhelms it. Another claims to have incriminating pictures of him that will send him to jail. The email subject is “Michael Jackson Home Movie Horror.” The message body says “Posted here are the pictures that are going to put Michael Jackson behind bars for a very long time. Disturbing stills taken from the home movies shot by Mr. Jackson are now circulating the Net. In these pictures here, it can be clearly seen that Mr. Jackson is performing un-natural acts with the boy in question.” Other viruses have come with promises to show nude pictures of Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Kournikova, and Pamela Anderson, or have announced that Osama Bin Laden has been captured.

Less than two hours after take off all contact with the plane.   Two passengers who were listed as being on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight turned up elsewhere and reported that their passports had been stolen. Responders in the air and on the sea have found an oil slick and some debris but these have not been connected with Flight MH370.   The plane is still missing and  conspiracy theories of a terrorist attack are flying on the World Wide Net. "," TruthOrFiction.Com is following this story and all allegations of foul play, terrorism or alien abduction.  We will post findings here as they develop.  So far, this remains a mystery. Update 03/24/14: Prime Minister Najib Razak said that Malaysia MH370 flight ended in Indian Ocean. The government in Malaysia said today that they have concluded that, “based on satellite data analysis from British company Inmarsat, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ended in the Indian Ocean, and no one on board survived.”  This according to a March 24, 2014 article by the U.K.’s Telegraph that said Prime Minister Najib Razak said that “Inmarsat engineers have been able to establish that the plane’s last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.”   Razak added, “This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.” Update 03/16/14: Investigators now believe that H370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan. According to a March 16, 2014 article by the Daily Mail in England, investigators now believe that the missing MH370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan.  The article said, “A Malaysian government official said people with significant flying experience could have turned off the flight’s communication devices. The representative said that hijacking theory was now ‘conclusive’, and, as a result, police have raided the luxury homes of both the captain and the co-pilot.” The pilot and co-pilot of the the 777 Zahari Ahmad Shah (photo left) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (photo right) “are now being investigated as police in Kuala Lumpur search for signs of foul play.” Background Loss of contact and sudden course change Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off on March 8 at 12:21AM (local time) from Kuala Lumpur and was expected to land in Beijing approximately 6:30AM.  The jet had reached an altitude of 35,000 feet when contact was lost with the plane at approximately 2:40AM. According to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today , the Malaysian military radar indicated that Flight 370 made a sharp turn and “flew at least as far as the Malacca Strait west of Malaysia.”    The article said, “Malaysian authorities have said the plane’s electronic signaling transponder apparently stopped working at about the time civilian flight controllers lost contact with it, near the coast of Vietnam.”  Malaysian Air Force Air Force chief General Rodzali Daud told reporters that military radar data showed  “the track of the plane then turning sharply and eventually flying over the island of Pulau Perak — hundreds of miles off course.” Responders in the air and on the sea are busy conducting search and rescue for the missing airliner but so far any debris or oil slicks found on the water have been determined not to be connected with the missing airliner.  This according to a March 9, 2014 article by USA Today. The Chinese Satellite Image Search planes were dispatched Thursday to conduct a search of an area where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  After a series of search patterns, spotters were unable to find anything.  This according to a March 13, 2014 article by CBS News. U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Flew On for Hours On March 13. 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that “Aviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. 777’s engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program.”    The article said that “investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted “with the intention of using it later for another purpose.” Course change On March 14, 2014 Reuters exclusively reported that “Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators.”    The article said that there are indications that the missing 777 was “either being flown by the pilots or someone with knowledge of those waypoints.” U.S. Military Believes 777 May have Crashed in Indian Ocean A March 13, 2014 news update by England’s Daily Mail reported that the “U.S. military say they believe missing Malaysian jet has crashed in the Indian Ocean and send navy vessel to the area.”   The article said, “U.S. destroyer USS Kidd is now reportedly being moved in to search the area, while Malaysia was due to ask for radar data from India and other neighbouring countries to see if they can trace the plane flying north west.” Stolen Passports used to board missing airliner According to a timeline in a March 10,2014 article by Britain’s Telegraph, Malaysian authorities are investigating the “identities of at least two other passengers in addition to two who were found to be using stolen passports.” Luigi Maraldi, shown on the left, whose name appeared on the passenger list, reported that his passport had been stolen.   Investigating the incident are the Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister along with their counterparts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Telegraph said, “Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is ‘examining additional suspect passports.'” In a later report , the Telegraph reported that “two men travelling on stolen passports on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that mysteriously disappeared on Saturday have been identified as Iranian nationals.”  The article said that the two Iranians “were travelling on passports belonging to Christian Kozel, an 30-year-old Austrian, and Luigi Maraldi, a 37-year-old Italian.” Two Iranian Nationals boarded the plane Security camera photos of the Iranian passengers using stolen passports were released on March 11.1. According to a March 11, 2014 article by Fox News , images “showed the two Iranian men boarding a plane at the same time. Interpol secretary general Ronald K. Noble said Tuesday the two men traveled to Malaysia on their Iranian passports, then apparently switched to the stolen Austrian and Italian documents.”   Noble added, that “recent information about the men made terrorism a less likely cause of the plane’s disappearance, but that did not allay concerns about the ease of travel involving stolen passports.” Cell phones of missing passengers still ringing A few family members of passengers of  the missing MH370 airliner said that  “dialing the numbers resulted in ringing tones on the other end, even though the calls weren’t picked up.”  This according to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today.    The families have encouraged the airline to search for the global positioning satellite (GPS) location of their loved ones’ mobile phones.  Experts in the cellular phone industry said  that a ringing phone is necessarily an indication that the calls went through.  Industry analyst Jeff Kagan told reporters, that the ringing is “just telling you that the network is in the process of finding and connecting to it.” Black hole theory shot down On March 19, 2014 CNN “anchor Don Lemon read a pair of tweets he received from viewers suggesting the plane’s disappearance could be the result of a “black hole,” Bermuda Triangle or an occurrence akin to the television series ‘Lost.'”  Lemon then pursued the possibility of a black hole encounter Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general, and said, “I know it’s preposterous, but is it preposterous, do you think, Mary?”  Schiavo agreed that it was preposterous and added,”a small black hole would suck in our entire universe. So we know it’s not that. The Bermuda Triangle is often weather, and ‘Lost’ is a TV show.” Click image to see video The example of the eRumor was an article posted on the FastCompany.Com website and was linked on the Drudge Report on March 10, 2014.

"Hole Under Lock Car Break-ins-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hole-break-in/"," A viral email recounts how burglars used a hole-punch and a hammer to break into the unidentified author’s car by making a small hole under the door handle. "," It’s become fairly common for burglars to break into cars using a hole-punch to make a hole under the door lock. One of the first reports surfaced in 1999 when former Santa Fe Mayor Larry Delgado’s car was broken into using a hole-punch. The Albuquerque Journal reports that a purse belonging to Delgado’s wife was stolen from the car. Another high-profile case involved R&B star Usher in January 2010. Access Atlanta reports that the singer lost more than $1 million in jewelry, clothes and electronics after burglars punched a hole near his SUV’s door handle. The Adams County Sheriff’s Office even issued a warning to residents that hole-punch car break-ins were on the rise near Natchez, Mississippi, in January 2013. “The latest M.O. is to punch out the door locks just below the key pad with tools — a hole-punch used by metal workers and a hammer — usually on the passenger side of the car so that you don’t notice it immediately,” Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said. “Also, to delay discovery, they are not taking the whole purse or wallet — just cash or credit cards, maybe a gun that you keep under the seat or valuables in the glove box. So again, you don’t notice right away and they have plenty of time to flee the scene.” Sheriff Mayfield’s account mirrors the accusations outlined in the eRumor: the passenger side door was broken into and select items were stolen to conceal the crime.

"," We’ve not found anything to substantiate the Susan McKinley story or the photograph of the alleged larvae in a female breast. There is no alarm being spread by doctors about getting worms from new and unwashed bras.  The picture accompanying the eRumor is a fabrication.  It combines a picture of a woman’s breast with a picture of what has been identified as flower seeds.  A flower expert suggested to TruthOrFiction.com that it was the pod of a water lotus. The video that comes with some versions of the eRumor, however, is real but has nothing to do with either the story told in the eRumor or the photograph. The eRumor circulated for more than two years before the video started appearing attached to it.  The video shows a close-up of a medical worker using tweezers to remove worms from a woman’s breast. It is from a case reported from Africa in which Nigerian woman has what is called “cutaneous myiasis” of the breast due to an infestation by the larva of the Tumbu fly.  The medical report says it is the only reported instance of the infestation so there is no need for spreading an alarm.  It is interesting, if not coincidental, to note that the woman who had the infestation was described as spreading her washed clothes outside for drying and not ironing them before wearing them.  The eRumor makes reference to that as well and it brings up the question of whether the warning was initiated by someone who knew of the lone case. Some more recent versions of the story also include pictures of a couple of white worms that it says are the type that are infesting the breast.  As is clear on the picture, however, it was taken by Michael Bohne of the U.S. Forestry service and is of the larva of the Asian longhorned beetle.  It has nothing to do with any of the other stories.

This manual was found by reference number “FM 3-39.40” on an official military publications site .  That site requires a DOD approval certificate log, which we do not have at the time of this writing to authenticate the “leaked” copy with the official manual. Another unofficial copy of the manual was found posted on the Internet where anyone can download and read. Click to download manual. It is possible that the narrator is spinning a conspiracy theory that the government is out to get us from his interpretation of this manual.  The video’s allegations could be a misinterpretation of what is written in the manual because branches of the DOD are part of the logistical team that are used throughout the world when natural disasters strike. The preface of the manual states that the military police operations could be called in to assist in disaster relief efforts both nationally and abroad: Military police conduct I/R operations during offensive, defensive, stability, or civil support operations. I/R operations include military police support to U.S. military prisoner and detainee operations within operational environments (OEs), ranging from major combat operations to humanitarian-assistance missions in support of a host nation (HN) or civil agency. On page 14  the manual there is a flow chart that shows that “Displaced Civilians” (DC) come under resettlement operations and not classified as “Detainees.”   Yet, there is a classification for “Civilian Internees” (CI) who fall under the Detainee category.  In this context. an enemy combatant affiliated with a terrorist cell would come under the category of CI where the victim of a flood or earthquake whose home or city was destroyed could come under DC.  Under the heading of DC are included refugees, migrants, expellees, internally displaced persons, evacuees and stateless persons. Flow chart found on page 14 of the manual Civilian Internee (CI) is defined in the manual on page 17: 1-10. A CI is a civilian who is interned during armed conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power. (JP 3-63) CIs, unless they have committed acts for which they are considered unlawful combatants, generally qualify for protected status according to the GC, which also establishes procedures that must be observed when depriving such civilians of their liberty. CIs are to be accommodated separately from EPWs and persons deprived of liberty for any other reason. Displaced Civilian is not defined but the manual does describe how they should be treated on page 33: DISPLACED CIVILIAN HANDLING 2-10. Military police units may be required to support the collection and control of DCs. In offensive, defensive, and stability operations many of the fundamentals are similar to that of handling detainees, but the focus is typically different.

"Deadly Snow Snakes in Ohio and Pennsylvania-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/deadly-snow-snake/"," This is a forwarded email and posting on Facebook and other social media alleging that a deadly snow snake comes out in the cold and bites people.  The venom from this dangerous serpent is said to cause the victim’s blood to freeze. "," This eRumor is a hoax.  There is no such thing as a snow snake, snake venom is incapable of freezing blood and snakes do not come out in the winter. Snakes are cold blooded reptiles that rely on the elements and their habitat to regulated their body temperature.  According to information found on the website of the LLL Reptile and Supply Company , when the temperatures drop in the winter, snakes go into a state of  brumation, which is similar to hibernation among certain mammals in the wild.  During brumation the snake becomes “lethargic, sometimes not moving at all for the duration of the cold season.”   The brumation period usually lasts until Spring. The TruthOrFiction.Com Team believe that the snake in the photo is a toy snake made of rubber.   We found rubber snakes similar to the one in the eRumor posted on the website of the Akron Novelty Company Screen shot from the Akron Novelty Company Website As for the snake venom that freezes blood, this is also a hoax. There are two basic categories of venoms from retiles, neurotoxins  and hemotoxins.   Neurotoxins, common in cobras, mamba and coral snakes attack the nervous system and paralyzes the respiratory center.   Hemotoxins are found in the venom of vipers like rattlesnake, copperheads and water moccasins.  The word “hemotoxin” means blood toxin, which causes death of tissue and prevents the blood from clotting –  necrosis and anticoagulation. The effects of a hemotoxin venom would be incapable of freezing blood.   This according to information posted on the website of the University of Bristol – School of Chemistry .   The School of Chemistry also said that one species, the Mojave Rattle Snake is one of the few snakes that has both types of toxins in its venom.

"Cancer can be caused by foods in plastics and that’s how Sheryl Crow gotcancer-Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dioxins/"," There are a several versions of this eRumor. The first to appear on the Internet was a message that says a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from the Castle Hospital (no location mentioned) appeared on television and said plastic containers should not be used for heating foods in a microwave oven. He said this is especially true if the foods contain fat. The message claims that the combination of fats and plastics will release dioxins into the food and into the cells of the body with a risk of cancer. The doctor recommended using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers instead in order to avoid the dioxin. Prepared foods such as TV dinners should be taken out of plastic containers before heating. The second version tells the story of a seventh-grade student who decided to do some experiments with microwave radiation on food wrapped in plastic. She is said to have enlisted the help of the National Center for “Toxicological”  Research in Arkansas.  The student allegedly found that not only are there carcinogens migrating from the plastic into food during microwaving, but other substances as well. This eRumor also lists an article about Dr. Edward Fujimoto saying that he appeared on a TV station in Huntsville, Alabama. Another version claims all this was in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center. Yet another version says that singer Sheryl Crow, who is suffering from breast cancer, got her cancer from drinking from plastic water bottles left in the sun and that got too hot and, as a result, were contaminated with dioxins. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find any research that supports the fear that food can become contaminated with dioxins either from plastic wrap or plastic in microwave ovens. It’s an understandable concern because dioxins are among the most poisonous chemical group known and steps have been taken by many world governments to reduce the amounts of dioxins in the environment. Dr. Edward Fujimoto is real and is the Manager of the Wellness and Lifestyle Medicine Department at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii. (not Alabama).  Part of this eRumor is the result of an interview he did on KHON-TV channel 2 in Hawaii on January 23, 2002. TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Fujimoto who said the eRumor quoted him fairly accurately.  His concern was whether a combination of ingredients, especially plastics and food fats, could result in food being contaminated by dioxins when heated in a microwave. That is his observation and he claims to have research substantiating it. TruthOrFiction.com has twice asked for him to give us that research but has never received it.  He said that he is surprised about how little Americans know about dioxins in everyday life because in Japan, the majority of the population knows about them and the country has enacted regulations to protect its people.  He explained that in his view, heating food in a plastic container will produce the release of dioxins and fat will absorb them. The amount of migration of dioxins to fat, he said, will be a function of the heat in the microwave, the type of plastic, the length of time of exposure, and the amount of fat that is in contact.  Dr. Fujimoto pointed out that the amounts of dioxins in any given piece of plastic or food that is microwaved in plastic is very small, but that the problem is that dioxins get into the human body and accumulate. He sad that in Japan, there has been a complete change in the way foods are packaged so that plastic is avoided. They use more glass, for example. In early 2004, a corrupted version of the eRumor started circulating that made it appear as though Dr. Fujimoto was also concerned about putting water in plastic bottles and freezing it, but he never addressed that.  This version of the eRumor also made it sound as though the plastic itself was the problem, not the plastic in combination with food and heat.  It says, for example, that the heat causes dioxin (sic) to “drip from the plastic” into the food but none of the researchers has claimed that. A variation of the bottled water version said that was how singer Sheryl Crow got cancer, by drinking bottled water and that she appeared on the Ellen show or the Oprah show to tell the story. Crow has been treated for breast cancer but she’s never blamed it on bottled water. Another version of eRumor about the seventh-grader has been a little more difficult to detail.  We’ve confirmed that there is a Dr. Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxilogical Research who, along with a Claire V. Nelson, published a paper at a professional event in Orlando, Florida in 1998 and it was on the subject of food contamination from plastic wrap.   We’ve not found the actual study, however, and have never received a response from Dr. Wilkes. The eRumor about Jon Wilkes and Claire Nelson appears to have come from the Options Newsletter published by People Against Cancer at www.peopleagainstcancer.com . The folks who make Saran Wrap have responded to the eRumor.  A statement by the SC Johnson company says the “plasticizer” in Saran Wrap is derivative of naturally occurring citric acid found in citrus fruits and is 100% dioxin free.  The statement further adds that dioxins can only be formed with chlorine is combined with the kinds of high temperatures associated with waste incinerators, temperatures like 1,500 degrees F. Even the most powerful microwaves are not capable of those temperatures, according to the company. SC Johnson says none of its products contains dioxins. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dioxins are both natural and man-made.  The man-made dioxins are released into the air from sources like waste incineration, from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil), and certain types of chemical processing.  Almost every person has been exposed to low levels of dioxins and the EPA says there is research that suggests that high levels of dioxins may be correlated with various health problems, although some of that is extrapolated from studies of animals, not humans. The only reference we could find about dioxins and microwaves was from an FDA publication that was concerned about dioxins resulting from the bleached manufacture of paper goods including milk cartons and some paper containers for microwave dinners.  That was not about plastics and high temperatures, however, and the levels of dioxins were described as safe. The Food and Safety Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has published guidelines for safe cooking in microwave ovens and warns against using materials that are not regarded as microwave safe. CLICK HERE for those guidelines.  You’ll note that one of the guidelines is to avoid letting plastic wraps touch food.  That is another issue, however, and not related to dioxins or high heat in microwaves. The Food and Drug Administration has also issued a statement about plastics and microwaves.v CLICK HERE for that document. The American Plastics Council has also posted a page on the subject. CLICK HERE for their take on the dioxin question. Somewhere along the way someone decided to add that all this information had appeared in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center but neither has promoted the dioxin story. Even though Johns Hopkins has not been the source of the eRumor, there have been enough emails that falsely attributed the story to them that the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health asked Dr. Rolf Halden, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Services at the school’s Center for Water and Health to address the concerns over dioxins. He said that the principal sources of dioxins are from various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and volcanic eruptions.  Plastics do not actually contain dioxins, he said, but wastes that contain certain compounds can serve as dioxin precursors when incinerated. According to Halden, most people are exposed to dioxins when eating meat and fish rich in fat because dioxins that have been sent into the atmosphere become attached to particles that fall back to the earth and get concentrated and store in the fat of fish and other animals. Halden said that the alleged danger or freezing water in plastic bottles is unfounded and an urban legend.  First, because there are no dioxins in plastics.  Second because freezing actually inhibits the release of chemicals.  He said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water in the bottles, not the bottles themselves.  He added that there is another group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle that could disrupt endocrine functions in humans and animals and that heating up the plastics could increase their being released into water and food. Regarding cooking with plastics, Halden said that whenever you heat something it increases the likelihood that chemicals could be pulled out.  he recommends using heat-resistant glass or ceramics for microwave cooking, just to be safe.

"Injuries on children caused by cleaning “erasers”-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cleaningproducts/"," There are apparently different versions of this but they all warn that children can experience injuries on the skin from the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser or the Mr Clean Magic Eraser. One of the eRumors says that Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is being removed from store shelves because of containing formaldehyde. "," The bottom line is that there is a first-hand story of a child who experienced skin irritation from a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser but there is dispute about whether it was from chemicals or the abrasive action of the product from being rubbed on the skin. The story about Mr. Clean Magic Eraser being removed from the market is not true. Procter & Gamble Mr Clean Magic Eraser The eRumor claims that the Magic Eraser contains formaldehyde. If you review the government-required Material Safety Data Sheet, you see that one of the ingredients is “Formaldehyde-Melamine-Sodium Bisulfite Copolymer.”  That’s the name of the entire ingredient and it’s different than if the product had formaldehyde alone, according to Procter & Gamble. A company release said that “…the word ‘formaldehyde’ is in its chemical name. However, this ingredient is not formaldehyde and poses no health or safety risks. (Think of this name like ‘sodium chloride’, which is table salt. Sodium by itself can be dangerous, but sodium chloride – salt – is safe.).”  The company said that any formaldehyde found on its product would be in tiny amounts and a result of the manufacturing process and would be “actually less than what is found in indoor air.” Procter & Gamble denies that there is any danger from the product and adds “In fact, no ingredients in Magic Eraser are subject to any health-related labeling laws in North America or in the European Union.” ScotchBrite Easy Eraser The text of the eRumor about a mother’s experience with the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser is authentic.  It’s a first-hand account from the woman who runs a website named Kerflop .  Don’t know if that’s her last name but her first name is Jessica and the text of the eRumor is posted on her site.  The incident took place in 2006. She describes how her son (picture below) got “large, shiny, blistering red marks… across his cheeks and chin” from apparently rubbing a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser on his face.  She got advice over the phone from a poison center, which told her that products like the Easy Eraser and Magic Eraser “…have a pH of 8 – 10 and can cause chemical burns.”  They gave her first-aid instructions.  She then took her son to a hospital for treatment.  It is her contention that the product contained “a harmful alkaline or “base” chemical (opposite of acid on the pH scale) that can burn your skin.”  She describes his injuries as “chemical burns.” We have not found any experts who would agree with the comment from the poison control center that a pH of 8 – 10 can cause chemical burns.”  The pH scale measures the range of acidity on one hand and alkalinity on the other.  The scale ranges from 0 to 14. At the 0 end is solutions that are very acidic.  Lemon juice is about a 2, vinegar is around 3,. Pure water has a neutral pH of 7, which is and some soaps range up to a pH of 9. Although her story is about ScotchBrite’s Easy Eraser, she makes reference to the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser as well and notes that the original packaging of each did not include any warnings of harm from their use on the skin. The 3M company’s Material Safety Data Sheet shows that the product is made of polyurethane foam and melamine foam.  No other chemicals are listed. The sheet does indicate that there can be “mechanical abrasion” and Kerflop says that in January she got a note from 3M that said: “We have addressed the issue and are taking steps to change the packaging to warn other consumers of the potential reaction to using the product on the skin.” Updated 7/25/07 ","Warnings"

Summary eRumor: This is the   first-hand account of a woman who says she was eventually diagnosed   with ovarian cancer, but laments that she wasn’t given a   “CA-125” medical test earlier than when she got it.    She urges women to get the test annually and equates it with a   common screening test in men for prostate cancer. "," Anyone who has had treatment for ovarian cancer knows what an important role the CA-125 test can play, but TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed numerous professional documents regarding the CA-125 test and has not found a single one that recommends it alone as the primary screening tool for ovarian cancer. CA-125 is a substance found in the blood of some women with ovarian cancer.  According to the American Cancer Society, however, a CA-125 test is not a reliable tool for finding ovarian cancer because of its poor accuracy.   There is a large number of false negatives because some ovarian cancers do not raise CA-125 levels and some false positives because other conditions can sometimes raise CA-125 levels. Partly in response to the email eRumor, a statement was issued by a medical panel at a conference of the National Institutes of Health in April of 1994 that said the CA-125 test “…alone is not an adequate screening test.” The Louis Busch Hagar Cancer Center of Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown, New York, says that more than 50 percent of the women with ovarian cancer will not show results on a CA-125 test and a statement by the center calls the test a “disappointment.” It is regarded as a valuable tool, however, when sometimes combined with other tests or in targeted groups of women, such as those who have already gone through menopause.   Also, a study in the February 16, 1999 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine and cited by the American Cancer Society found that the CA-125 test was a valuable in tracking the progress of one of the most common forms of ovarian cancer, but that was after the cancer had already been found and was being treated.  The same article says the CA-125 test does not meet the standards of a screening test. According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer and fifth most common cause of cancer death among women and accounts for four percent of all cancers in women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. There is no question that early detection should be every woman’s goal and that she should work with her physician to that end .

"Girl Scout Cookies Fund Planned Parenthood-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/afa-gsusa-cookies/"," Pro-life activists say Girl Scout cookie sales benefit Planned Parenthood and have called for a boycott. "," Girl Scout cookies don’t fund Planned Parenthood. Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn’t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the “Today” show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange , Clogninger defended the council’s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that’s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls. …It’s really impossible for girls to grow up in today’s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn’t acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there’s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter “does not take a position to develop materials” or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video : We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it’s an investment in a little girl… Given Clonginger’s earlier remarks, Chavez’s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local “relationships” between councils and Planned Parenthood while Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There’s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn’t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get licensing royalties from bakers of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl’s Girl Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

"The Petroleum Equipment Institute report on gasoline fires started by sparks-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sparks/"," A message said to have       resulted from a conversation with Robert Renkes of The Petroleum       Equipment Institute (PEI) who says there have been more than 150       cases of fires caused by sparks from static electricity igniting gasoline vapors.         The eRumor says it has happened mostly to women, mostly with Dodge        Caravans, and mostly among people who have re-entered their cars        during refueling. The email encourages caution when drivers are filling their tanks        at gas       stations. "," Robert Renkes, the Petroleum Equipment Institute, and a report on fires started by static electricity are real.  The institute is sponsoring a project called “Stop Static.” Static electricity is the build-up of an electrical charge, such as around a person,  that can be discharged when coming into contact with the ground or anything connected to the ground, such as a light switch, an elevator door, or even another person.  When that happens, people feel a “shock” as the electricity discharges.  To minimize the danger of static sparks igniting gas vapors,  the pump nozzles at gas stations have a wire that “grounds” the nozzles to the equipment.  The Petroleum Equipment Institute says there are many fires that have been started by flame, cigarettes, or electrical sparks, but until recently, there had not been much documentation about fires started by sparks from static electricity.  Further, the fires happened where there was no open flame, no cigarette, and the pump nozzle was properly grounded. In a report on their website (www.pei.org), the institute says it has collected data regarding more than 150 fires that they believe have been started by static sparking.  They recommend more research, but their conclusion is that most of the fires resulted from a motorist scooting in and out of the car during the refueling, which caused a build-up of static electricity.  Then when the motorist touched the pump handle or the area around the gas cap, the spark discharge and ignited the gas vapors. The “Stop Static” campaign recommends three rules for making refueling a vehicle safer:  1.  Turn off the engine.  2.  Extinguish any cigarette.  3.  Don’t get in and out of the car during the refueling. Some of the other findings in the PEI report include that all of the fires took place on days of dry weather, usually also cold weather, and that the drivers mostly wore shoes with rubber soles.  One of the versions of this eRumor says the incidents happened mostly to women, but there is no information in the report about that. The PEI report did not blame any of the fires on cell phones.  Although some gas companies and cell phone manufacturers say cell phones should not be used at gas stations, there have been no gasoline fires or explosions that anybody knows of caused by radio transmissions from cell phones.

"The Mondex chip for the right hand and forehead-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mondex/"," This eRumor comes in various forms including a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. It describes new technology that can use tiny electronic chips to identify the person who has the chip and that it could be part of a future cashless society in which the chip would be used for financial exchanges instead of money. The eRumor also claims that the chip can be implanted into people’s bodies and that the two best places for it ware the right hand or the head.  The story hearkens to a Biblical passage in the book of Revelation that describes “The Mark of the Beast,” a system in which buying and selling can take place only with the approval of a world ruler who requires his mark to be on the right hand or forehead of every living person. "," This issue is the result of concern over small electronic chips being used in the marketplace that store bits of information on them that can be identified by using a special device that can detect and read them. An example is the “Speedpass” device that is used by Exxon and Mobil, among others, as a convenient way to make purchases.  The Speedpass is a small cylinder you can put on your key chain. When you buy gas, just wave the Speedpass in front of the pump and the gas will be automatically charged to your account.  Other retailers have experimented with Speedpass as a way of taking payment. These gizmos are known as RFID (radio frequency identification devices).  They are very small, can store information, and don’t need batteries.  When one of them comes within range of another device that can read their information, the radio transmission of the reader energizes the RFID chip so that the exchange of information can take place.  Because the chips are small and relatively inexpensive, some companies have begun using them for inventory control and as a substitute for bar codes. There is some controversy over that and demands that if the chips are used on retail items, such as clothing, that they be deactivated when sold.  The typical distance between the chips and their readers is a few inches. The PowerPoint presentation presents everything as being under the umbrella of “Mondex,” which is actually just a part of the picture, and the story focuses on so called “smart cards,” a credit card looking card that has actual cash amounts programmed into it. There is interest on the part of companies like MasterCard to see the smart card become popular but so far it is not clear how successful that is going to be. The device being described in the PowerPoint presentation that is circulating on the Internet  is the VeriChip from Applied Digital Technology which promoted it as “miniaturized, implantable, identification technology.”  It is a microchip encased in glass and is very tiny…about the size of the grain of rice.  When in the presence of a VeriChip reader, the information on the VeriChip can be retrieved.  One of the major purposes of the VeriChip would be to provide hospitals and medical teams any important information about yourself in an emergency.  The chip could tell them about your medical condition, any wishes you have regarding medical treatment, and other identifying information in case you are unconscious.  Another application is to identify children in case of kidnapping. The eRumor claims that a lot of money was spent to determine that the two best places for placement of the chip on the body are the right hand and the head.  All the VeriChip literature states, however, that the chip is to be placed in a fleshy area such as behind the upper arm.  We’ve not found any evidence that research suggested the right hand or the head. The eRumor claims that chips implanted into humans would be permanent and that there would be no way to get them out since any surgery designed to remove them would cause them to explode and contaminate their host.  One report claims that the attempted removal of the chip and the resulting explosion would cause radiation to enter the host’s body because of the chip’s lithium battery being destroyed. We have not been able to find any substantiation of that.  The VeriChip, for example, does not have a battery and is predicted to last for about 20 years after which it could easily be replaced. While the thought of having implanted chips seems to provide a lot of good things such as information for medical emergencies, tracking missing persons, and making purchases simpler, there are a lot of concerns to be overcome.  One is security.  How secure would your chip be from people you don’t want reading it? Plus, the conspiracy theorists do have a point:  Systems that have been enacted by governments for one purpose could be used for other, less honorable purposes. Does all of this have Biblical significance.  It could if governments decided to adopt the technology and make it mandatory.  At present, it’s commercial and voluntary.  But it’s always good to be reminded that a “Mark of the Beast” type system isn’t dependent on technology and could be implemented using something as simple as tattoos.

The information contained in the e-mail is FALSE and the RCMP regrets any unnecessary alarm this may have caused the public.” There have been seasons when this eRumor has become so widely circulated that even police departments and government agencies have posted it without realizing it is not true or have had so many citizen reports of the hoax that they’ve braced themselves for dealing with the rumor itself.  According to an article in the Houston Chronicle in September of 2003, officers in Houston and Harris county were on alert one weekend because of warnings of the gang/headlight initiation.  In 1993 police in Wichita, Kansas, thought they had a shooting that may have been prompted by the the rumor. A woman was shot at after flashing her lights at a pickup that was driving without lights.  No one was injured and there was no indication that it was gang activity.  There have been other incidents of road rage that might loosely fit what is described in the eRumor, we have never found any documentation of this being a gang ritual or a valid warning from a law enforcement agency.

"Mapping telephone numbers on Google-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/google/"," This is a warning that the search engine at www.google.com has a feature that will map the location of a telephone number.  It suggests having Google remove your number so anyone with harmful motives will not be able to use the feature against you. "," This is one of those eRumors that focuses on a non-sinister feature of the Internet and makes it sound sinister.  We have not been able to find any evidence that any law enforcement agency has issued any warnings about the Google search for phone numbers. Google.com is one of the most versatile search engines on the Internet.  One of the features built into Google is the ability to conveniently look up information from the White Pages of any telephone book.  If you type a name, address, and city of a person with a listed phone number, you will probably get that person’s White Pages listing which includes the telephone number.  As an added feature, Google includes a couple of mapping services in case you want to look up the location.  In the same way, you can enter the telephone number alone and if it is a listed number, you’ll get the complete listing including the address and, if desired, the mapping to that address. The problem with the eRumor is that it makes it sound as though this is priviledged information, which it is not.  It’s the same information that could be gotten from a phone book or directory assistance.  It also makes it sound as though the feature is specifically for the purpose of entering a phone number and finding a map.  It is not.  The feature finds all the listed information about phone number and includes the mapping if you choose it. If, for some reason, you do not wish for your information to be available through Google, you can, as the eRumor describes, click the telephone icon next to your information and they will remove you from their database, but that means very little.  The reason the information is there is because it’s public and removing it from Google doesn’t prevent anyone from having it.  They can go to the telephone book, directory assistance, or any of the other pages on the Internet that have name, address, and telephone information.  If you don’t want the information to be public, contact your telephone provider and ask about an unlisted number or a number that does not list your address.

She is said to have responded by saying “Yes, I believe in Jesus” or simply “yes,” but there has been controversy over whether it was she or another student who said those words. Cassie became well known as a result and many Christian luminaries participated in her funeral service. Out of that came the phrase, “It takes guts to say Jesus.” ","Warnings"

"," The warning is true.  What appears to be an invitation to read an e-card actually forwards your Outlook addresses to a Spammer who will be sending advertisements to your friends about pornography. The email arrives with a cartoon-like graphic that says “You have received an e-card.  Click here to open.”  It says it’s from friendlygreetings.com, friendgreetings.com, or laugh-mail.com.  In smaller print you are told that an e-card viewer plug-in may be required to view some cards.  When you click on the link to view your card, you are asked to run an installer.  You are also asked to read and approve some fine-print but since most of us don’t take the time to read that stuff, you don’t realize that that you have just approved a user agreement that authorizes all of the addresses in your Microsoft Outlook address book to be sent to the originator of the message.  According to Bob Sullivan of MSNBC, this is a scheme to collect email addresses for a Spammer and one who sends porn Spam.  CNN says this particular site, which has since been taken down, was operated by a Canadian company called Cytron Communications. It’s not technically a virus since it doesn’t “infect” your computer or damage it and you have given permission for the email addresses to be collected.  It is misleading and sleazy and doesn’t disclose that the email addresses will be used for Spam. Most legitimate e-card companies do not ask you to download a file.  They merely refer you to a safe website where your greeting card can be viewed online. Virus experts are warning that there are other companies now trying this tactic.  They suggest avoiding installing programs from emails and that if there is fine-print, read it.  Also, Lawrence Baldwin, president of Internet security firm myNetWatchman.com told CNN that he suggests  disabling the Internet Explorer function that allows browsers to instantly download ActiveX Controls. Doing so will cause a warning box to appear anytime such files are encountered, which could get annoying because Macromedia Flash, used to create Web animations, uses ActiveX Controls. Although at least one virus protection program will alert you to the danger of the friendlygreetings.com email, not all of the virus protection companies are classifying it as a virus and are not detecting it.

The man who repaired it pulled out what appeared to be a clean lint filter but when taken over to the kitchen sink would not allow water to run through it. It was clogged. The repairman said it was the result of using dryer sheets, that they result in a film that clogs the filter and that can only be removed by scrubbing the filter with a brush as well as soap. "," There appears to be some truth to this one, although not all dryer sheets are the same. We did some checking and found several manufacturers of clothes dryers who discouraged using dryer sheets. The owners manuals for  Eurotech brand tumble dryers say “We recommend using a liquid fabric softener in the washer’s rinse cycle.  We do not recommend using fabric softener sheets in the dryer. Over time, the chemicals on these sheets can build up inside the lint filter and clog the holes that circulate the air.” The Asko Corporation, which makes washers and dryers, publishes a “Dryer Use and Car Guide.” They have the same recommendation against using fabric softener sheets in dryers because of chemical build-up that can clog the filter. Frigidaire in its FAQ about dryers says that not only should the lint screen be cleaned after every load but occasionally washed in soap and water to remove built-up residue from dryer sheets. Dave Harnish of Dave’s Repair Service in New Albany, PA, publishes a newsletter about appliances titled DRSNews. In his 10/18/03 edition, he said “If you use dryer fabric softener sheets, be careful to use only one sheet per load (or two). The chemical used in these sheets can clog lint filters…” He recommends washing them with hot water and soap, scrubbing with a brush. Most of the articles we found said the build-up on the lint filters is because of chemicals used in the dryer sheets. There are some products that claim to reduce static, soften fabric, and do not use chemicals, but we’ve not seen an independent evaluation of those. Doing a search at www.google.com for: dryer sheets “chemical free” will list some of those. . Last updated 2/24/05 ","Warnings"

"Boycott gas stations to protest rising fuel prices?-Grass Roots Effort& Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fuelprotest/"," The email says that it’s been calculated that if everyone in the United States would avoid buying gasoline for just one day, the oil companies would “choke” on their stockpiles.  It encourages a boycott of oil companies to protest high gas prices.  The latest version called for a boycott on May 15, 2007.  Some versions reference similar campaigns that allegedly took place in other years, such as 1997 and 1999 or “last year.” . "," This eRumor in various forms has popped up every few months for several years, especially in the Spring. The email has not been effective, however, and was not in when tried before. There has not ever been a grass-roots effort like this that has ever had an impact on the oil and gas industry or on gas prices. John Ballard, vice president of retail marketing for Holland Oil, which owns 55 Northeast Ohio stations told the Akron Beacon Journal it was kind of an average day after the call for a protest on May 19, 2004.  The Orange County Register in California did a survey of gas stations at the same time and did not find any that noticed a drop in sales.  One station owner said he’d never seen a boycott have any impact.  It was the same in Alabama, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and many other states. The experts say there are several reasons that the boycotts don’t work. F irst, it was a grass-roots effort originated by someone who apparently thought it would be a nifty idea but did not have the muscle to accomplish the goal of a national boycott.  In other words, it wouldn’t have recruited enough people. Second, it was based on a flawed assumption.  The eRumor said, “It has been calculated that if everyone in the United States did not purchase a drop of gasoline for one day…the oil companies would choke on their stockpiles.”  No such calculation was been announced that we can find.  It was apparently the fabrication of whoever originated the email. We’ve talked with representatives of the oil industry who say that a one-day boycott of gas stations would not really accomplish much because those who decided not to buy gas on that day would still presumably need gas within several days.  The sales for a given week or month would probably end up being the same. University of Michigan economics professor Stephen Salant told Detroit Free Press columnist Matt Helms that it was hard to think of anything less effective than the suggested one-day boycott. Also, the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C., said that oil inventories were on the low side for that  time of year in 2004, so there were no stockpiles to choke. Most of the boycott emails focused on trying to influence the Middle East, but the American Petroleum Institute says that two of the largest suppliers of crude oil to the United States are our neighbors Canada and Mexico.

Some Canadian versions of the story say the number to call is #677. "," Whether this particular story is real, we don’t know, but the information it conveys is apparently sound. TruthOrFiction.com talked with law enforcement agencies on both the East and West Coasts. The consensus was that if you are suspicious about a patrol car wanting to pull you over, especially in an isolated area or at night, it’s prudent to proceed to a place where would feel safer. The problem is that the law says you are to obey an officer who says to pull over so if you do decide to continue, do so in a way that makes it clear you are not trying to evade him or her. If you have a cell phone, call your local emergency number, usually 911, and you can be connected to a dispatcher who can help decide whether the car attempting to pull you over is legitimate. Also, as happens in this eRumor, you can inform the dispatcher that it is your intention to comply, but only after you get to the next off ramp, gas station, populated areas, etc. We’ve received numerous emails asking about the #77 procedure described in the eRumor. Even though 911 is the most common   number to use in an emergency, there are many states that have   established other numbers as well for cell phone users, especially   to report highway emergencies. The #77 number is one   of them.  Some states use *77 or even #55. The story that suggests using #677 is a Canadian version of this eRumor that inserted the numbers for reaching the Ontario Provincial Police in Ontario. One of the   reasons, according to a cell company we spoke with, is that the   911 calls from a cell phone go to different kinds of agencies   depending on where the phone call is being made. In some   areas, dialing 911 on a cell phone may go to a city or county   emergency dispatcher.  In other  areas, the call may go   to a state highway law enforcement agency such as the highway   patrol or state troopers. In the states with the   “77” numbers, cell phone users will usually get   connected directly with a highway law enforcement agency. For that reason, you will frequently see signs posted along some   freeways, expressways, or toll ways suggesting use of a number   other than 911 if you’re using a cell phone. ","Warnings"

Also, this eRumor makes reference to getting information from       checks, but that is not as significant a problem as getting       information from credit cards. We all need to protect our credit card data because at the very       least it can be used to make unauthorized purchases and at the very       most it can be used as a part of identity theft. Information from checks, however, is not as much of a threat. Your bank account number is not a private as your credit card       number. It’s on every check to write and the mere knowledge of your bank       account number does not lead to identity theft.

It is a joke and should not be taken seriously. RFID is an acronym for Radio Frequency Identification.  This micro technology have no power source and they must be read by scanners, what what the industry calls “RFID readers.”   Because of this they can not read these chips at any great distances.  They work by absorbing a signal from scanner a few inches away. By adding casing containing antennas and power to the RFID you loose the tiny size but gain how much distance a scanner will work in a particular setting.   An RFID microchip can be injected under the skin of a pet to help find the owner when lost.   In a battery powered casing with an internal antenna you can use this technology to lock or unlock your automobile.    RFIDs in larger cases with internal antennas can be used to at toll booths. RFIDs have unique information.  The tags that retail stores put on merchandise are not RFID because they indicate to the reader whether an item was paid and properly checked out before passing a scanner.

"," This email is a copy of a release from the American Family Association. There are several issues in this eRumor.  We’ll take them one at a time. Chavez has a TV program in Venezuela.  In one of his TV shows he said “Enough of imperialist aggression; we must tell the world: down with the U.S. empire. We have to bury imperialism this century.” It’s not hard to interpret that as a vow against the United States.  Whether he meant that literally or meant that he would like to see a political death to the United States is being debated.  In any case, Venezuela would not win a military confrontation with the United States, but Chavez’s disdain for the U.S. is clear. It is also on one of his TV programs that Chavez welcomed U.S. antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan who has been an outspoken critic of President Bush.  He had singer Harry Belefonte as a guest as well, in January, 2006.  Belefonte has also been a vocal critic of the president. Chavez has been president of Venezuela since 1998.  One of his first acts was to build relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba and his leftist government has been in the watchful eye of the U.S. ever since.  In February, 2006, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the Venezuelan government posed “one of the biggest problems” in Latin America, particularly because of its ties with Cuba.  Chavez responded with a threat to stop the flow of oil to the U.S., a threat he has made before. Citgo is the American subsidiary of the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. He has also threatened to block inbound flights to Venezuela from the U.S.. Boycotts of oil companies have been tried on numerous occasions and, so far, without measurable results.  Citgo is Venezuelan owned but the majority of the people who would be impacted by a successful boycott are mostly Americans.

"The “Triangle of Life” can save your life during an earthquake-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:39:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/triangle-of-life/"," An article from the pen of disaster rescuer Doug Copp.  He lists some of his observations from being on the scene after earthquakes and introduces what he calls “The Triangle of Life,” which he says can save lives during an earthquake.  He rejects the advice of traditional disaster experts and gives suggestions about what to do and where to be during an earthquake. "," Doug Copp claims, as the eRumor states, to lead the “world’s most experienced rescue team” and that he’s crawled into 875 buildings in 60 countries to find trapped victims of disasters. He argues that his experience has led him to conclude that the common suggestions of getting under a desk or standing in a doorway during an earthquake actually lead to more deaths.  Instead he lists several other suggestions such as simply rolling off a bed onto the floor if you are in bed or taking refuge next to a large sofa or chair when the earth starts moving. Copp’s tips are based on some of his own observations but on scientific research and there are disaster experts who disagree with him. The American Red Cross has written a response to Copp’s statements.  Ricky Lopes, manager of the American Red Cross’s Community Disaster Education, said Copp’s recommendations are “Inaccurate for application in the United States and inconsistent with information developed through earthquake research.” In a statement, Lopes said the American Red Cross’s recommendation is called “drop, cover, and hold on,” which includes getting under a heavy object such as a desk.  He said it is based on building codes in the United States and “has saved lives.” CLICK HERE for more from the American Red Cross. Dr. Marla Petal is director of the Bogazici University, Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute’s Disaster Preparedness Education Program in Turkey.  Her doctoral research was on the causes of death in the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake in Turkey, which killed more than 20,000 people.  She called the advice in the Doug Copp eRumor “plainly dangerous” and “worse than an urban legend.”   She said that there are indeed “triangles of life” in collapsed buildings where searchers look first for survivors—but that it is impossible to predict where those spaces will be.  She said, for example, that hiding next to a refrigerator or some other heavy object could be deadly because there is no way to anticipate which direction the object may move during a quake.  You could get crushed.  The same is true with automobiles.  She said that a strong earthquake will move and sometimes topple cars so simply getting out of the car and lying next to it does not create a dependable safety zone. Copp also found himself a center of controversy especially after a series of articles in 2004 by the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico.   Copp has claimed to have played a key role in rescue activities at Ground Zero in New York after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  He was granted more than $600,000 in compensation for what he said are injuries from the event, mostly toxicity.  The articles in the Albuquerque journal questioned both whether he played any important role at Ground Zero and whether he was eligible for any compensation for injury.  In a four-part series about Copp, the Journal quoted several people who saw Copp at Ground Zero as saying that he showed up with a video camera and did no serious rescue work.  The U.S. Justice Department fraud unit was investigating.

"," There is widespread and legitimate concern in Louisiana and other parts of the South about the destructive Formosan subterranean termite, but not because of mulch made from downed trees from New Orleans.  The local governments are not “trying to get rid of tons and tons of this mulch to any state or company who will come and haul it away.”  The Louisiana Department of Agriculture has established a quarantine that prohibits taking any goods or materials damaged by the hurricanes out of the 12-parish area of New Orleans.  That includes all wood waste, such as fallen trees, whether the trees are intact or have been chipped into bits and pieces. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Formosan subterranean termite is one of the most destructive termite species in the world.  It takes only one king and queen to produce an enormous colony.  A mature colony can include millions of termites and can produce 3,000 new termites per day.  The USDA says it is believed that the pests came into the U.S. from Taiwan aboard ships during World War II.  The University of Florida says that the first recorded infestation of Formosan termites was in 1957 in Charleston, South Carolina.  Within a few years colonies were found in Galveston and Houston, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana.  The USDA estimates that in New Orleans alone the Formosan termites infest 30 percent of the trees. The Formosan termites are weak fliers so they do not naturally move long distances.  They spread to other areas primarily through being transported in infected wood.  In Louisiana authorities believe the prime method of spreading the termite has been through infested railroad ties such as is used for landscaping.  Louisiana is also monitoring or restricting the movement of telephone poles and other large timber. Dr. Matthew Messenger of Dow AgroSciences confirmed for TruthOrFiction.com that most of the trees in New Orleans are being run through chippers and either being burned or dumped into landfills.  Also, he says that the termites are soft-bodied, including the queen, and would probably not survive the chipping process. He adds that the only case he’s heard of where termites were found in mulch at a retail store was when the bags were left on the ground long enough that the termites infested them directly, not because they were from any trees that were used to make the mulch. TruthOrFiction.com also talked with with of the top experts on Formosan termites, Dr. Afhok Raina, Supervisory Research Entomologist, for the Formosan Termite Research Unit of the USDA.  He said that the chances are poor of any live termites from New Orleans ending up in bags of mulch going to other parts of the country.  He said that to begin with almost all of the damaged trees were underwater, which would have killed the termites.  He, too, said that the termites are not likely to have survived the chipping process and adds that if any live termites did end up in a bag of commercial mulch, they would not survive the heat that results from being sealed in a plastic bag especially if exposed to sunlight.  Dr. Raina said that there are concerns about termites in mulch, but that applies to mulch that already exists in a particular location and can easily become infested with local termites.  He says that he does not recommend that homeowners put mulch very close to their homes.  Pest control professionals will frequently establish a chemical barrier around the home to keep termites out.  He says that mulch can compromise that barrier and become the bridge for termites to regain access. One of the retail stores mentioned in the eRumor is Home Depot. TruthOrFiction.com contacted their corporate offices and was told that Home Depot does not sell mulch from any termite-infested trees and does not use any mulch suppliers from the New Orleans area.  The Mulch and Soil Council  (MSC) has established standards that are based on criteria for mulch and soil certification and inspection.  Home Depot requires that all mulch suppliers be certified by the MSC.

"," Pronged dog collars are a training tool that are suggested by professional dog trainers for dog owners who may have dogs that are harder to train. In order to work, they must be properly fitted so that the least amount of effort is used by the dog owner to train the dog to walk properly. This according to a spokesperson at the K9 Connection, who said that the collars are actually one of the safest collars to use because they do not put stress on the dog’s trachea and larynx. The injured dog in the photo may have been a result of improper use of a prong collar, or it may not have been properly fitted. Prong collars should only be used when training the dog and one that is too loose or too tight will lose its safety features. These collars should never be used on a dog for an extended period, for example, tying the dog in the back yard. The K9 Connection posted a two-part educational video on how to properly fit and use the collars on YouTube: Prong Collar Lesson part 1 Prong Collar Lesson part 2 The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) posted a handy guide of training tools for dogs on its website .

The company was purchased in 2007 by Pantry Inc., the Kangaroo convenience store chain with headquarters in Sanford, North Carolina. Prior to the Pantry Inc. acquisition Petro Express stores sold Citgo gasoline but according to an allbusiness.com report published October 18, 2006, the company decided to phase it out from its 45 locations in favor for their own name brand. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez drew the ire of Americans for his open opposition to the United States.  His most dramatic display was during a fiery speech before the United Nations in September of 2006 in which he called president Bush “the devil” and suggested that the United Nations should move elsewhere, perhaps Jerusalem. Because of Chavez’s hatred of the United States, many American motorists have called for a boycott of Citgo, a company now owned by Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., the national oil company of Venezuela.  Chavez died on March 5, 2013 at the age 58 after a bout with cancer that lasted close to two years.

"Senate Bill seeks to regulate “grass roots” lobbying-Truth! But Overturned!","2015-03-17 20:39:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lobbyists/"," An alert from the American Family Association (AFA) that says that a new bill (Senate Bill 1, Section 220) will “…effectively keep AFA and every other pro-family organization in America from providing you information on bills in Congress.” "," On January 18, 2007, senators removed language from a lobby reform bill that was opposed by numerous citizens organizations ranging from Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family to the American Civil Liberties Union. The legislation in Senate Bill 1, section 220, was part of what was being called the Lobby Reform Bill. It proposed changes regarding what lobbyists are required to disclose and how often.  It didn’t target any particular types of organizations, such as pro-life or pro-family, but a part of the bill, section 220, was about lobbyists who become involved in so called grassroots campaigns such as appealing to the general public to support or oppose legislation and to tell members of congress how they feel about it. Opponents of the legislation said it was an attempt to silence grassroots campaigns by putting reporting requirements on them that will cost a lot of time and money to implement.  They said, for example, that under the legislation any small group that sent out communication to more than 500 people will be required to register as a lobbying group and be subject to the reporting regulations.  Joining the American Family Association was Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family in expressing alarm about section 220.  In a statement released to its constituents, Focus on the Family said, “If S.1 passes with these outrageous provisions, communications from Focus Action, known as ‘grassroots communications,’ will be tied up in miles of new red tape. These bureaucratic restrictions are clearly a concerted effort to insulate legislators from criticism. At the same time, Section 220 will allow labor unions, trade associations and foreign corporations unregulated access to legislators. ”  The bill exempts organizations that are communicating directly with members, such as a labor union. Supporters of the bill, however, said that the reporting requirements apply only to organizations and lobbyists who were already required to register and who were spending a lot of money on lobbying activities.  In other words, it targeted the big lobbyists.  However, if an organization spent more than $24,500 semi-annually on direct lobbying activities, it would have been required to register as a lobbying entity and report on any grass roots activity as well.  So the mere sending of 500 communications would not have require an entity to register as a lobbyist and report on grass roots activities, but larger organizations like AFA and Focus on the Family would probably have had to register, which worried them. In an unusual alliance, one of the organizations that joined in opposition to section 220 was the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The provisions of section 220 are identical to legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate last March, which the ACLU encouraged its members to reject. “The right to petition the government is “one of the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,” the ACLU said in a statement.  “When viewed through this prism, the thrust of the grassroots lobbying regulation is at best misguided, and at worst would seriously undermine the basic freedom that is the cornerstone of our system of government.” Updated 1/18/07 ","Warnings"

This actually occurred near the location of one of our TruthOrFiction.com team members who is an avid sailor and very familiar with the facilities and waters around the Port of Long Beach. After the attack on America on September 11, 2001, security in our nation’s ports have been greatly enhanced. According to the Port of Long Beach website , nobody is permitted unescorted access within the port facilities without completing the necessary steps to obtain a Transportation Workers Identification Credential (TWIC). Also, a blockade from the water would not be an easy operation because the waters in the port are restricted only to commercial traffic. Private or recreational vessels in restricted waters are immediately reported by surveillance teams to the harbor police and U.S. Coast Guard. There was a blockade on Saturday, August 17, 2014, according to an August 18th. article by Britain’s Guardian a Zim cargo container was delayed when 2,000 and 3,000 pro-Palestinian activists gathered at the port entrance in Oakland, Ca. Once the ship was docked, the article said that the “protesters intended to form a picket line to prevent work crews from unloading the ship.” Posted 08/15/14 ","Warnings"

"Hitler’s Gun Control Laws Led to the Holocaust – Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:39:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hitler-gun-control/"," Adolph Hitler passed gun control laws to disarm Jewish people before the Third Reich carried out the Holocaust. "," No consensus has been reached among historians and social commentators about the impact of Hitler’s gun control laws in the years leading up to the Holocaust. The topic of gun control laws in Nazi Germany often emerges in political debate about second amendment rights and potential laws to restrict gun ownership in the U.S. The topic came to the forefront when Stephen Halbrook published his book “ Gun Control in the Third Reich” in 2013. Halbrook wrote that no gun laws or policies were in place in Germany after World War I. Gun laws were passed because firearms were not turned in after the war and there was fear that extremist groups would take up arms against the government. Hitler, then the chancellor of Germany, succeeded in enacting gun control policies that enabled the German government to seize arms and eradicate alleged enemies of state. Halbrook wrote that after passage of the “Enabling Law,” which gave Hitler power to create any laws he pleased, weapons confiscations intensified and Jews were not allowed to own guns by 1938. NRA President Wayne LaPierre made similar claims in his 1994 book “ Guns, Crime and Freedom .” However, historians have countered the claim that Hitler’s gun control laws played a significant role in the lead up to the Holocaust. Jews accounted for a very small population of Germany in the 1930s and lived under a dictatorship that had one of the strongest militaries on the planet at its disposal. Historian Steve Paulsson said Hitler’s firearms laws made no difference in the Jews’ long odds of survival in and around Germany at the time. Anti-Defamation League Deputy National Director Ken Jacobson told the Huffington Post that the rhetoric “undermines any real understanding of what the Holocaust was about” and that it was not a “serious examination of what the Nazi regime was about.” Posted 10/08/14 ","Warnings"

"Secret government spying on laptops?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/homeland-security-logger/"," The eRumor says it’s from the “Turner Radio Network” and claims that the author of the email has caught the government and computer manufacturers installing hard-wired keystroke loggers on new laptop computers. The message includes pictures and descriptions of a device that was found in a laptop. The email claims that an inquiry to the police resulted in his being referred to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A call to them resulted in his being told to make a request under the Freedom of Information Security Act. That resulted in a letter from Homeland Security saying the information he requested did not have to be revealed and he could appeal by writing to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Some versions of the eRumor say it is Dell that is selling the laptops with loggers on them. "," TruthOrFiction.com is declaring this to be a hoax. Most hoaxes of this nature have been quickly created with pictures and other resources found on the Internet. We did some searching and, surely enough, we found the original pictures of both the scanned letter from Homeland Security and the pictures of the alleged laptop keylogging device. First, there is such a device as a keylogger.  It’s a small piece of equipment that you can attach to your computer keyboard that keeps track of every character you type.  Some people use them as a back-up so they can retrieve what they’ve typed in case of a computer crash.  Others have them on their keyboards so they can tell whether someone else has been using their computer and for what purpose.  There are also companies that have installed keyloggers on various corporate computers for purposes of security.  There are also more controversial uses for keyloggers such as spying on other people and law enforcment is said to use them for that. One of the products that is sold to the consumer is called KeyGhost and is made in New Zealand.  There is a small, visible version that you simply install between your computer and your keyboard.  There is also a version that looks so much like a normal keyboard cable that you don’t know that it’s there. There is also a version of KeyGhost that is installed inside of desktop keyboards and is not visible.  The information is actually stored in the KeyGhost and you can download it later on any computer.  There is also a version that can send the keylogger information over the Internet to a different location. The pictures of the keylogger used in the eRumor were taken from an article about keyloggers posted on the KeyGhost website at www.keyghost.com. The letter from Homeland Security used in the eRumor is a hoax. You’ll  notice that the letter says it is regarding “File Number 20050112-20050119.”  Those are the file numbers listed on a scan of a letter from Homeland Security to Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and it had nothing to do with keylogging.  She was requesting documents about White House security procedures and the Secret Service.  The creator of this hoax found a scan of that letter on the Internet then doctored it with the alleged response about being denied access to his files. The reference to the “Turner Network” is because one of the versions of the eRumor has been posted on the website of an Internet radio talk show host on the Turner Network.

Police allege that in all cases those involved swiped their credit card into a hand-held machine and were given a receipt for their payment.”  Hennessey was held without bail and had 10 counts charged against him of “obtaining benefit by deception and one count of having stolen goods in his possession.” It is not known if there have been any copy cat incidents in the U.S.  On February 6, 2013 the Ann Arbor News published an article that warned  of a Sheriff’s Office alert of “a person delivering a gift of flowers and wine may ask the recipient to use a credit or debit card to pay a $3.50 delivery charge. ‘Paying’ with the card allows the scammer to steal the victim’s account information and then use it to get money at ATMs.” The Ann Arbor news said that the spokesperson for the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office called the alert a “heads up” and said his department had not received any reports of any local attempts.

The post claimed the explosion was “recently” caused by an overheated GPS unit that was left attached to the windshield of a car at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. Current emailed variations of the eRumor appear to be based on that report. Upon close inspection, however, the photos themselves disprove the eRumor. The vehicle pictured has a dashboard-mounted GPS system, which would seemingly render a standalone unit unnecessary. But like many eRumors, this one is based on a kernel of truth.

"," Experts say that White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillars are both poisonous and allergenic, but most people who encounter them experience mild symptoms, like itchy skin or a rash. The White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar’s longer white lashes are connected to poison glands inside the caterpillar’s body.

Those who experience skin irritation after touching a White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar should wash the sting with soap and water and dab the area with ammonia or calamine lotion. More serious side effects from the toxic chemical can result in swelling and nausea.

A: The law does not specifically prohibit that, but an officer can pull over and issue a citation to a driver of any age if, in the officer’s opinion, the driver was distracted and not operating the vehicle safely. Text paging while driving is unsafe at any speed and is strongly discouraged. DRIVERS UNDER 18 Q: Am I allowed to use my wireless telephone hands free? A: NO. Drivers under the age of 18 may not use a wireless telephone, pager, laptop or any other electronic communication or mobile services device to speak or text while driving in any manner, even hands free. EXCEPTION: Permitted in emergency situations to call police, fire or medical authorities. (VC §23124). Q: Why is the law stricter for provisional drivers? A: Statistics show that teen drivers are more likely than older drivers to be involved in crashes because they lack driving experience and tend to take greater risks. Teen drivers are vulnerable to driving distractions such as talking with passengers, eating or drinking, and talking or texting on wireless phones, which increase the chance of getting involved in serious vehicle crashes. Q: Can my parents give me permission to allow me to use my wireless telephone while driving? A: NO. The only exception is an emergency situation that requires you to call a law enforcement agency, a health care provider, the fire department or other emergency agency entity. Q: Does the law apply to me if I’m an emancipated minor? A: Yes. The restriction applies to all licensed drivers who are under the age of 18. Q: If I have my parent(s) or someone age 25 years or older in the car with me, may I use my wireless telephone while driving? A: NO. You may only use your wireless telephone in an emergency situation. Q: Will the restriction appear on my provisional license? A: No Q: May I use the hands-free feature while driving if my car has the feature built in? A: NO. The law prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from using any type of wireless device while driving, except in an emergency situation. Q: Can a law enforcement officer stop me for using my hands-free device while driving? A: No. For drivers under the age of 18, this is considered a SECONDARY violation meaning that a law enforcement officer may cite you for using a hands-free wireless phone if you were pulled over for another violation. However, the prohibition against using a handheld wireless telephone while driving is a PRIMARY violation for which a law enforcement officer can pull you over. Updated 3/15/08 ","Warnings"
"Wash your Undies!","2015-03-17 20:39:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/parasites-bras/"," This one is accompanied by both a photograph and a video of what is said to be parasites infesting a woman’s breast and creating a grotesque site. The story warns that women should be sure and wash a new bra to make sure any parasites have been eliminated. It also recommends ironing underwear for the same reason. It tells the story of an anthropologist named Susan McKinley who returned from a trip to South America with a rash that evolved into a worm-infested breast. "," We have not found anything to substantiate the Susan McKinley story or the photograph of the alleged larvae in a female breast.

The video that comes with some versions of the eRumor, however, is real but has nothing to do with either the story told in the eRumor or the photograph. The eRumor circulated for more than two years before the video started appearing attached to it. The video shows a close-up of a medical worker using tweezers to remove worms from a woman’s breast. It is from a case reported from Africa in which Nigerian woman has what is called “cutaneous myiasis” of the breast due to an infestation by the larva of the Tumbu fly. The medical report says it is the only reported instance of the infestation so there is no need for spreading an alarm. It is interesting, if not coincidental, to note that the woman who had the infestation was described as spreading her washed clothes outside for drying and not ironing them before wearing them. The eRumor makes reference to that as well and it brings up the question of whether the warning was initiated by someone who knew of the lone case. Some more recent versions of the story also include pictures of a couple of white worms that it says are the type that are infesting the breast. As is clear on the picture, however, it was taken by Michael Bohne of the U.S. Forestry service and is of the larva of the Asian longhorned beetle. It has nothing to do with any of the other stories.

"," This is one of the issues TruthOrFiction.com has often cited as an example of “urban legends that kill.” The spread of AIDS in Africa is startling and the debris in the lives of its people is heartbreaking.  Jeffrey Bartholet said in the 1/17/2000 issue of Newsweek that 85 percent of the world’s deaths from AIDS in 1999 were in Africa.  The life expectancy in some African countries is decreasing alarmingly.  In the same issue, a different article said there are millions of orphans in Africa whose parents have died of aids and that in Sub-Sahara Africa, 6,000 men and women are dying each day of AIDS. Added to that, however, is the rumor in parts of Africa, including large portions of South Africa, that having sex with a virgin will cleanse a male of AIDS.  The Johannesburg city council conducted a three-year study of about 28,000 men.  They found that 1 in 5 believed in the virgin-AIDS cure.  The fallout from that is a rise in assaults of women and children, some of whom contract AIDS themselves. Of particular alarm has been the rise in infant rapes.  Not all researchers blame that on the virgin-AIDS cure myth, but they believe it has contributed to it.  The rape of the nine-month-old by six men in Upington at the end of 2001 enraged many South Africans.  That was followed by the discovery of a seven-month-old who had been raped and left for dead in a suburb of Capetown in November, 2001.  There have been other high profile cases since. The eRumor asks readers to add their names to an email petition to protest the closing down of South Africa’s Child Protection Unit, but South Africa’s Minister of Safety and Security, Steve Tshwete, says the unit is not being closed.  That rumor got started in mid-2001 when a parliamentary committee convened to discuss the unit and observers though it meant the unit was in trouble. Christina Jordaan, a social worker for the Department of Education in South Africa, says there is a companion myth to the virgin-AIDS cure that says that if a girl has her hymen intact, she will not contract AIDS (CBS Healthwatch, 10/2000) Complicating the problem in South Africa is a revival of an old Zulu system of virginity testing.  According to the July, 1999 issue of the AIDS Information Newsletter, tens of thousands of young people in South Africa are participating in the practice in which an adult examines a girl for evidence of virginity.   Proponents say it promotes and honors abstinence, which helps cut down on sexual activity, pregnancy, and disease.  Opponents say it’s like advertising the virgins to potential perpetrators.  The girls who pass the test get white stars on their foreheads and a certificate of virginity. The belief in the virgin-AIDS cure is not restricted to Africa.  According to a Knight-Ridder report from Mark McDonald in January of 2000, it is also helping fuel an increase in child prostitution in Cambodia.  McDonald says there are many Asian men who believe that having sex with a virgin will cleanse their AIDS.  The same is true for India, according to the Fall, 1995 Harvard AIDS Review, and Jamaica, according to the Ministry of Health in Jamaica.  The belief in curing AIDS by having sex with a virgin is apparently an outgrowth of a long-standing belief in many cultures in the restorative and healing powers of virgins and having sex with virgins.

"," We don’t know whether this particular first-hand account is true but the concerns about Zircam are not fabricated. Zicam is the brand name of products from Matrixx Initiatives.  The company promotes its Zicam Cold Remedy nasal gel by saying that it shortens your cold.  Their website says it will “…help you get over your cold three times faster.”  Matrixx has several other Zicam products for both adults and children that are for flu, allergies, congestion, and sinus problems. Concerns about whether Zicam might be causing a loss of smell began accumulating in 2004.  Zicam contains a form of zinc (zinc gluconate) and medical researchers pointed to the 1930’s when another form of zinc (zinc sulfate) was used nasally in an attempt to protect from polio.  One of the results was that some users lost their sense of smell.  Matrixx countered by saying that the two forms of zinc should not be equated.   The anti-polio products had concentrated forms of the sulfate which, according to Matrixx, reacted with water to create a strong acid.  The gluconate in their product, said Matrixx, is a weak organic salt that dissolves into a “…naturally occurring, non toxic compound found in all human tissue.” Matrixx had strongly denied that Zicam destroys the sense of smell and taste and when contacted by TruthOrFiction.com about this story sent us a summary of a two-day meeting of its Scientific Advisory Board in September, 2004.  It said, “was the unanimous opinion of the Scientific Advisory Board that the cumulative scientific evidence does not support the contention that Zicam® Cold Remedy zinc gluconate nasal gel is associated with disorders of smell.”   The panel concluded that a loss of smell is most commonly associated with the common cold, sinusitis, and nasal injury and that there are statistically significant associations between the pernament loss of smell and numerous other medical conditions and multiple classes of drugs.  In other words, the board felt that there was not enough evidence in the midst of all those other factors to pinpoint Zicam as the culprit. Nonetheless, the lawsuits kept coming and in January, 2006, Matrixx, without admitting any fault, settled a class action lawsuit with 340 people for nearly $12 million. As of this writing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not looked into the Zicam complaints. Updated 10/27/06 ","Warnings"

The eRumor’s claim that President Obama won 100 percent of the vote in 59 districts in Philadelphia is true. In both the 2008 and 2012 elections, the president drew 100 percent of the vote in some districts in Philadelphia that are populated almost entirely by African-American people, CBS News reported. The claim that Obama lost in every state that required a photo ID to vote in 2012 is also true. Four states had strict ID laws on the books that required voters to show a photo ID to vote at the time: Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee and Indiana. Official election data from around the country proves the rest of the eRumor’s claims are false. Poll results from Wood County, Ohio , show that Obama didn’t receive 100 percent of the votes in any district there, which the eRumor claims. Overall, Obama won about 51 percent of the votes in Wood County. There also were not more votes cast than there are voters in St. Lucie County, Fla., as the eRumor claimed. Official election results show 123,301 votes were cast, and there were 175,554 registered voters. Challenger Mitt Romney earned 56,202 votes and Obama earned 65,869 in St. Lucie County. The eRumor also alleged there were more votes than registered voters at St. Lucie County’s SEAL Museum polling station, which is not true. The official election results show there were 2,756 registered voters in the district, and there were 2,243 votes cast. Likewise, the claim that voter turnout was at 141 percent in Palm Beach County, Fla., is false. The county’s supervisor of elections reported that about 70 percent of registered voters turned out.

"," This is quite an assault on Target stores and is becoming an example of how a rumor can mushroom and pick up momentum along the way. It started with a man named Dick Forrey. He is listed as being with Howard County Vietnam Veterans in the state of Indiana.  He says that he did have the experiences both with the local Target store and the Target corporate offices as is described in one of the stories and did originate an email expressing his displeasure.  It is not true, however, that Target categorically refuses to fund Veteran’s projects and even Forrey is upset with how large this eRumor has spread. The Target company is sending a written response to people who inquire about the Forrey story that says that Target gives $2 million per week in the communities where stores are located. The Target letter says a veteran (referring to Forrey) approached a local store in March, 2002 for a $100 donation to a “moving wall” project. The response says that any donations by local stores are not in cash but in gift certificates or volunteer time. Cash is given by the corporate office and in response to official requests for grants. The letter says that the veteran who asked for the donation should have been given grant information from the store, but was not. The Target response also says that the company makes donations in three general areas: education, arts and family violence prevention. The company is happy to donate to any veterans causes that would fit within those guidelines. So while it’s true that donations would not be given to a veterans project per se, they would be given if the veterans project is within the guidelines. Regarding Target’s ownership, the company is on record as a U.S. firm based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and always has been. There is no foreign ownership in its past or present that we’ve been able to find or been presented with evidence about.   Target is a public corporation and a list of their executive officers and board of directors can be found on the investor section of the company’s website . Regarding benefits for reservists on active duty, this has been a big issue since so many reservists were called in for service in the Middle East and the National Committee for Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve has been a watchdog of companies and how they treat reservists. They list target in the “Outstanding Employer” category which means it has “gone above and beyond the requirements of the law in support of their National Guard and Reserve employees.” So how did such a completely false email come into being? It’s easy to suspect a conspiracy or organized effort against Target but from our viewpoint this appears to have gotten started with the Dick Forrey letter and as others read it and got angry over it, they added other false charges in order to stack the deck. In 2011 this eRumor once again gained momentum after Target began operations in Canada.   Someone added “2013” to the subject of the eRumor and in the summer of that year this oldie rose from the ashes and once again went viral on the World Wide Web.

According to a release from California Senator Dianne Feinstein she has joined with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa to sponsor a bill in congress that would make it a federal crime to appeal to children with candy-flavored meth or other drugs.  Feinstein said that substances like “Strawberry Quick” are “…designed to get people to try it a few times.  It’s all about hooking young people, and we have to stop this practice before it grows any further.” ","Warnings"
"Dog Owner experianced problems with ProMeris Flea and Tick Treatment-Depends on How It is Used!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/promeris/"," The originator of the email, a woman named Kathryn L. Leinthall, says that she had “debilitating” results using ProMeris flea and tick treatment on her 7 dogs and that she was affected by the product as well.  Her message says that within less than 2 hours of receiving the treatment, 4 of her dogs had vomited, were disoriented, were stumbling, and had other symptoms.  The dog owner says that in addition, she also began having symptoms such as swollen lips, red eyes, and disorientation.  All 7 of her dogs, she says, were admitted to a veterinary hospital and she was taken to a hospital emergency room. "," Kathryn Leinthall is real and lives in Interlaken, New York. Her    experience with ProMeris is also real. ProMeris is a product that its maker, Fort Dodge, describes as flea and    tick treatment that “effectively stops and controls existing flea    infestations for up to seven weeks in cats and six weeks in dogs.” It is sold only through veterinarians, not over-the-counter. Fort Dodge said that although there seem to be several different events of    adverse reactions being reported on the Internet, their investigation into    the matter concluded that all of the reports stem from a single case. The company acknowledges that on Friday, April 11, it received a report    from a veterinarian involving six Siberian Huskies and one mixed-breed dog    that experienced reactions to ProMeris. According to Fort Dodge the    clinical signs reported are similar to what they have seen in their safety    studies when there was deliberate oral exposure to ProMeris.  But the    product is designed to be absorbed through the skin, not through    ingestion. Fort Dodge said that the most common adverse effect reported since    ProMeris was introduced to the market was lethargy, which can happen if    the dog orally ingests ProMeris. The company reminded pet owners    that ProMeris is designed to be applied in just one location on the dog:    onto the skin between the shoulder blades.  It should not be applied    on the surface of the dog’s coat or other    locations on the dog’s body.  Putting ProMeris between the shoulder    blades prevents the dog from licking it.  Putting it elsewhere,    especially on the surface of the dog’s hair, increases the risk of the dog    ingesting it orally and possibly experiencing the symptoms described.

"Warnings about propane tanks used for making meth-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/propane-tanks/"," An alert from a police officer in Oklahoma about a danger involving recycled propane tanks.  She says that people are stealing propane tanks from retailers and using them to transport anhydrous ammonia, a substance used in making illegal meth.  They may then exchange them back to the retailers, which consumers need to be aware of because the anhydrous ammonia is corrosive and may render the tank dangerous for future use.  She recommends that if you get a tank at a refill station that has blue or green residue around the valve, don’t use it. "," It’s not clear how widespread this threat is, but the same warning is being issued by numerous law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Canada. The problem is that the anhydrous ammonia used in making methamphetamine can corrode the valve at the top of the tank, making it dangerous to use.  If any of the anhydrous ammonia happens to be in the tank, that can be dangerous as well to skin and lungs.  Thieves not only use the small propane tanks for storing the ammonia, but for stealing it from larger tanks at businesses or farms. Most of the other warnings we’ve seen from law enforcement also say to look for blue, green, or blue-green residue around the valve as possible evidence that the tank may have been used with the ammonia. The National Propane Gas Association has issued an alert about the problem.  In a statement, the association said, “The brass valve in a propane cylinder will be damaged if it comes in contact with anhydrous ammonia. This deterioration will lead to cracking of the valve body or its components and can ultimately result in a violent, unexpected expulsion of the valve from the cylinder, causing personal injury or death.” So far, we’ve not found a case in which a consumer has experienced problems because of a recycled propane tank damaged by use in making meth.  It doesn’t seem likely that meth makers would return used tanks to refill stations unless they happened to want some propane.  The signs of contamination on the tanks would be a tip-off to the refill stations that a criminal may be present. Ohio State University issued a warning to farmers who use anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen-based fertilizer.  The farmers usually have large tanks of the ammonia and meth makers steal small quantities by using the barbecue type propane tanks.  Among other warnings, the university urged farmers to be wary about any consumer tanks found on their property that have the signs of contamination and, therefore, the threat of injury. It is recommended that if you spot the signs of contamination when purchasing a cylinder, refuse it.  If you discover that you have a tank with signs of contamination, don’t move it.  Call your local fire department for proper handling and disposal.  Or you can contact the National Propane Gas Association at 1-800-728-2482.

Johnson and Johnson, the parent company of the makers of Purell, told     TruthOrFiction.com that the circulated email is not authentic but that     they do not know who originated it.

In 1998 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration studied the safety of a     particular brand of ethanol-based gel hand cleaner, the Sanitizer Gel     Dispensing System.  The conclusion was that the gel did not     spontaneously ignite when exposed to elevated temperatures and even when     it was lighted into an open flame, it was easily extinguished.      Even putting a full bottle of the product into flames did not result in     fire.

"Haiti Made a Pact with the Devil-Disputed!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pat-robertson-haiti/"," In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January, 2010, Christian television broadcaster Pat Robertson made headlines by saying that Haiti had been “cursed by one thing after another” ever since the Haitian revolution of the late 1700’s when the Haitians “swore a pact to the devil.” "," Robertson created a firestorm of reaction for his statements, which seemed to suggest that the earthquake may have been directly related to Haiti’s supposed agreement with Satan. Robertson said, “They were under the heel of the French, you know Napoleon III and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said ‘We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.’ True story. And so the devil said, ‘OK it’s a deal’. And they kicked the French out.” There are several problems, however, with Robertson’s statement. First, the Haitians were not fighting against the famous Napoleon III, who was not yet born and was not to come to power until the mid 1800’s. But more importantly, the “pact to the devil” is not an event that is simple to pin down, although it has been a story that has been repeated, especially among Christian missionaries and writers, for many years. There are varying versions but they all conclude that during a historic meeting that led to the Haitian revolution, Satan was called upon for help in a Voodoo ceremony and there was a pig sacrificed on the occasion. Some popular versions also claim there is an iron pig monument to the ceremony in the capitol city of Port Au Prince, but that is rumor and the monument does not exist. Roberson was referring to a meeting that is said to have taken place at Bois-Caïman (or Bwa Kayiman) near Cap-Haitien in Northern Haiti on August 14, 1791 and was led by a man named Duffy Boukman. Historians seem to agree that such a meeting did happen but there is debate among some scholars about the details and especially the descriptions of the voodoo ceremony. The event is an important part of Haitian history because it is regarded as the inspirational and organizational launch of Haiti’s War of Independence, which 13 years later marked the only place in the world where African slaves succeeded in ending slavery and building an independent country. There is a lack of contemporary sources about the voodoo ceremony, however, and the first mention of it seems to be in a book published in 1814 by a French Doctor named Antoine Dalmas. He told of a feast or sacrifice held by black slaves that involved the sacrifice of a pig. He said it was held a week earlier than the Bois-Caïman gathering, however, and about six miles away at a location called Morne Rouge. There are other historic descriptions of the August 14 meeting that do not include the voodoo ritual and there is the suggestion that perhaps the two events got merged in later telling of the story. Later accounts describe Boukman as a voodoo priest, and a prayer is popularly circulated that was allegedly prayed by Boukman during the ceremony, although that was attached to him long after the event and there are scholars who doubt that he actually prayed it. Regardless, the Bois-Caïman event, including the voodoo ceremony and the Boukman prayer, has been embraced as an important part of Haitian history and has been retold by everyone from historians to the presidents of Haiti for many years. Even if the story is true, Haitians object to the accusation that any of that meant that they made a pact with the devil. Satan is not a part of voodoo. They have their own pantheon of various gods representing everything from a creator to deities of rain, thunder, fire, and trees. It was the missionaries, they say, who called their religion satanic and who, then, regarded their rituals as pacts with the devil, but to say that they appealed to Satan and dedicated themselves to him is the result of layering Christian thought on Haitian history. updated 01/18/09 ","Warnings"

It also suggests that in May of 2001, there was a successful       grass-roots effort to drive down gas prices by boycotting certain       companies. "," There are several issues in this eRumor. First, does the purchase of Middle Eastern oil help terrorism. There are varying voices on that. Some say that since Osama Bin Laden’s family made its money mostly from construction and that Bin Laden has been estranged from the family for quite a while, there isn’t any direct link. Others say that oil purchased from countries like Iraq goes directly toward support of terrorism and that profits for other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, indirectly aid terrorism because of wealthy Saudis who are said to help finance people like Osama Bin Laden. Second, what oil companies buy Middle Eastern oil? We were able to secure the statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy for various oil companies for calendar Year 2000: Shell purchased 3,611,000 barrels from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia BP purchased none from the Middle East. Chevron purchased 14,724,000 from the Middle East. Citgo-None from the Middle East. Amoco purchased 3,611,000 barrels from the Middle East.

"Social Security for Illegal Immigrants who have not contributed? Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/petition-illegals/"," A couple of these are circulating, both in the form of petitions. One says that the U.S. Senate has voted to allow illegal aliens to collect on Social Security even though they have not paid into the Social Security System. Another is an internet petition originated by Californians that is to be sent to President Bush, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and several members of Congress from California.  It says that the U.S. Senate voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants and protests it..  It asks that citizenship be required for eligibility for Social Services, that no free services or funding be given to illegal immigrants, and that no college education be provided free to illegals either. "," First, Internet petitions have, so far, been of limited or no value.  They do not bear the same weight of signed petitions since anybody who wants to take the time could generate them and just make up the names.  These petitions also depend on someone to ultimately send them to the right addresses, which is not a reliable way to get them there. Second, let’s look at each of the issues in the eRumors. The Senate Vote on Social Security that generated this petition was in May, 2006. The effect of that vote was to allow language in other legislation on the issue to proceed.  It would not have granted Social Security benefits to all illegal aliens but it would have allowed illegal aliens who had already paid into Social Security to accrue the benefits of their contributions.  The Senate went on to pass a controversial immigration bill but it differed greatly from a version passed in the House of Representatives. Social Security As of this writing, Illegal immigrants are not benefiting much from Social Security.  It’s technically illegal to hire an undocumented worker so theoretically there should not be any paying into Social Security.  But because of so many illegal workers who use bogus Social Security cards to get jobs, billions of dollars of Social Security deductions are made each year as well as employer payments into Social Security on behalf of those workers. Illegals are not supposed to collect on Social Security and because their Social Security numbers are manufactured, they cannot collect so the money has become a part of the controversy over Illegal immigration.  There have been some estimates that more than $60 billion a year are being paid into the system because of illegal immigrants, money that would disappear if the immigrants did. Immigration reform being debated in Congress could affect all this such as if amnesty is granted to illegal aliens currently residing in the U.S. or if illegal aliens are given some kind of participation in the Social Security system.  There is no legislation, however, that would give illegal aliens Social Security payments if they have not paid into Social Security. Social Services Let’s look at this from the standpoint of California since that is the concern of the petition and is the state with the largest population of illegal immigrants. A wide range of services are available in California for illegal immigrants including health care and education for children. College Tuition At present in-state college tuition rates are available to undocumented immigrants as long as they meet other standards such as residency requirements. Updated 3/30/07 ","Warnings"

The original eRumor was in various forwarded emails in 2005 saying that large retailers like Wal-Mart and Target are minimizing “Christmas” and emphasizing “holidays” at the end of the year and even telling their employees to stop using “Merry Christmas.” "," Regarding the 2007 update and Lowes, the American Family Association said that it received word from Lowes that the company was “proudly committed to selling Christmas trees” and said that calling them “Family Trees” was an error that was not caught before the catalog was distributed.  Lowes told the AFA that it would refer to them as “Christmas trees” during other advertising during the Christmas season.” Christmas 2005 was the year of  the “greeting wars” between Christians and American retailers. This story had several sources. The American Family Association posted a petition on their website for  people to sign in protest of decisions it says have been made by several  retailers to ban the use of “Merry Christmas” in advertising  and in-store promotion.  The American Family Association action was  originally about Target Stores, which it said, had banned using  “Merry Christmas” in its stores, something that Target denied. Popular Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly did a show on which he  offered a list of retailers that he said refused to use “Merry  Christmas” in their store advertising. The Reverend Jerry Falwell lent his support to the “Friend of Foe  Christmas Campaign” that was launched by the conservative legal  organization Liberty Counsel, which promised to take legal action  against anyone who spread what it saw as misinformation about how  Christmas can be celebrated in schools and public spaces. There was also a brief protest against Wal-Mart led by The Catholic  League, which said that Wal-Mart was discriminating against Christmas  while promoting alternative holiday celebrations such as Kwanzaa and  Hanukkah. The Catholic League published the contents of an email it says  was received from Wal-Mart by a woman who complained that “Merry  Christmas” was being replaced by “Happy Holidays.”   According to the Catholic League, the email said: “Walmart  is a world wide organization and must remain conscious of this. The  majority of the world still has different practices other than “christmas”  which is an ancient tradition that has its roots in Siberian shamanism.  The colors associated with “christmas” red and white are  actually a representation of of the aminita mascera mushroom. Santa is  also borrowed from the Caucuses, mistletoe from the Celts, yule log from  the Goths, the time from the Visigoth and the tree from the worship of  Baal. It is a wide wide world. “ The  boycott was called off after being given visibility on WoldNetDaily.   The Catholic League said that Wal-Mart apologized for the email, field  the employee who wrote it, and made some changes to its website that  reflect “Christmas,” not just “holidays.” In an official statement Target said it “…serves and employs a  diverse range of people…” and that their “…merchandise,  advertising, and marketing include a diversity of traditions,  particularly at this time of year.”  Target denied that it has  asked employees to avoid saying “Merry Christmas” and let  that decision rest with the employee. A visit to the Target website at www.target.com by TruthOrFiction.com in late November, 2005, seemed to confirm the  avoidance of Christmas except as it related to specific products. There  was nothing on the home page about “Christmas” or “Merry  Christmas.”  Instead the references were to a “Holiday  Gift Finder” feature and gift cards decorated with snowmen and  Christmas trees but termed “Holiday Gift Cards.”  On the  Holiday Gift Finder page there are links for “All Things  Holiday,” “Holiday Catalogs”, and “Holiday Shipping  Dates.”  At the Lowes website (www.lowes.com) there was what   was clearly a red and green Christmas tree stand but it’s called  “The Ultimate Holiday Tree Stand.”  The same with Wal-Mart. Sears, Home Depot, Costco, and KMart although  this is not a new trend.  We went through the archives of several  of the homepages for major retailers extending back to 1997 and found  that most of them by that time had begun referring to  “holidays” rather than “Christmas” largely because  of the trend of regarding November through January as both Jewish and  Christian holidays in the U.S. Last updated 11/27/05 ","Warnings"

"," TruthOrFiction.Com was contacted a spokesperson at Kimberly-Clark who gave us an official statement saying that “there is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues.”  The statement also said that such customer complaints are rare but when Kimberly-Clark hears about them they follow up to ensure the safety of their products. Here is their statement : At HUGGIES, nothing is more important than the safety of the little ones who use our products. Families have put their trust in HUGGIES diapers for decades and all of our diapers have been thoroughly tested to ensure they are safe. Our primary interest remains with the wellbeing of the child involved. When we first learned about this report, we immediately reached out to the mom to express our concern and learn as much as we could about what happened. In addition to requesting samples of the diapers used by the mom for testing, we also initiated an internal review. While we have not yet received any samples from this consumer, our internal review has not found any product issues or abnormalities. We understand how deeply moms care about the health of their baby’s skin and we are always troubled by any report of skin irritation. In each and every case, we try to work closely with the moms to learn about their individual situation to ensure that our products can better meet their needs and help inform our ongoing product development. All of our products must pass stringent safety reviews prior to making it to retailer shelf. This review includes the superabsorbent material in question which has been thoroughly evaluated by more than 450 medical and scientific studies and has been used safely for years in our HUGGIES products and across the diaper industry. There is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues. Complaints of this nature are highly unusual – in fact over the past six months the rate is about one for every 40 million diapers sold. We take our responsibility to provide families with products they can use with confidence very seriously, and will continue to do everything we can to understand what occurred and how we can help. Additional Background The Superabsorbent materials (SAM) found in HUGGIES diapers is being used in virtually all disposable diapers on the market today. Superabsorbent materials (SAM), also known as polyacrylate absorbents, are a family of polymers that have extraordinary absorbency — the particles will absorb up to 100 times their weight in moisture. The safety of superabsorbent material has been proven in more than 450 consumer safety tests that have studied every way a person could come in contact with it — through skin contact, ingestion or even inhalation. Each study has consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this material. The crystals in the diaper are forms of a superabsorbent material that’s been used in diapers for many years. The superabsorbent material looks like a tiny bead when it’s dry and looks like a gel when it’s wet (and mixed with the other fluffy fibers in the diaper). Superabsorbent material in diapers offers significant benefits, like drawing wetness away from baby’s skin and helping to keep baby’s skin healthy. In HUGGIES diapers, superabsorbent material is mixed with the fluffy diaper padding. This material turns liquid into a gel, helping to prevent leakage. Occasionally, you may see small beads of gel on the diaper or on your baby, but the gel is nontoxic and not harmful. Posted 11/7/13  Updated 11/13/13 ","Warnings"

This law, known as FATCA, makes U.S.   residents accountable for money invested in foreign banks by requiring   the offshore financial institutions to provide a 1099 form to the Internal Revenue Service for their American customers.    This according to a July 28, 2013 article by The Hill , a new service that reports on the   business of the U.S. Government in Washington, D.C. The article said, “ Under   FATCA, banks will be forced to submit information on total assets,   account balances, transactions, account numbers and other personal   identifying information. This intrusion goes way beyond a 1099 and would   not be accepted or tolerated by Americans living in United States. ”     Noncompliance will result in huge financial penalties and sanctions to   the foreign financial institutions. The Hill added that   neither Congress, the Internal Revenue Service nor the U.S. Department   of Treasury are certain how much FACTA will generate in terms of revenue   in taxes.   The article said that President Obama “suggested   $210 billion over ten years,” and $800 billion over the course of ten   years was projected by unnamed  “others.” It is not really known what   ramifications this law will have on U.S. residents with funds in foreign   banks or if foreign banks will cooperate with the law.

"," This eRumor began circulating in April, 2008. It is true that some of these companies are facing tough times    financially, but not all of them are going out of business.     Bankruptcy sometimes means they are closing their doors.  But    sometimes it also means that they are reorganizing and intend to continue.     Sometimes other companies may purchase them out of bankruptcy. The Wall Street Journal said on April 28, 2008, that bankruptcy laws do    not require companies to redeem gift certificates so a lot of consumers    might end up with worthless cards.  Not all the struggling companies    are handling gift certificates the same way. Let’s go through the list: Hollywood Video Hollywood Video’s parent company, Movie Gallery, announced plans at    the end of 2007 to reorganize through bankruptcy.  As of this writing    Hollywood Video is still operating although a lot of stores have been    closed as a part of the reorganization. Levitz Furniture Levitz is currently in the process of liquidating assets and the only    advice the company has had for holders of gift cards is to file a claim in    bankruptcy court.  Consumers are usually the last in line when bills    are being paid, however. Sharper Image Sharper Image filed bankruptcy in February, 2008, and for a while it    stopped accepting gift cards.  It later began accepting them again    but customers needed to buy something worth double the card’s value and    were required to use the full amount of the card.

"Gift Card Scam Warning-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/giftcardscam/"," A warning that crooks are taking down the card numbers of gift cards in retail stores before they are purchased and activated–then later going online and using the activated cards for shopping sprees. "," The story is true and the procedure has been used by crooks, but it’s not clear how widespread it is.  So far the warning seems to be larger than the problem. One of the alerts was sent by the Hanover County Sheriff’s Office in Virginia, which confirmed with TruthOrFiction.com that the story is true. Here are the facts: Gift cards are frequently found displayed for sale in retail stores, but they are useless until they are purchased and activated.  The activation also determines how much money is on the card. According to the eRumor, thieves are copying down the numbers on the unsold cards..  Some of them, for example, may grab a handful of from a display, go into a restroom to copy the information from them, then return them.   Some cards have personal identification (PIN) numbers on them but they are hidden under a scratch-off covering.  Some of the thieves go ahead and scratch that off so they can have the PIN numbers as well and unless you are aware of that, you may not notice that the PIN number was once concealed. Later when the cards have been purchased and activated, the thieves will use the cards, typically for purchases online. So there is the danger that a gift card that you purchased may end up being worthless because the money will be gone before you spend it. The eRumor recommends that you get a gift card from an employee behind a counter rather than use the ones that are displayed for all to see. Retailers have been tight-lipped about the problem, presumably because they don’t want to give visibility to the idea so it is hard to judge how widespread the problem is..  Joseph LaRocca, vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation, says there is concern about gift card fraud but that the losses he’s aware of have been “miniscule.”   And most of those have not been the result of stolen card numbers but rather from crooked employees such as store clerks or restaurant servers who give you back a blank card when you have given them a full card to use for a purchase. LaRocca also warned against buying gift cards being offered online by private parties.  Consumers have been tricked either by receiving cards that did not have the values that were claimed or were gift cards that were purchased with stolen credit cards.   LaRocca said that a couple of years ago retailers did a survey of gift cards purchased over the Internet and 70% of them were either purchased with stolen money or were not the value that the purchasers thought they were. A Washington resident told KOMO-TV in Seattle that she and some friends from a church group chipped in for a $150 gift card from Wal-Mart as a gift to a colleague.  When the friend tried to use it, she was told that the card was empty and that someone else had already used it.  Another woman told KOMO that she had the same experience but with a $25 card.  It had been purchased in Olympia, Washington, but used by a stranger at a Wal-Mart in Chehalis even though the woman had never let the card out of her possession.

Hupe said she took two keys from her television station’s own fleet and started trying to open doors on a variety of GM cars.  She was able to open several other cars (all with the permission of the owners).  Some of the doors opened only after some jiggling with the key in the locks—but they opened. ABC-13 in Lynchburg, Virginia conducted a similar test.  Not every car opened with the GM key, but enough did to convince them that the threat was real.  They talked with a locksmith who said that the biggest risk is valuables stored in the car.  Even though the key may open the door, it doesn’t mean the key will work in the ignition, which has more tumblers in the lock. This is apparently not new information both to a lot of car owners who have made the discovery themselves and to thieves who prowl parked cars looking for things to steal.  We even found that sets of GM keys are available on the Internet from sites that boast that the keys will open the majority of GM cars.  Sets of keys are available for Fords as well. The bottom line is to avoid leaving valuables in the car and to make sure you have some kind of an alarm system that would prevent any thief from getting away with a break-in, according to the locksmiths.

Doctors determined that she was intoxicated. The eRumor says her blood alcohol level (BAC) was 85 percent, which   nobody would survive so that figure is obviously wrong.   A   BAC of .40% would be considered a lethal level. Hand sanitizers have an alcohol level of more than 60 percent.  Hard liquor, by comparison, is 40 percent alcohol while most beers are less than 5 percent alcohol.

"," The most incendiary part of this eRumor is the information about a number being required under the skin of the left hand—and it is false.  It hearkens to several other eRumors that have circulated about people being required to have identification chips implanted into their bodies or on their right hands or foreheads, which brings up speculation about Biblical prophecy about “The End Times.” The heart of the eRumor is about the “Federal Tax ID Number.”  There is no such terminology about individual citizens but there has been legislation passed in the U.S. Congress under what was called the REAL ID act and that sought to establish minimum standards for driver’s licenses and identification cards that would be acceptable by Federal Agencies.   The legislation prohibits Federal Agencies from accepting IDs for any official purposes that have not been issued based on the requirements of the act, although some states will get extensions and there will be a phasing-in period of 5-years for everything to be working correctly.  The Department of Homeland Security says this is not a “National ID Card.”  It is simply an attempt to establish common standards for states to issue licenses and identication cards.  The licenses will be issued from each state, not the Federal government. Driver’s licenses are accepted as legitimate ID at airports, for example, when you show up to board a flight.  That means that the issuance of a driver’s license should be based on the kind of documentation that will prove that the person who is getting it is really who he or she claims to be.  The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the reliability and accuracy of ID documents.  The commission report said that for terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons and that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers had some kind of identifying document, some by fraud. Regarding the woman’s ordeal in getting her license, it is not hard to understand what she was required to provide.  If you come to California from another state, a valid driver’s license is accepted as ID for a California license, but not an expired one.  If your name has changed, such as through marriage or divorce, you are required to have the documentation of that change in order to either get a license or have a name changed on a license. The part of the eRumor that says a number will be required under the skin of your left hand may have been prompted by questions about whether some of the states may want to embed what are called RFID devices in the drivers licenses.  RIFD stands for “radio frequency identification” and refers to small, inexpensive chips that are increasingly used for a variety of things including identifying products in stores.  It’s a high-tech electronic substitute for bar codes.  An RIFD chip doesn’t require a battery and merely needs to be passed near a special device to be read.  RIFD devices have also been implanted into animals for identification purposes and there is some use of RIFD devices being implanted in humans for the same reason.  That led a big eRumor several years ago about a chip made by Mondex and that it was going to be used by governments to track and control its citizens.  For more information about that, CLICK HERE.

"Haiti Disaster Relief Information- Alert!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/disaster-relief-haiti/"," Beware of scammers passing themselves off as relief organizations asking for donations.  They could be phishing or attempting to steal  your financial information. "," There are scammers who come to life during a time of disaster and who will try to trick us into giving money to them instead of worthy relief organizations and who will, as well, try to get our personal financial information for identity theft. Here are some important things to keep in mind: 1. Do not respond to any email appeals for funds no matter who they appear to be from. If you get an email that seems to be from the Red Cross, for example, don’t assume that it really is. The scammers are able to put a link into the email that appears to be going to the Red Cross but in reality is linking to one of their own sites. Other appeals will appear to be from particular individuals who are claiming to be victims of the disaster and asking for direct donations but who, in reality, are not. 2. Do not respond to any phone solicitations for the same reason. You do not know whether the people calling are really giving the funds to the organizations they claim to represent or whether your credit card information is being given to a trusted source. 3. The way to make a donation is to go directly to the official web site of any organizations you trust or to call them on the phone directly. If there are relief organizations that you know and trust, just do a web search such as through www.google.com and find that group’s official web site to make your contribution. 4. Avoid responding to requests for donations of clothing, tents, diapers, medicine, water, or food that are being collected to be sent to Haiti. Even if the effort is sincere, the chances of the goods getting there are very small. It is better to donate to relief organizations that are already there and buying and shipping such goods in bulk. Well meaning campaigns to collect goods to be sent to a disasater area usually result in warehouses full of things that never get there. Getting transportation of the goods is very difficult and then ensuring that even if they arrive that they won’t fall into the hands of corrupt government officials, black marketers, or thieves is very difficult. There are numerous good relief organizations, but here are some examples if you would like to make donations that you know will be helping the people of Haiti: The American Red Cross World Vision Mercy Corps has teams on the ground in Haiti Mission Aviation Fellowship has operated in Haiti for decades and provides air transportation for relief teams and supplies.

Small kits can be purchased for low power VHF transmitters but their distances only range to about 25 to 50 feet.   Licenses issued by the FCC would also be required to use this equipment. In order to transmit images and sound over great distances higher power transmitting equipment and tall antenna towers would be needed.   Average television studio transmitter equipment consists of 19″ wide components that are mounted in metal racks ranging from 4 to 6 feet in height.

Most packaging of cocoa mulch makes it clear that it’s not for human or animal consumption.  It also appears that all cocoa mulch is not the same.  One manufacturer we checked with, the maker of Mirana cocoa mulch, said that their mulch is the result of a series of processing steps and that the level of theobromine in their mulch is barely detectable. We did find at least one documented case reported in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)..  The report says that a dog that had ingested cocoa mulch developed convulsions and died 17-hours later.  An analysis of the stomach showed ingested cacao bean shells and lethal levels of theobromine. The AVMA has issued a release because of this new eRumor about cocoa mulch.  It says that according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), there have not been any reports in 2006 of animals dying from cocoa mulch ingestion.  In the years spanning 2004 and 2005 there were 16 cases of cocoa mulch ingestion reported, none of which resulted in death. The ASPCA says that the account of the death of the dog named Calypso that is in the eRumor is “suspect.”  The symptoms are not completely consistent with death from cocoa bean ingestion.  The ASPCA says that although vomiting is a common result, the dog is described as having had a single seizure the next day during a walk and then dying suddenly, which is not what would be expected.

"CFL Light Bulb Warning","2015-03-17 18:06:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cfl-mercury/"," The eRumor tells the story of a woman who accidentally dropped and broke an energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL).  After calling the store from which she bought it and being referred to a state agency, she was told to call a professional hazardous waste clean-up company, which told her it was going to cost more than $2,000 to deal with the problem.  The email warns about the downside of the CFLs. "," We’ve checked with several     sources including the Environmental Protection agency and there is no     question that CFLs contain mercury, but the consensus is that the     consequences of breaking one do not need to be as expensive as depicted     in the eRumor. The story told is that of Brandy Bridges from Prospect, Maine.  She     did go through the steps described in the article but according to the     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of     Environmental Protection, State of Maine, she did not have to.      Once you’ve called a professional environmental clean-up organization,     it is required to handle any hazardous substance according to the     dictates of state law, which could be expensive. In all of the states that we checked, however, even though specific     steps should be taken to clean-up of a broken bulb, it is not required     that it be handled by expensive professionals.  Also, although any     levels of mercury should cause concern, the amount of mercury released     by the bulbs is relatively small. The Maine Bureau of Remediation & Waste Management gives the     following advice if a fluorescent bulb breaks in the home: 1.  Never use a vacuum to clean up the breakage     because it may spread mercury dust in the air. 2.  Keep     people and pets away from the scene of the break. 3.  Ventilate the area. 4.  If possible, reduce the temperature of the     room. 5.  Wear protective equipment such as rubber     gloves, safety glasses, a dust mask and old clothing. 6.  Remove large pieces and place is secure,     closed or airtight plastic bag. 7.  Collect smaller pieces and dust using a     disposable dustpan and broom. 8.  Put all material into an airtight plastic     bag.  Pat the breakage area with the sticky side of something like     duct tape.  Wipe the area with a damp cloth or paper towels to pick     up the rest. 9.  Put the debris and any materials used to     clean it up into a secure closed container and label it “Universal     Waste -Broken Lamp.” 10.  Take the container for recycling of universal waste. The Bureau also recommends that before     replacing a fluorescent lamp, spread a drop cloth on the floor so any     accidental breakage can more easily be cleaned up. How much mercury is in the average CFL?  According to the EPA there     are about 4mg compared with 500mg in the average mercury thermometer and     3000mg in the average older thermostat.

A spokesperson for the Salisbury Fire Department in Maryland, where the eRumor and photos appeared in an April 2012 newsletter , told the TruthorFiction.com Team the story is false and has been retracted. Some CFL light bulbs do, however, contain a small amount of mercury. The scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives reported that CFL bulbs contain three to five milligrams of mercury — about one hundredth the amount found in older thermostats. Such a small amount of mercury doesn’t pose much of a health risk, and an even smaller amount of mercury escapes from broken CFL bulbs. Another scientific study that appeared in the journal Environmental Engineering Science found broken CFL bulbs release 0.04 to 0.7 milligrams of mercury. It would take weeks for that amount of mercury vapor to reach hazardous levels in a room. Still, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests that precautions be taken if a CFL bulb breaks.

"," The video is a commentary by Jerry Day, a media producer in Burbank, Ca. Day affirms that the US Constitution authorizes the government to conduct a census every ten years to freshly count the U.S. population.  He questions, however, whether the government has any Constitutional authority to do anything beyond that.  He also objected to the long list of questions being asked by the 2010 Census. In the video, Day voiced his concerns questioning where the government received the authority to conduct surveys every year and what private information can be requested.  Day also said that unless census takers can show you their constitutional authority that citizens are not required to open the door for them. According to the 2010 US Census web site there ten questions which will be asked by census takers: 1.   How many people were living or staying in this house, apartment or mobile home on April 1, 2010? 2.   Were there any additional people staying here on April 1, 2010 that you did not include in question 1?

(specify race by checking boxes that apply) 10. Does this person sometimes live somewhere else?  (check boxes that apply) The founding fathers of the United States used term “enumeration” (meaning “count”) in article 1 section 2 of the U.S. Constitution which allows a census or a population count to be conducted every 10 years to determine the number of representatives needed in Congress.  The Constitution mandates the number in the House of Representatives shall not exceed one per 30,000 people residing in each state. Anyone considering not answering all the questions on the 2010 Census should consider the consequences.

Brown recluse spiders are primarily found in the Southern United States and portions of the Midwest.  According to the Department of Entomology at the University of California at Riverside, bites from the brown recluse spider are relatively rare and most people who are bitten do not develop nasty symptoms. The pictures of reported spider bites commonly show a “slow healing necrotic lesion.” Experts warn, however, that not every case of gruesome pictures may be from a reclusive spider bite. There has been a lot of publicity, especially on the Internet, about the effects of the bite of the brown reclusive spider but doctors caution that an injury should not be classed as a spider bite unless the spider has been seen doing the biting.  In Canada, for example, there have been several cases reported of brown reclusive spider bites even though there are no brown reclusive spiders that live that far north. Robert G. Bennett and Richard S.Vetter are professional entomologists. In an article in Canadian Family Physician magazine in August, 2004, they said that 80 percent of spider-bite diagnoses are in error and that when someone gets a necrotic lesion, it is easy to think it might be from a spider.  In reality, according the article, many of the wounds are from other kinds of infections and could even be the result of cancer, which would be important to diagnose correctly.

Benzene comes from   coal and petroleum products and is one   of the most commonly made chemicals in the United States.  It is a colorless liquid with a sweet   smell that evaporates when it makes contact with the air.  Benzene   is present in cigarette smoke, car exhausts, and can also be found in glues and   paints, according to the Center   for Disease Control (CDC).  The CDC   Fact Sheet on Benzene says, “Breathing in unusually high doses of   benzene can cause difficulty in thinking, changes in heart function,   unconsciousness, or death. In smaller amounts over longer periods of   time, benzene can also decrease the formation of blood cells. Benzene is   considered to be a cancer-causing chemical.” Exposure   to benzene can come from consuming contaminated food or beverages but   most people come into contact with it by breathing it in the air. The   CDC says, “Benzene gets into the air from forest fires, car emissions,   gasoline vapors, and tobacco smoke. People who work with petroleum   products, including gasoline, are exposed to benzene by touching or   breathing in the chemical.” This warning   might have been sparked by a report from almost decade ago by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research   Organization (CSIRO).  In a December 19, 2001 report , the organization found “high levels of air   toxic emissions in new motor vehicles for up to six months and longer   after they leave the showroom.” That research, however was conducted on   three automobiles manufactured in Australia and one imported vehicle,   the origin of which was not revealed. updated 04/29/10 ","Warnings"

That will automatically send a message to the police that you are in trouble and they will respond to the machine.  The eRumor says that most people don’t know about this. "," The eRumor is false because there isn’t anywhere that we could find where this emergency procedure at ATM machines is actually being used. There is a seed of truth to it, however, in that the idea has been floating around for a while.  One of the biggest proponents has been in Illinois attorney named Joseph Zingher. He says the notion came to him when he was a law student at the University of Illinois and one evening was withdrawing money from an ATM in a scary part of town.  He patented his concept in 1998 and has been trying to talk banks into using it ever since. Under Zingher’s system, every ATM account would have two PIN numbers—the normal PIN used to withdraw money and what he calls the “ATM SafetyPIN” to alert police that something bad was happening at the ATM.  It has also come to be popularly called the “Panic PIN.”  The SafetyPIN would typically be the reverse of the normal PIN number or some other variation that would be easy to remember.  Legislation was passed in Illinois that would allow banks to adopt the system, but did not mandate it.  So far, no banks or financial institutions have done so.  Zingher has offered to let Illinois-based banks to use it for free but some of them have said they think it would be too expensive and that ATM crime is not frequent enough.  Zingher says that ATM crime is much higher than believed because not all crime reporting reflects whether it has taken place in connection with an ATM or forced withdrawal of cash.

"," Several things to consider about this story. 1. It is not true that the “clear” button needs to be pressed to finish the transaction. We checked with the folks at PayPoint, the organization that provides all the ATM machines at Arco stations, which accept only ATM/Debit cards. They confirmed that the transaction is completed as soon as the gas is dispensed and the nozzle is returned to its place on the gas pump. There is no need to press the “clear” button. 2. We have found no evidence that the story in the eRumor is true. This could be a fictionalized account created by someone who has theorized that pressing the “clear” button at an ATM is necessary to finish a transaction. Many eRumors are fabricated from fears based on ignorance. 3. If it is true, there can be more than one explanation for the extra $50 charge including fraud by an employee at the gas station. 4. Some transactions with debit cards for a fill up for an unknown amount will pre-approve a charge of $50 or $75 on a card.  The funds for that pre-approval plus may not be readily available until the end of the business day when all transactions are reconciled by the vendor.

"36 Cities Dump U.S. Dollar for Thomas Edison’s Monetary System- Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bitcoin/"," This is a forwarded email alleging that 36 cities in 20 states in the U.S. have forsaken the dollar and replaced it with a monetary system invented by Thomas Edison in 1922. "," TruthOrFiction.Com has found no evidence of any city in the U.S. dumping the dollar. This appears to be an advertising campaign to raise awareness on Bitcoin and to sell investment newsletter subscriptions .   We found such an ad on the website of political writer and commentator Dick Morris. The source of the rumor is a financial website called Money Map Press who compared the virtual currency Bitcoin to Edison’s monetary concept calling it, “Edison’s Renegade Currency.”   The advertising campaign cleverly used an unproven conspiracy theory claiming that 36 cities are switching to a monetary system based on a monetary concept of a U.S. currency backed by agricultural production of American farmers. The concept was invented by Thomas A. Edison in 1922. Many cities in the US have vendors now accepting Bitcoin for payment. So far, this is just another form of payment, such as cash, check, money order Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover.  In Newport Beach, California a Tesla automobile was purchased by a new owner using Bitcoin.  This according to a December 13, 2013 article by Money Morning.  Other well vendors are jumping on the band wagon as well.   We found a notice on the website of the online electronics vendor > that said Tiger Direct is now accepting Bitcoin.

The quote said, “People are right to fear paper money.” Such a quote may lend credibility to Money Map Press but it may not be a legitimate endorsement by Buffett, who on more than one occasion warned people to steer clear of Bitcoin. Another financial website, who may be partnered with Money Map Press, Money Morning posted a March 17, 2014 article that said Warren Buffett, warned against investing in Bitcoin and called it a “mirage.”   Buffett appeared on CNBC on March 14, 2014 and said, “Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? The idea that [Bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.” Bitcoin is beginning to be recognized by cities and states, according to a January 27, 2014 article by Bloomberg that said New York and California are “preparing to write rules of the road for entrepreneurs driving a surge of interest in Bitcoin.” Is Bitcoin a modern day version of Edison’s monetary concept?

The New York Times reports : “Mr. Feinberg, a Princeton graduate    who began his Wall Street career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk    bond powerhouse of Michael R. Milken fame, got into private equity    in 1992. That year, he and William L. Richter founded    Cerberus, which takes its name from the three-headed dog in Greek    mythology that guards the gates of Hades. Today, Mr. Feinberg presides over a    private empire that rivals some of the mightiest public companies in    the land. Cerberus manages more than $20 billion in capital.    Together, the companies it owns generate annual revenue of about    $40 billion — more than either Amazon or Coca-Cola last year.” Cerberus Capital Management formed the   Freedom Group in 2006, and it has become “the world’s leading innovator,   designer, manufacturer and marketer of firearms, ammunition and related   products,” the company says . Since   then, the Freedom Group has rebranded itself as the Remington Outdoor   Co., so it’s commonly referred to by both names. The Freedom Group has acquired some of   the most recognizable names in the industry: Bushmaster in 2006,   Remington in 2007, DPMS Panther Arms in 2007 and Marlin Firearms in   2008. Cerberus also owned a number of gun and ammo makers before the   Freedom Group was formed. The company’s firearms business quickly earned   more than $1 billion in revenue a year, according to SEC   filings . Claims that Marlin Firearms had “closed   down” went viral in 2011 when the Marlin Firearms manufacturing plant in   Connecticut was shuttered after 141 years in business. A spokesperson   for Remington said the move was made to consolidate manufacturing operations to   cut costs in light of “intense” competition. Bushmaster’s plant in Maine   was also closed in an effort to consolidate manufacturing. But those   brands weren’t discontinued; their products were just rolled into other   manufacturing operations. Reports indicate that the gun and ammo   maker had fallen on hard times by the end of 2012. A Bushmaster gun was   allegedly used to carry out the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary   School in Newtown, Connecticut, and a group of parents later sued the gun maker over the shooting. Remington also faced a $25   million recall of   misfiring guns in 2014. All the while, gun sales had bottomed out.   Buyers flocked to the market in 2013 as stricter federal gun laws were   being debated, so demand for new guns was unusually low with those   buyers off the market a year later, the New York Post reports : “The situation ‘spells disaster’ for    Remington, said a source familiar with the company’s financials. Remington has seen its earnings    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fall from $240    million last year to $125 million this year, the source said.    Revenue has fallen from $1.25 billion last year to $1 billion in    2014. In October, Moody’s Investors Service    downgraded Remington’s debt to B2, or high credit risk. ‘Remington’s weakened financial    condition heightens ongoing rating concerns, including high    regulatory and product liability risks and the discretionary nature    of its products,’ Moody’s wrote.” Cerberus Capital Management has   reportedly been trying to sell the Freedom Group since late 2012. A   Florida company named Global Digital Solutions emerged with a $1 billion   cash offer to purchase the company in early 2014, but Freedom Group   officials later dismissed the bid. In December of 2014,   it was reported that the company had taken on more than $1 billion of debt. updated 02/17/15 ","Warnings"

Version #1: An email from a woman in California who claims that a friend of a friend had an Afghan boyfriend who disappeared shortly before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  She received a letter from him on September 10 begging her not to fly on any commercial airliners on September 11 and to stay away from shopping malls on Halloween. Version #2:  Similar story except that it originates from someone who says the message came from a cousin in Pennsylvania.  That message says the information came in a fax from a brother in Philadelphia whose co-worker dated an Afghan.

Version #6:  The wife of an Afghan receives a letter from her husband saying he loves her and the kids, but that he’s on a mission and will never see them again.  He warns them not to eat at any fast-food restaurants for the next 3 weeks. "," Halloween in 2001 came and went and there was no terrorist activity at malls. Still, this was one of the most widely circulated of the post-September 11 eRumors. No law enforcement authorities found credibility in the rumor and despite massive visibility none of the wives or girlfriends described in the stories surfaced. One interesting aspect of this story was that it produced an unintentional eRumor celebrity. There were many versions of the Halloween scare eRumor, but one of the most widely circulated was one with a person’s name, email address, and office phone number attached.  That person was Laura Katsis in California.  She was listed as an Implementation Specialist for an office of Volt Information Services. She had been told of the warning by a girlfriend of hers and considered it credible. Because she was real and assessable by email and phone, many people considered the eRumor authentic.  Laura did not know the originator of the story, however.  She was one of multitudes of people who was told of it by someone she trusted, thought it was real, and forwarded it.  When an uproar happened at her office because of all the response, her company notified the FBI and gave the message to them.

"E.coli bacteria found in bagged salads?-Truth!","2015-03-17 17:57:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/salads/"," There are a couple of stories about this. One warning says that a documentary on Dateline TV showed that E.coli bacteria were found in pre-packaged bags of salad and that the Dole company has issued a recall on some bags. The other from September of 2006 says the Food and Drug Administration has issued an alert that a strain of E.coli bacterium has been found in several U.S. states and that pre-packaged bags of spinach are suspect. "," Both warnings are true. On September 18, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its warning about spinach, telling consumers not to eat any raw spinach, not just pre-packaged spinach as had initially been announced. The FDA also announced that it’s probe into the sources of spinach contaminated with a strain of E.coli bacterium had been expanded to other companies. On September 15, 2006, the FDA had announced that Natural Selection Foods of San Juan Bautista, California was recalling all of its products that contain spinach that have “best if used by” dates of August 17, 2006 through October 1, 2006 The FDA is continuing to investigate whether any other brands are involved. According to an FDA release, “Natural Selection Foods, LLC brands include: Natural Selection Foods, Pride of San Juan, Earthbound Farm, Bellissima, Dole, Rave Spinach, Emeril, Sysco, O Organic, Fresh Point, River Ranch, Superior, Nature’s Basket, Pro-Mark, Compliments, Trader Joe’s, Ready Pac, Jansal Valley, Cheney Brothers, Coastline, D’Arrigo Brothers, Green Harvest, Mann, Mills Family Farm, Pro*Act, Premium Fresh, Snoboy, The Farmer’s Market, Tanimura & Antle, President’s Choice, Cross Valley, and Riverside Farms. These products include spinach and any salad with spinach in a blend, both retail and food service products. Products that do not contain spinach are not part of this recall.” The FDA said that 109 cases of illness had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control including one death and 14 cases of what is called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a form of kidney failure. States included in the warning include: California, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The FDA said the affected products were also distributed to Canada and Mexico. The other story was focused on Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The Dateline show aired in April, 2006. When more than 10 cases of sick people with similar symptoms showed up within three days in September, 2005, a public health investigation was launched.  The Minnesota Department of Public Health speculated that the sicknesses were food-related. One of the investigators suspected E.coli because of the symptoms of abdominal cramps and severe, bloody diarrhea.  The problem was that E.coli poisoning was more commonly associated with eating contaminated and improperly cooked meat.  One of the foods that most of the sick people had eaten was salads made from bagged lettuce. When a public health warning was issued about the salads, one of the victims called investigators from his hospital room and said he still had a partially-eaten bag in his refrigerator.  That lettuce was tested and became the first evidence that the E.coli had come from the pre-packaged salads.  The odd thing was that the bacterium was found in the lettuce, not just on it. As a result of that 2005 outbreak, the Dole company issued a voluntary recall for the “American Blend” and “Classic Romaine” packaged salads.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also issued a nationwide health alert in October, 2005, about the particular Dole salads implicated in the outbreak. According to Dateline, 26 people from three states got ill, some of them seriously.  There were no known deaths and there have not been any repeats of the problem. Updated 9/18/06 ","Warnings"

The player is on a mission to photograph specific styles and colors of panties worn by supermodels to satisfy three testosterone-driven aliens and keep them from blowing up the Earth. One day on a planet far, far away, a catalog from a famous lingerie store inexplicably showed up in the mailbox at one horny alien’s home. Some time later, he and his two buddies had worn out the catalog and they needed more! So they hijacked a flying saucer for a joy ride across the universe in search of supermodels in their underwear. The player assumes the role of “Nelson,” an innocent bystander who is forced to help the aliens in their perverted quest. Nelson’s job is to photograph specific models, wearing specific types and colors of underwear (as specified by the aliens). If Nelson does not get the photos that the aliens are asking for, in the amount of time given, the aliens will destroy Earth. Once on the island, Nelson can use all the tools available to him: * Pick up lines – Use cheesy pickup lines to lure models out of the woods. * X-Ray glasses – You know the ones seen in the back of comic books? These actually work – allowing the player to see what kind of underwear each girl is wearing, before they go through the process of undressing her. Keep in mind if you waste too much time undressing a supermodel.BOOM! Earth will be destroyed can you control yourself? * Lures – Items such as tiny mints (lunch!) and credit cards. No self-respecting supermodel can resist these items. * Camera – Once the correct model is found wearing the right panties, and the outer clothing has been removed, it’s time to use the camera to photograph the model. These photos are then added to the player’s inventory. If all the correct models in the correct lingerie are photographed within the given amount of time, Earth is saved. Otherwise, the frustrated aliens are forced to take their hormone driven anger out on the planet. Last updated 11/13/00 For more information: Simon and Schuster News Release ","Warnings"

"," This       has been a complex one to try to track down and we’ve consulted a       number of different sources.  Here is our best understanding of       the truth: …As the millions of people who heat water in the microwave for       coffee and tea can attest, this is not a common occurrence and we       could find no record of injuries from it, although that doesn’t mean       none has happened. …When water is heated on a stove and reaches the boiling point,       there are usually the characteristic bubbles that emerge from the       bottom of the heated pan.  It would be easy, then, to think       that all water boils like that when reaching the boiling       point.  The problem is, that’s not always the case. … It is possible to       sometimes heat water beyond the boiling point but without the       bubbles.   Why are there no       bubbles?  When water reaches the boiling point, the water       molecules need to start joining arms with other water molecules in       order to create the bubble of vapor that we see as boiling.  In       order to do that, some molecules need to all meet together at the       same place and at the same time at what is called a “nucleation       site.”   A nucleation site can be a tiny impurity,       another air bubble, even a scratch on the surface of the       container. …So, here’s the scenario:  Some water is heated in the       microwave and both the water and the container are clean enough that       there are no nucleation sites.  The water temperature goes       higher than the boiling point, but without       “boiling.”  Not only that, but because of the way       microwaves work, not all of the water in the cup is the same       temperature.  The water lining the sides of the cup becomes       heated, while some of the water toward the interior of the cup       is cooler.

"List of Facts and Figures about Illegal Immigration-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-aliens/"," The eRumor claims to have a list of alarming facts about Illegal immigration. "," Illegal immigration is a significant issue for Americans and deserves attention, but whoever authored this eRumor did not help his or her cause.  Most of the figures are either difficult to prove or don’t match known facts.  Some seem to be fabricated. A couple actually proved their point even better than the statistics quoted. Some versions say the figures are from the Los Angeles Times (which is not true).  Others say they are statistics from the FBI (which is not true either). One of the challenges with this topic is that illegal immigrants are somewhat invisible to statistics.  They are living underground and the best figures about illegal immigrants are mostly based on deductions from those who are either in professional positions working with immigrant issues or doing research on immigration.  None of the estimates should be considered the last word on illegal immigration and the figures we found sometimes varied widely. Here is our research on each of the points of the email: 1. 40% of all workers in L.A. County (L.A. County has 10.2 million people) Fiction! Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles issued a report in 2005 on what it called “L.A’s Off-The-Books labor force.”  Its research was about the city of Los Angeles, not the entire county, and concluded that there were 3,908,000 wage earners in the city and about 972,000 “informal workers,” meaning they were getting paid under the table.  It does not break down how many of them might have been illegal aliens, but the percentage was no where near 40 percent.  Los Angeles Almanac estimated number of “unreported jobs” in 2005 in Los Angeles County at 643,000 with a number of workers at 4,090.630. 2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens- Mostly Truth! The most commonly quoted source for this is a report by Heather McDonald and published by the Center for Immigration Studies.  She repeated her research on April 13, 2005 in testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on “Immigration, Border Security, and Claims” saying that 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide in Los Angeles targeted illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens- Unproven! We could not find anything to substantiate this.  If you browse through the Most Wanted list for the Los Angeles Police Department there are a lot of foreign-born listed, but not how many of them may be illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers- Inaccurate! According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, about half the births in Los Angeles County in 2004 were to undocumented women.  In 1989 California required by law that the state  Medi-Cal program be available to pregnant women living in poverty. 5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally- Fiction! National statistics would tend to suggest that this claim is not true.  A 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center said that among men 18-39, which represents the majority of prison inmates, the incarceration rate of foreign born was 0.7 percent while the incarceration rate of native born was 3.5 percent.   Foreign born Mexicans had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent in 2000 compared with 5.9 percent for native born men of Mexican descent.  The report did not say how many of the foreign born were illegal.  A 1993 report to the California Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations estimated that more than 15 percent of the 116,000 state prison inmates were illegal aliens.  In her congressional testimony (referenced above), Heather McDonald said that the L.A. County Sheriff reported in 2000 that 23% of inmates in county jails were deportable, according to the New York Times.  That’s all inmates, however, not just Mexicans. 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages- Unproven! It is known that large numbers of illegal immigrants are crammed into houses and apartments that are too small for the number of people living in them and that others are living in garages, but we could not find anyone who kept statistics on garage-dwellers or how anybody would know their numbers. 7. The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border- Unproven! It is known that gangs do include illegal aliens but coming up with a reliable statistic would be difficult.  Again, the gangs operate underground. 8. Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal- Unproven! 9. 21 radio stations in L.A. are Spanish speaking- Mostly Truth! As the Spanish-speaking population of Los Angeles has grown so has the presence of Spanish-speaking media.  We counted about 18 stations in Los Angeles that are either Spanish or are multi-cultural and include Spanish in their music or programming.  At this writing, four of the top ten stations in Los Angeles are Spanish and the number-one station is usually Spanish. 10. In L.A. County 5.1 million people speak English. 3.9 million speak Spanish. (There are 10.2 million people in L.A. County )- Inaccurate But the Real Figures Support the Point! The U.S.Census Bureau reported that as of 2004, 3.9 million people in L.A.County spoke only English at home; 3.7 million spoke primarily Spanish at home. 11. Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare- Fiction! The U.S. department of Labor said that the number of farm workers who were undocumented in 1998-1998 was 52% . Regarding welfare, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for welfare except for elementary and high school education and emergency medical care.  Children born in the U.S. are citizens and qualify for certain public assistance.

"Gang members hiding in the back seats of cars to kidnap women-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gangkidnap/"," A warning is being issued by police in major cities about gang members who are kidnapping women to rape or kill.  It’s part of a gang initiation ritual and the gang members are hiding in the back seats of women’s cars.  The story came to light when a gas station attendant spotted a man in the rear seat of a car, warned the woman and called police. "," No such threat has been documented and for most of the time this eRumor has circulated, there has never been any substantiation of any law enforcement agency issuing such a warning or even reporting such a story involving gangs or initiations. In September, 2007, however, police in Decatur, Alabama, said they had a report of an event that was similar.  According to the Decatur Daily News, a 23-year-old woman said that she ended up with a would-be kidnapper in the back seat of her SUV.  She said that she had just completed an evening college class and was talking on the phone while driving away from the campus.  A man sat up in the back seat and said he wanted her to take him somewhere.  As he started climbing over the seat into the front of the SUV, she slammed on her brakes, put the car in park, and got out.  The man grabbed a pack of cigarettes, got out of the car, and walked away.  The driver said he appeared to have had a gun.  She said she had locked her car while attending the college class and theorized that the man had actually gotten into her car when she stopped at a grocery store earlier in the evening. One of our staff members here at TruthOrFiction.com remembers dealing with this story in Los Angeles in the early 1970’s.  It’s gone through various versions, but always includes a menacing man in the back seat spotted by an alert gas station attendant.  Some stories say it’s a gang member who is going to kidnap and rape the woman.  Others say it’s a serial killer.  Others say the gang members are supposed to kill the woman and take one body part or another as a part of an initiation.

Even ordinary chlorine needs to be used with caution and the labels on the products need to be read and any warnings heeded. Does Ultra Clorox contain sodium hydroxide (lye)?  According to Clorox, yes…and so does every other bleach on the market.  It is generally less than 1 percent of the volume.  Contrary to the claim in the eRumor, sodium hydroxide is not “added” to the chlorine to make it work faster.  It is a natural byproduct of the process of making chlorine, according to Clorox.

Visits to doctors don’t provide relief.  At one point, the woman discovers that fibers from the tampon have been accumulating in her vagina.  The email postulates that the fiber mass was both causing the problems and preventing doctors from finding the cause.  It says the lady is thinking about filing a lawsuit and fearing Toxic Shock Syndrome. "," According to the folks at Procter and Gamble, the maker of the Tampax Pearl tampons, this email was started by a woman who claims she was relating the experience of a friend of hers, but the woman has refused to reveal her friend’s identity so the story is without substantiation. If the story is not true, then it is a fabrication and probably came from the fears and imagination of a person who felt discomfort about the Tampax Pearl tampons and wanted to create a story that gave substance to her warnings. The fears may have been based on genuine concerns about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which can be fatal. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the number of TSS cases in recent years has been less than a dozen each year, some of which have been associated with the use of tampons, especially among young women. TSS has also occurred, however, in children, men, and non-menstruating women. The FDA says a connection between TSS and some types of Tampons has been suggested, especially associated with materials that are no longer used in Tampons in the United States. An FDA report says, “Vaginal dryness and ulcerations may occur when women use tampons more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Ulcerations have also been reported in women using tampons between menstrual periods to try to control excessive vaginal discharge or abnormal bleeding. Women may avoid problems by choosing a tampon with the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow and using tampons only during active menstruation.” For more information, CLICK HERE for the FDA page on tampons.

"," According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA), all firms that use phenylpropanolamine in their products are being asked to voluntarily discontinue them. The suggestion from the eRumor that there are refunds on the products is a hoax. Phenylpropanolamine is commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter nasal decongestants and weight control products. The FDA action was in response to a study by researchers at Yale University that found an increased risk of stroke in people who were using products with phenylpropanolamine in them. The FDA says the chance of stroke is small and was found to have mostly affected women, but because of the seriousness of stroke and the difficulty in predicting who could be at risk, it was best to ask for the manufacturers to voluntarily remove it.

"Poinsettia plants are poison to children and pets-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/poinsettias/"," It’s common around Christmas time for people to warn one another about the alleged toxicity of poinsettias. "," This is one of those beliefs that is so widespread that a survey of       florists found that most of them believed it to be true. That’s       because it has been the conventional understanding about poinsettias       for many years. The consensus of government agencies, health centers, veterinary       groups, and plant and       flower organizations that we’ve surveyed, however, is that poinsettias are not       toxic and do not pose a health threat to children or pets. The belief in poinsettia poison appears to extend back to 1919 when       the two-year-old child of a U.S. Army officer died.  It was       believed that the death was caused by the child ingesting poinsettia       leaves.  The American Society of Florists has looked into the       matter extensively and says there was never any proof that       poinsettia leaves were responsible for the child’s death and the       report was later determined to be hearsay. The America Society of Florists joined with researchers at Ohio       State University to test various parts of the poinsettia plant on       rats.  Their conclusion was that there was no toxicity or any       other side effects even when the rats were given large       doses. POISENDEX is the source of poison information for the majority of poison       control centers.  It says that a 50-pound child would have to       eat more than a pound-and-a-quarter of poinsettia leaves to exceed       the doses used in the Ohio State research, which would be 500 to 600       leaves. The American Society of Florists says no other consumer plant has       been tested for toxicity more than the poinsettia. The ASPCA Animal Poison Center in Urbana, Illinois says it regards       poinsettias as having such low toxicity risk that it doesn’t even       recommend decontaminating animals that may have ingested them.        The center says that there can sometimes be gastrointestinal       distress from having ingested something alien to the digestive       system. The American Veterinary       Medicine Association of America (AVMA), doesn’t include poinsettias       on its list of plants that are a threat to animals. Because of the belief that poinsettias are toxic, there are numerous       visits to hospitals each year by concerned parents or pet owners whose children       or pet have ingested or in some other way been exposed to       poinsettias. A study released in 2000 by Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and       Carnegie Mellon University found that out of nearly 23,000       poinsettia exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide,       there was essentially no toxicity of significance of any kind.

"Progesterex-the new date-rape drug-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/progesterex/",".gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;} (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Progesterex: A New Date Rape Drug- Fiction! Summary of story: Ladies are warned to be cautious when offered a drink by a guy.  It may contain a new animal sterilization drug called Progesterex.  It is allegedly being used, along with the well known date-rape drug Rohypnol, to disable a woman and she doesn’t wake up until the next morning and doesn’t remember anything about what happened.  Further, the story says that the drug permanently sterilizes any woman who takes it. "," The    experts are saying it’s a hoax, a fabricated story.  We’ve checked    with several sources for veterinary medicines and veterinary training    schools and none of them has ever heard of Progesterex.  The Food and    Drug Administration, which regulates medications for both humans and    animals, has no knowledge of it.  The other drug mentioned, Rohypnol,    does exist and has the reputation of being a date-rape drug.     According to the FDA, it’s not legal in the United States but is used in    Europe as, among other things, a sedative.  The FDA says it not only    induces sleep, but those who have taken it frequently cannot remember    anything that happened while they were under the influence of the    drug. A real example of the story as it has    been circulated: Ladies, be more alert and cautious when getting a drink offer from a guy.    Good guys out there, please forward this message to your lady friends.    Andboyfriends,take heed. There is a new drug that has been out for less    than a year. Progesterex,that is a essentially a small steriliziation pill. The drug is    now being used by rapists at parties to rape AND sterilize their victims.    Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals. Rumour has it    that the Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape    drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girls    drink. The girl cant remember a thing the next morning, of all that had    taken place the night before. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the    victim doesnt conceive from the rape and the rapist neednt worry    about having a paternity test identifying him months later. The drugs effects ARENT TEMPORARY. Progesterex was designed to    sterilize horses. Any female that takes it WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE.    The crooks can get this drug from anyone who is in the vet school of any    university. Its that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses    everywhere. Believe it or not, there is even a site on the internet    telling people how to use it. Please forward this to everyone you know,    especially the gals. ","Warnings"
"Perfume peddlers using ether to knock people out and rob them-Was Fiction!  Now a copycat incident may have taken place!","2015-03-16 17:08:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/perfume/"," The author says he or she was approached in a public place, such as a mall or on the street, and offered the chance to sample some perfume fragrances.  The author declined, then later learned that robbers are using that method to disable people with a whiff of ether then robbing them while they are unconscious. "," This eRumor circulated on the Internet from the late 1990’s to 2008    with no documented cases of perfume crooks being reported. S everal different versions    said that these events had happened in various cities in the United    States. Medical experts (as well as the many people who were anesthetized in the    old days with ether) say one hit of ether is not enough to knock someone    out. Then in July, 2008, a woman was arrested in Houma, Louisiana and charged    with battery and unlawful solicitation in a scheme that sounded very much    like the eRumor. The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s office said that the 22-year old woman    approached a man in a parking lot outside a video store and asked if he    wanted to buy some perfume.  She then sprayed him with the stuff and    the victim said the fumes left him feeling light-headed and irritated his    skin and that he had to go to the emergency room for treatment.     Houma police then discovered that the same woman had approached an 18-year    old a month earlier with the same offer and had given him a whiff of the    alleged perfume.  He later returned to work and passed out.  He    was given tests at a hospital for symptoms including dizziness, shortness    of breath, and numbness in his extremities.  Officials never found    out what the woman had in the bottles but she was arrested by a state    trooper who spotted her after a police broadcast of the description of her    car.  There were three men in the car with her who said they sold    perfume in New Orleans all the time. There was also a report of a similar incident by Police in    Mobile, Alabama in 1999, although it was never proven that it was    perpetrated by a crook.  Officers said that 54 year old Bertha Johnson told them that she was knocked out and robbed by someone who had her sample a fragrance.     An article in the Mobile Register newspaper from November 11, 1999, quoted    Johnson as saying the woman claimed she was selling cologne.  After    one whiff, Johnson said she passed out and awoke to discover that she and    her car were no longer in the parking lot of the bank, she had a splitting    headache, and $800 was missing from her purse, including some money she    was depositing for her employer.  Johnson is having to battle    skeptics who believe she invented the story and took the money herself.     No evidence has been found to substantiate what she alleged.

"Take action by July 1 to prevent your personal information from being sold by financial institutions-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/opt-out/"," An email warning says you need to take personal action by July 1 to keep your name from being sold to mailing lists by some of the companies you do business with.  Some versions say that otherwise, the companies can “give the information to anyone who asks.”   They also list telephone numbers you can call to accomplish the same thing with credit bureaus. "," Go get a cup of coffee to drink while reading this, because this one is confusing. First, don’t worry about the July 1 deadline.  It actually referred to July 1, 2001, and it wasn’t a deadline for you.  It was a deadline for certain financial institutions to notify you of “opt-out” policies (explained below).  You haven’t missed out on anything. Second, most version of this eRumor say that if you don’t respond, anybody who asks will be given your personal information including your Social Security number.  That is not true. Here are the details. As you have discovered, it is common for people with whom you have done business to put you on their mailing lists and for them to send you information from time to time about themselves.  They’re looking for additional business from you. It is also true that many of those companies will make your name, address, and other information about you available to other companies so those companies can send you information about themselves, their products, and their services.  Sometimes that information is sold to other companies.  Sometimes it is shared among companies that have the same ownership or other alliances. A lot of people objected to this company-to-company sharing of personal  information so in response, Congress passed The Financial Services Modernization Act, also known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB).  It required financial institutions such as banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, or brokerage firms to notify their customers by July 1, 2001 of their policies regarding what is done with information about them…and to give the chance to “opt out” of the process.  In other words, to to give you the chance to tell those institutions that you do not want your information shared or sold to anyone else.  It did not mean that if you failed to respond by July 1 you were out of luck.  You can request privacy information at any time from any company and ask about whether you can opt-out and, if so, how. In a completely separate and previous action in 1996, Congress also passed an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  This one applied to credit bureaus, those companies that keep track of your credit information.  The amendment required them to give customers an opportunity to “opt-out” if they didn’t want their information shared with other companies who may want to solicit them for business.  That’s where the telephone number came from and it is authentic.  If you dial (888) 567-8688, that will accomplish your opt-out request with the top four major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, Trans-union, and Innovis. To make things more confusing, if you call the number, there is a recording that explains that some of the information in the eRumors is incorrect and some people have thought that means the number is bogus. We do urge caution.  Before you call any of the telephone numbers in an email, make sure they are correct. (See the links below).  You will be asked to share personal information such as your Social Security number and you don’t want to give it to anyone who many have inserted a bogus phone number into the email.

Her    understanding of pharmacology and metabolism is largely    incorrect”.  He concludes by saying, “…, this series of    allegations by MS. Markle are almost totally without foundation. They are    rabidly inaccurate and scandalously misinformative.” 4.  The American Diabetes Association says it “…recognizes    that there is no credible scientific evidence linking aspartame to any    health-related problems for people with diabetes.” and that    “…aspartame–as well as the other FDA-approved nonnutritive    sweeteners saccharin, acesulfame K, and sucralose–acceptable sugar    substitutes and a safe part of a diabetic meal plan.” http://www.diabetes.org/community/info_news/news/aspartame.jsp 5.  The official NutraSweet website has a response to    the email at http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/search.asp?Id=61&srch=danger .

Some of the description in this email does not seem credible.  Whether a fire melted a smoke alarm or not is not relevant because any hot room fire can melt the typical home smoke alarm.  The alarm is not intended to survive a fire, but to warn of one ahead of time.  Also, it is possible to blow up a toilet by putting something explosive into it, but whether a gas escaping from a candle would accomplish that is questionable. Even if the gas was heavier than air, what would ignite it in the toilet? Gel candles have been in the news, however.  There was a voluntary recall in 1998 of hardened gel candles from GLADE by the S.C. Johnson & Son company, of Racine, Wisconsin.  According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, some of the candles could burn with a flame higher than normal, as much as 3 inches above the container.  At the time the recall was announced, the CPSC said there had not been any reports of damage or injuries. There is at least one recall by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission involving candles with breaking or “exploding” glass, but not in connection with gel candles. That was with regard to a more conventional wax candle. There are numerous warnings around the country from various consumer protection organizations and fire departments about the dangers of using ordinary candles around the house.  The National Fire Protection Association says that during 1997, there were more than 11,000 candle-related fires in the United States, including several fatalities.

"Islam in California Schools-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/byronislam/"," The message says “Public Schools Embrace Islam – A Shocker.”  It focuses on seventh graders in Byron, California, and says that although students in a growing number of public schools cannot wear crosses or utter the name of Jesus, they are being required to attend an intensive three-week course on Islam including mandated study of the tenets of Islam, the important people of Islam, wearing of a robe, adopting a Moslem name, and staging their own Jihad.  It says that the California-required course uses a textbook that says a lot more about Islam than about Christianity and quotes a teacher who says she couldn’t teach Christianity like that and can’t even say the name of Jesus in the classroom, but the seventh graders are learning how to pray to Allah. "," This eRumor has been explosive, both in terms of how quickly it grew in circulation on the Internet and the reaction it prompted. It is based on an article written for the ASSIST News Service by Austin Miles, who is described as a chaplain, author, historian, speaker, educator, and veteran master of ceremonies at various events around the country (he was a circus ringmaster). Highlighting concerns over activities in a class about Islam in Excelsior Middle School, the article suggests that the State of California has “embraced Islam,” that a course on Islam has been “stealthily” slipped into the seventh grade statewide, that the course is mandated as are activities such as wearing Islamic garb, adopting a Moslem name, and stating their own Jihad.  The article also leaves the impression that students and teachers are not allowed to utter the name of Jesus in a classroom and that students cannot wear crosses. Miles interviewed Christina Lemings, a parent of a seventh grader who is also a seventh grade teacher in the Byron Union School District in Contra Costa County, in Northern California.  She said that she did not know what was being taught in the class on Islam until her son brought home a flyer from the Excelsior School about it.  She told Miles, “they teach Islam as the true religion, and students are taught about Islam and to pray to Allah.”  The article says she has quickly learned that in public school, God and Christianity are out (forbidden) but that Islam is in. At question is what actually happened in the classes about Islam at Excelsior school and to what extent, as the article suggests, are these activities mandated statewide? If the children were taught to pray to Allah or to participate in any other Islamic devotional activities, that is an outrage deserving of the protest of parents and other concerned Californians. Lemings says there was prayer to Allah in the class.  Other news reports have said that the children were required to pray “in the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful” and to stage their own Jihad.  Nancie Castro, the principle at the middle school, denies the children were taught to pray or that any of the children was required to participate in the cultural activities of wearing Middle-Eastern clothing or choosing a Moslem name. She told the Contra Costa Times that wearing the clothing was something offered for extra credit. The American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia has written a letter to the Byron School district demanding that parents be given the chance to choose whether their children participate in the required course on Islam. Castro says that  when the flyers about the course were sent to parents, three families asked that their children be exempted from that particular portion of the studies and they were given alternate assignments. Peggy Green, the Superintendent of the Byron Union School district says that the school is merely reflecting the California guidelines for seventh grade and that the students are learning about Islam in the same way that they learn about Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and other major religions.  She says that individual teachers will augment the curriculum with various activities and games, including dressing-up and role playing, in order to stimulate class discussion.  Green did not specifically say whether there had been prayers to Allah or any other devotional activities encouraged by the teacher at Byron.  Green says she and her staff have been fielding calls and other messages to the school about the controversy, many of which have been malignant and threatening. Lemings, the teacher interviewed by Miles, says she has been troubled by the nature and content of some of the complaints to the school and issued a statement on January 15 saying, “Our schools have wonderful people teaching our children who are walking a fine line trying to comply with their state’s regulations, a vague understanding of the separation of church and state and the possibility of a lawsuit on any given day.”  She said she heard some of the recorded messages directed at her principal and school and was ashamed of them and reminded people that the protest was against decisions at the state level and that her concern was over the way the textbook had handled these issues. Educators with whom TruthOrFiction.com has spoken, however,  say that they feel that the article sensationalized the issue and included some misinformation.  It left the impression that this new class on Islam had been “slipped” into California public schools and that the state was mandating activities such as had been described as happening in the Byron School District. Forrest Turpen is  the Executive Director of the Christian Educator’s Association International (www.ceai.org).  It is a Christian group committed to educators and educational issues in public schools.  Turpin says the teaching about Islam has not been “slipped” into the curriculum.  Islam has been an important part of history, and therefore an important part of studying history for a long time and is a part of the state guidelines for seventh graders just as teaching about Christianity is a part of the educational guidelines for 6th graders.  That is the reason, according to Turpin, why the textbook “Across the Centuries” deals with Islam more than Christianity.  It’s a seventh grade text and that is the grade when Islam is studied. “In fact,” says Turpin, “the state of California has been a leader in requiring a balance of teaching about who we are and what has empowered us as a civilization.” Tom Adams, the administrator for curriculum framework at the state education department, told the Contra Costa Times that state guidelines (for seventh grade) do include a unit on Islamic civilization in the medieval world, however, it should be an academic approach on the historical significance of the religion. It should not be construed as an endorsement of it. How the guidelines are implemented in the classroom is largely up to the teacher and critics say that in many classrooms, Islam has been emphasized while other religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, have sometimes been hardly touched upon.  In an article on WorldNetDaily.com, Diana Lynne said that other parents in California have reported Islam-related activities that have caused them concern.  One parent says her daughter was indoctrinated about Islam for four months while in seventh grade in Elk Grove, California.  She said one day, she arrived at school to find a banner in front that said “There is one God, Allah, and Mohammad is his prophet.”   She says she had also seen children chanting from the Koran and praying. TruthOrFiction.com also reviewed the portions of the textbook “Across the Centuries” that deal with Islam.  The text does present Islam in a positive way, which critics say ignores some of the aspects of Islamic history that aren’t so positive, especially violent conquest. Another complaint about the text is that it treats the claims of Islam as “fact.”  TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed the disputed passages and found that most of them, with a couple of exceptions, are attributed in some way to Moslem belief, rather than stated fact.  Several of the disputed passages that are being passed around the Internet are from a section in the text that is under the umbrella title “The Teachings of Islam.”  Many of the sentences in that section have no attribution because they are already being presented as Islamic belief. There is protest from some parents about the suggested student activities in the textbook such as imaging being a Muslim soldier on the way to conquer Syria and journaling thoughts about Islam and being in battle; building a miniature mosque as a class activity; writing about a journey to Mecca; Contemplating why Islam was so attractive to Arabs and others in Southwest Asia.  One veteran teacher told TruthOrFiction.com, however, that those kinds of suggested activities are commonly used by teachers and that he doesn’t view them as being in the book in order to favor Islam.  He said that there are similar suggestions in the sixth grade textbook including having the students discuss what role the Israelite’s relationship with God played in the formation of their nation, explaining the covenant that the Israelites made with God, imagining being with the Jews when they were conquered by the Babylonians and forced into exile, discussing how Judaism and Christianity are related, how the teachings of Jesus were similar or different from those of other Jews, and doing a presentation of the differences of the religious views of the Sadducees and the Pharisees.

"Breast cancer can be caused by underarm antiperspirants-Disputed!","2015-03-16 17:08:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/breastcancer/"," An email claims that the use of antiperspirants is the leading cause of breast cancer.  The theory is that toxins are released by sweat, especially under the arms, and antiperspirants are blocking the release of the toxins, allowing them to build up, and the result is cancer.  It also claims that nearly all breast cancers are in the upper, outside quadrant of the breast, near the armpits. "," According to the American Cancer Society and several other respected medical authorities, the use of antiperspirant does not cause cancer.  Additionally, sweating is not the prime way the body gets rid of toxins, so even if the pores under the arms were clogged, that would not doom the body to an accumulation of cancer-threatening build-ups.   According to the American Cancer Society, the upper, outside quadrant is not the site of “nearly all” of breast cancers, but about half that.
