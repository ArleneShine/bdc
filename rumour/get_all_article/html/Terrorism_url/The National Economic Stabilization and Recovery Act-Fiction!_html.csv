Gov. Debt Forgiveness in Calif. DUE All U.S.         Citizens!<br />         This debt forgiveness and new money system will eventually flow         worldwide.<br />         &#8220;Two days later on September 11, 2001, at 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight         Time, Alan Greenspan, was scheduled to announce the new Treasury Bank         system, DEBT FORGIVENESS for all U.S. citizens, and abolishment of the         IRS as the first part of the public announcements of NESARA.<br />         Instead, at just before and after 9 a.m. EDT, planes attacked the World         Trade Center. The attack on the WTC served to stop the announcement of         NESARA because a crucial banking computer center on the first and second         floors of the WTC was prevented from carrying out a computer system         download to U.S. banks which was scheduled to begin at 9 A.M. EDT.&#8221;<br />         All citizens of the United States have great financial benefits OVERDUE         to them. I&#8217;m BREAKING the SILENCE and BLACKOUT on the TRUTH about why         some people in Orange County, California have MORE CASH in their hands         this last month! I&#8217;m breaking the BLACKOUT because our PEOPLE NEED the         economic boost that is ALREADY DUE to Americans! Could you use more         money? U.S. households and citizens HAVE a significant disposable INCOME         INCREASE DUE to them RIGHT NOW. A 15 minute announcement out of         Washington, D.C. is ALL it takes! MASSIVE personal debt forgiveness and         abolishment of federal income tax are OVERDUE to EVERY citizen of the         United States! Mainstream media has cooperated in the blackout on this         historic news, but the blackout has helped stop these benefits from         reaching us. It&#8217;s time to end the blackout and demand our benefits.<br />         For the last month in Orange County California, citizens have been         receiving letters enabling them to have ALL their credit card debts         forgiven and their mortgage debt taken off their shoulders. If their         mortgage was taken out before 1997, it is totally &#8220;forgiven&#8221;         and the DEED to the property will be mailed out to the owner. If the         mortgage was taken out during 1997 or later, the mortgage bank is         required to turn it into a &#8220;self-liquidating loan&#8221; which the         BANKS are required to pay off on behalf of the citizens. Some lucky         people in Orange County are receiving these benefits of NESARA which         EVERY citizen in the United States is SUPPOSED to have ALREADY RECEIVED!         My research indicates that the average household in the U.S. has credit         card debt of $8,123 which generally requires minimum payments of         $150-200 per month. The average mortgage payment is roughly $770 per         month per my research. According to year 2000 Census data, the median         income for Americans under 65 is $33,766 and at just 10% income tax,         monthly income tax deductions average $281 per month.<br />         The total ADDITIONAL CASH in hand for a typical American due to NESARA         debt forgiveness and income tax abolishment computes to approximately         $1,200 PER MONTH! Depending on your credit card payments and if you have         a two-income household, your ADDITIONAL CASH in hand per month could be         higher! NESARA is a secret law passed in March 2000, and signed by         Clinton on October 10, 2000.<br />         My sources have personal contact with people directly involved in         processing these debt forgiveness activities to which EVERY citizen in         the United States IS ENTITLED and should have received MONTHS ago! The         people doing the debt forgiveness processing have been working long         hours to process all the citizens who have been receiving these debt         forgiveness letters in the last month. Other sources have told us that         the banks and mortgage companies were ordered in June 2001 to print up         DEEDS in preparation for the mass debt forgiveness of all pre-1997         mortgages and the sending of DEEDS to their customers. These DEEDS,         already printed and waiting to be sent, have been sitting on shelves         since June 2001, waiting for the formal public announcement of NESARA.         The people of Orange County have been designated a &#8220;demonstration         project&#8221; and are receiving their debt forgiveness letters under         that authority.<br />         Before you worry about what funds the federal government will run on,         let me explain that the federal government pays ALL its expenses out of         other funds and has been doing so for years. After NESARA&#8217;s         announcement, this information will be made public. The IRS was always         just a &#8220;financial gestapo&#8221; used by the federal government         against Americans. This is only a SMALL part of the HUGE FRAUD         perpetrated on the people of the United States; fraud which NESARA ends.<br />         You can also rest assured that the banks are going to do well under         NESARA which ends the exorbitant unconstitutional interest rates and         other abuses by banks. The banks are receiving a flat fee of $4,000 per         credit card account when they zero out the credit card accounts and         that&#8217;s why they have been busy trying to entice people to open more         credit card accounts in the last few years. The banks ALSO have a new         LUCRATIVE, sophisticated way to make the money needed to pay off and         zero out the mortgage balances.<br />         Corrupt politicians in D.C. have continually delayed the formal         announcement of NESARA. There is a struggle currently in the federal         government between those who are legally appointed to get NESARA         announced and the corrupt entrenched politicians and officials trying to         stop NESARA. Let me explain the history of NESARA so you understand.<br />         The story of exposing the federal government&#8217;s fraud begins in 1970&#8217;s         with banks foreclosing on family-run farms all over the United States.         We all have heard of Willie Nelson&#8217;s Farm Aid Concerts which began many         years ago to aid farmers in saving their farms. The farm foreclosures         were devastating and some of the farmers realized there was something         fishy about the farm mortgage foreclosures.<br />         The Farmers Union did some in-depth research and found evidence of         blatant illegalities including that the banks were charging exorbitant         and illegal amounts of interest! What the Farmers Union found was that         the bankers were, in many cases, ILLEGALLY foreclosing on their farms!         When the Farmers Union attempted to obtain help from the federal         government to stop the illegal foreclosures, the farmers discovered         GOVERNMENT COLLUSION with the illegal foreclosures. The Farmers Union         launched class action lawsuits against the banks and the federal         government.<br />         The Farmers Union lawsuits began in 1970&#8217;s and continued going up and         down the state and federal courts finally reaching the U.S. Supreme         Court. In 1993, an ex-CIA agent, who had kept records proving illegal         banking practices and government collusion, testified in the U.S.         Supreme Court in support of the Farmers Union lawsuit. Faced with the         irrefutable PROOF of banking illegalities, in 1993 the U.S.<br />         Supreme Court ruled that the Farmers Union claims were VALID and that         the U.S. federal government and the banks had seriously defrauded the         farmers, and all U.S. citizens, out of vast sums of money and property.<br />         The farmers were awarded damages and, in fact, the U.S. Supreme Court         required that other citizens of the U.S. be given the opportunity to         file for damages against the U.S. federal government in a process called         &#8220;Farm Claims&#8221;. Upon realizing that all<br />         citizens, in addition to farmers, had been defrauded, the damages         process name was changed to Bank Claims. From 1993 through 1996, U.S.         citizens filed Bank Claims against the banks and the federal government         through the U.S. Treasury Department to obtain payment for the damages         as specified by the U.S. Supreme Court. (This process CLOSED in 1996.) I         hope I have your attention because I&#8217;m told the BENEFITS of NESARA are         EVEN GREATER than debt forgiveness and income taxes abolishement. That&#8217;s         why there&#8217;s been such a battle to try to keep NESARA from being fully         implemented. I&#8217;m told there is ANOTHER process which will enable all         remaining U.S. citizens who missed the Bank Claims process to file for         substantial compensation AFTER the announcement of NESARA. This will be         announced publicly to everyone after NESARA is implemented.<br />         In the 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the Court specified that in         addition to paying damages to farmers and Farm/Bank Claims claimants,         sweeping changes were REQUIRED to eradicate the deeply entrenched FRAUD         in the federal government. These SWEEPING changes included: 1)         abolishing the illegal and unconstitutional IRS income taxes; 2) setting         up a Treasury bank system to replace the Federal Reserve and absorbing         the Federal Reserve facilities and personnel into the Department of the         Treasury after purchasing all the private shares and facilities of the         Federal Reserve; 3) instituting new Treasury currency backed by precious         metals in alignment with a worldwide return to currency backed by gold         and other precious metals; 4) providing debt forgiveness/liquidation of         all U.S. citizens&#8217; credit card and mortgage debt as part of curing the         financial damages imposed on Americans by the corrupt banking system; 5)         restoring Constitutional Law and citizens&#8217; rights fully in the United         States; 6) removing corrupt politicians and officials of the federal         government from office; and MUCH MORE.<br />         The U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings were ordered kept SECRET until the         official public announcement of these sweeping government restorations.         This required that the NESARA law be passed secretly in March 2000. All         who were officially involved with it&#8217;s passage and implementation were         sworn to secrecy or faced TREASON charges and EXECUTION for breaking the         secrecy requirements.<br />         A group of powerful people became involved in actions to implement the         U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings of sweeping federal government         improvements. These people included many powerful U.S. Military officers         committed to the restoration of Constitutional Law, international         experts in monetary and banking systems, high judicial authorities, and         many others. I have named these people &#8220;White Knights&#8221; because         they are like the White Knights in high finance who come to the RESCUE         of those who are at the mercy of financial predators. (These White         Knights include people of ALL RACES, ethnicity, and religions.) The         White Knights worked tirelessly since 1993 to RESCUE Americans from the         clutches of the corrupt federal government and current banking system by         pursuing ways to implement the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings. After years         of negotiating &#8220;Accords&#8221; with the top officials of the U.S.         government and making little real progress in implementing the U.S.         Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings, the White Knights realized they needed to pass         a law which embodied all the Court&#8217;s requirements. NESARA is that law         and was passed secretly in March, 2000 to bring forth the sweeping         improvements ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />         Because of the intense involvement of top ranking officers in the U.S.         Military, Special Forces in the command of these officers performed         important support actions required by NESARA. Some of these Special         Forces included military intelligence groups with which I have         connections. I learned about the secret passage of NESARA through my         military intelligence connections. I had it confirmed by an agent of the         National Security Agency and this agent also found that NESARA was         signed on October 10, 2000 by Clinton. The NSA agent initially did not         believe that NESARA had been passed, however, after in-depth research         into top secret records, he was able to confirm its passage and give us         the date on which it was signed.<br />         Since Clinton&#8217;s signing of NESARA in October 2000, the White Knights         have pressed forward in activities to have NESARA fully implemented.<br />         Corrupt politicians and officials of the federal government have fought         NESARA&#8217;s implementation at every juncture. NESARA requires the         resignations of many federal government officials and politicians in         order to provide a CLEAN break with the past federal government FRAUD         and a NEW START under the restoration of Constitutional Law.<br />         (We will have new elections soon after NESARA is announced and a         transitional government as required by the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s         rulings.) The entrenched politicians and officials of the federal         government, while LEGALLY required by the U.S. Supreme Court to tender         their resignations and leave office, HAVE FOUGHT every step of the way         to keep NESARA from being implemented. In doing so, they have BETRAYED         EVERY American and CHEATED all Americans of the financial benefits of         NESARA! A few months ago in August 2001, the White Knights finally         finished working with top international banking authorities in the         revising of all international banking regulations into alignment with         NESARA and our new precious metals- backed currency. Next the White         Knights required the signed resignations of all members of Congress.         Some members of Congress fled and tried to hide to keep from signing the         resignations required by NESARA. The White Knights U.S. Military Special         Forces were assigned to find and obtain the written resignations of all         members of Congress; this took most of August.<br />         Finally, in a special session ending at 9 p.m. EDT on August 22, 2001,         the World Court (International Court of Justice in The Hague (city),         Netherlands) ruled that all the LEGAL requirements needed for NESARA to         be implemented had been met. The next step was the transition of the         U.S. federal government to NESARA. Beginning early on August 23, 2001         and through August 27, 2001, U.S. Marshals delivered legal orders         requiring compliance by the head of each federal government Department         with NESARA. The orders were signed by the sitting U.S. Supreme Court         Judge who also serves in the World Court and who has been appointed by         the World Court to use dual authority as World Court Judge and U.S.         Supreme Court Judge in all legal matters related to implementing NESARA.<br />         Per our D.C. sources there was a high degree of compliance among the         heads of the federal government Departments as the orders were served at         all agencies in and around the nation&#8217;s capitol. Officials of the IRS         agency, well aware of its impending abolishment, had the IRS building         doors locked in a vain attempt to resist being served with the         compliance orders. White Knight U.S. Military troops surrounded the         building and the IRS resistance caved in within hours.<br />         The next order of business was to obtain passage of two resolutions by         members of the U.S. House and Senate. The first resolution approved the         implementation of NESARA. The second resolution legally announced the         mass resignations of all members of each house of Congress. Members of         Congress returned from their summer break after Labor Day and delayed         passage of the required resolutions until Sunday, September 9th. In a         special closed session of Congress on Sunday September 9th, both houses         of Congress finally passed the required resolutions.<br />         Two days later on September 11, 2001, at 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,         Alan Greenspan, was scheduled to announce the new Treasury Bank system,         DEBT FORGIVENESS for all U.S. citizens, and abolishment of the IRS as         the first part of the public announcements of NESARA.<br />         (Greenspan&#8217;s famous doctoral thesis forms the basis for NESARA&#8217;s new         monetary system based on precious metals.) Instead, at just before and         after 9 a.m. EDT, planes attacked the World Trade Center. The attack on         the WTC served to stop the announcement of NESARA because a crucial         banking computer center on the first and second floors of the WTC was         prevented from carrying out a computer system download to U.S. banks         which was scheduled to begin at 9 A.M. EDT. The computer system download         to U.S. banks was a prerequisite to the NESARA banking changes         announcement.<br />         In addition, the location in Pennsylvania where the plane went down also         played a part in stopping the announcement. Finally, the south end of         the Pentagon where the last plane hit was exactly the location of the         technical communications command center which was supposed to coordinate         the broadcast of NESARA on all channels at the same time.<br />         Thus the four plane attacks essentially stopped the NESARA banking         changes announcement on September 11, 2001. Corrupt top officials of the         Bush administration ordered the 9/ 11 attacks on these four targets to         stop NESARA&#8217;s implementation; NESARA requires their removal from power         within 48 hours of the first NESARA announcement.<br />         Approximately 6,000 people died on September 11th due to orders given by         corrupt federal government officials and carried out through U.S. black         ops and their Arab stooges. Some of the top officials in the Bush         administration are involved in ordering and continuing the federal         government&#8217;s terrorism of Americans. They have also fought hard to keep         NESARA from being announced since September 11th in various ways         including sending the U.S. Military Special Forces, who were very         involved in carrying out missions supporting NESARA, to Afghanistan to         weaken the ability of the White Knights to make the NESARA announcement.<br />         Due to all the damage sustained on 9/11 and the many ramifications, it         has only been in the last two weeks that the banking requirements         necessary for NESARA&#8217;s announcement were finally once again ready.<br />         It is because all is now READY, that I am BREAKING the silence and         sending this news far and wide to ensure that NESARA is announced         immediately! Today, ALL U.S. citizens are being DEPRIVED of the massive         financial benefits of NESARA because a few thousand people in the         federal government are ABUSING their positions to try to stop NESARA&#8217;s         implementation. Nearly all Democrats and Republicans in D.C. have fought         hard to try to stop NESARA.<br />         Bush Jr. knew when he ran for office that NESARA was due to be announced         within the 2000/2001 timeframe and that he would be required to resign.         So did Gore. Bush Senior and Clinton also have known for years that the         Supreme Court&#8217;s rulings were going to be implemented. When Bush Jr. took         office, he signed a SIX MONTH agreement to resign as required by NESARA         when the six months was over. This agreement and other agreements were         negotiated per the requirements of the U.S. Supreme Court and the World         Court as part of the U.S. government restoration process. However, Bush         Jr. and his corrupt cohorts have continuously BROKEN every agreement         they have signed.<br />         Bush Jr. has used every tool at his disposal to try to stop Americans         receiving the benefits of NESARA. In July 2001, Bush administration         officials stated they intended to attack Afghanistan by mid-October 2001         (source: BBC 18th Sept. 2001), but had to order the 9/11 attacks on         September 11th to prevent the NESARA announcement from occurring in         order to delay Bush&#8217;s REMOVAL from office. Bush Jr. did sign resignation         papers on August 30, 2001 between 10:30 p.m. and midnight EDT. Per the         U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s requirements, at 12:01 a.m. on August 31, 2001, the         President Designate was sworn in as part of preparation for the NESARA         announcement which was intended to occur that weekend. (I&#8217;m told both         resignation and swearing in will be done again in the near future.)         Today, the U.S. is being still terrorized by the Black Ops groups         working for the federal government doing anthrax letters on order of         Bush Jr. and his corrupt officials in his desperate bid to find a way to         try to stay in the White House. Almost two weeks ago, Bush Jr. was         legally stripped of his powers due to his Treason against our country.<br />         Today, ALL U.S. citizens are OVERDUE to receive INCREASES in their CASH         in hand which come from NESARA&#8217;s announcement. HOW MUCH more MONEY would         YOU have if your credit card payments, mortgage payment, and federal         income tax amounts were suddenly turned into CASH that you could spend         any way you wish? How much better would your life be with these         financial burdens lifted off your shoulders? All it takes is a short         15-minute announcement of NESARA by one of the NESARA announcement team.         There are people who have been approved by the World Court to bring         NESARA into being. We can help by sending emails, faxes, and making         phone calls telling these people that we DEMAND to have NESARA announced         immediately! The World Court has designated the U.S. World Court Judge         to handle all legal matters and has designated U.S. Secretary of State         Colin Powell, U.S. Treasury Secretary O&#8217;Neil, and others, to make NESARA         public.<br />         2012 Unlimited<br />         PO Box 157, North Hobart, Tasmania, Australia 7002<br />         Phone 04 1899-2012, Fax 03 62250296<br />         Internet: www.2012.com.au, Email: 2012@2012.com.au<br />         The full NESARA bill is available as a pdf file on www.2012.com.au. Go         to Updates.<br />         NESARA: followup confirmation<br />         Hello Dear Friends, My sincere thanks to those of you who wrote to me         with YOUR OWN CONFIRMATIONS of the FACT that many U.S. banks are all         READY for the NESARA Treasury Bank announcement. Below are reports from         people in our egroup who found out for themselves that the new Treasury         Bank System process has been moving forward and some banking personnel         have admitted this. NESARA is the ONLY law which authorizes the new         Treasury Bank system. I apparently made a typo in a report this last         week regarding when NESARA was signed by Clinton. I have written about         this MANY times. Clinton signed NESARA into LAW secretly on October 10,         2000 &#8211; OVER A YEAR ago. A National Security Agency intelligence agent,         who doubted the truth of NESARA&#8217;s passage, did his own research into top         secret files and found that NESARA had been passed in March, 2000, and         was signed on 10/10/2000, six months after it was passed. This is COMMON         knowledge among those of us in the phone network who have TOP sources in         D.C. NESARA provides many wonderful improvements including: certain debt         forgiveness, the abolishment of the IRS, the new Treasury Bank System         which absorbs the Federal Reserve and uses new Treasury currency notes         backed by precious metals, the return to Constitutional law, and MUCH         MORE.<br />         I did receive one email seeming to indicate that someone&#8217;s aunt who         lives in Orange County had gone through the debt forgiveness process. I         believe there were several HUNDREDS of people in Orange County, Calif.,         who were processed through the bank debt forgiveness process as part of         a DEMONSTRATION project. My understanding is that after the NESARA         announcement, it is expected that some of these people will be         interviewed on television and will be able to tell people their own         experiences of already going through the debt forgiveness process. The         email I received seemed a little vague so I replied asking for         clarification. I&#8217;ve received some questions about the World Court,         formally known as the International Court of Justice. In fact, the         United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and most other         nations in the world have accepted the World Court&#8217;s rulings in matters         involving disputes between countries, in matters involving many         countries, and in other matters. The World Court is a branch of the U.N.         and its rulings are binding. That some of you lack this information is         hardly surprising since very few of us ever have reason to pay attention         to what the World Court is doing. The World Court fills the need of         adjudicating issues of contention between countries. Ask your friendly         local attorney; most are aware of the World Court although there are         special requirements for attorneys who appear in the World Court, just         as there are for those appearing before the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />         Below are some email confirmations I&#8217;ve received in the last few days         from people who have their own information about the FACT that NESARA is         ALREADY in process. I find the email from the person who saw the         photocopy of the NEW Treasury currency notes while in the bank two weeks         ago very interesting. I knew from my own sources that we definitely         should have had NESARA&#8217;s announcement and our prosperity deliveries at         that time, so it makes sense that the Treasury Department sent out         photocopies to all the banks of the new currency as part of preparation         for the announcement. The last item below about the person writing a         check to pay for items in a store and having her check returned to her         immediately is also PART of the new process that is being implemented         through the NESARA regulations. We will learn the details about this         from the NESARA announcement and follow-up news conferences. Another         email quotes a Delta Force military source. I&#8217;m taking this opportunity         to publicly thank the brave people of the Delta Force, Navy Seals and         many others in our military who have risked their lives so many times to         bring us NESARA and keep us all safe. Someday when the true story is         out, we will all realize how much we owe to the courageous patriots in         our U.S. military. (From what I&#8217;m hearing, our military will have new         very interesting challenges and exciting new options after NESARA and         the world improvements occur.) By the way, I note the number of members         in the Dove egroup below to let you know that there are more and more         people who want the truth. That&#8217;s why the Dove egroup has grown by         almost two thousand members in the last two months. I&#8217;m sure many of the         members of the Dove egroup already KNOW parts of the truth and are         looking for more. This is a GOOD sign that we WILL CLEAN UP this country         and our corrupt government because WE CARE. My sincere thanks to many of         you who have sent the NESARA support emails to D.C. and the World Court.         Our SUPPORT for NESARA IS HELPING to bring it forth for the benefit of         everyone!<br />         The TRUTH is out there in our U.S. banks already, but the         &#8220;officials&#8221; in D.C. are LEGALLY required to pretend that         NESARA is not passed.<br />         Blessings and Love, Dove of Oneness<br />         The Dove egroup currently has 4,859 members.<br />         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /></font></font></p>
