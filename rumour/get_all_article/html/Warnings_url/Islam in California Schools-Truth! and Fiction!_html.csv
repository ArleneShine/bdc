<p>              <font><b>Summary of eRumor:</b><font><br /></font><font>             The message says &#8220;Public             Schools Embrace Islam &#8211; A Shocker.&#8221;  It focuses on seventh             graders in Byron, California, and says that although students in a             growing number of public schools cannot wear crosses or utter the             name of Jesus, they are being required to attend an intensive             three-week course on Islam including mandated study of the tenets of             Islam, the important people of Islam, wearing of a robe, adopting a             Moslem name, and staging their own Jihad.  It says that the             California-required course uses a textbook that says a lot more             about Islam than about Christianity and quotes a teacher who says             she couldn&#8217;t teach Christianity like that and can&#8217;t even say the             name of Jesus in the classroom, but the seventh graders are learning how             to pray to Allah.</font></font>                   <font>
<p><b>The Truth:</b></p>
<p><font><br />             This eRumor has been explosive, both in terms of how quickly it grew             in circulation on the Internet and the reaction it prompted.</p>
<p><div class="td-a-rec td-a-rec-id-content_inline "><div style="text-align: center; " data-id="101804" id="truth-1649446971"><!-- Surge Pricing Unit - truthorfiction.com_728x90_adsense-midpage-728x90 -->

</div></div></div>             It is based on an article written for the ASSIST News Service by             Austin Miles, who is described as a chaplain, author, historian, speaker, educator, and veteran             master of ceremonies at various events around the country (he was a             circus ringmaster).</p>
<p>             Highlighting concerns over activities in a class about Islam in             Excelsior Middle School, the article suggests that the State of             California has &#8220;embraced Islam,&#8221; that a course on Islam             has been &#8220;stealthily&#8221; slipped into the seventh grade             statewide, that the course is mandated as are activities such as             wearing Islamic garb, adopting a Moslem name, and stating their own             Jihad.  The article also leaves the impression that students             and teachers are not allowed to utter the name of Jesus in a             classroom and that students cannot wear crosses.</font></font>
<p><font>Miles             interviewed Christina Lemings, a parent of a seventh grader who is             also a seventh grade teacher in the Byron Union School District in             Contra Costa County, in Northern California.  She said             that she did not know what was being taught in the class on Islam             until her son brought home a flyer from the Excelsior School about it.  She told Miles,             &#8220;they teach Islam as the true religion, and students are taught             about Islam and to pray to Allah.&#8221;  The article says she             has quickly learned that in public school, God and Christianity are             out (forbidden) but that Islam is in.</font>             </p>
<p><font>At question is what actually             happened in the classes about Islam at Excelsior school and to what             extent, as the article suggests, are these activities mandated             statewide?</p>
<p>             If the children were taught to pray to Allah or to participate in             any other Islamic devotional activities, that is an outrage             deserving of the protest of parents and other concerned             Californians.  </font>             </p>
<p><font><font>Lemings says there was             prayer to Allah in the class.  Other news reports have said             that the children were <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">required             to pray “in the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful&#8221;             and to stage their own Jihad.  Nancie Castro, the principle at             the middle school, denies the children were taught to pray or that             any of the children was required to participate in the cultural             activities of wearing Middle-Eastern clothing or choosing a Moslem             name.  </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She             told the Contra Costa Times that wearing the clothing was something             offered for extra credit.   </font></font><font>The             American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia has written a letter             to the Byron School district demanding that parents be given the             chance to choose whether their children participate in the required             course on Islam.  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Castro             says that  when the flyers about the course were sent to parents,             three families asked that their children be exempted from that             particular portion of the studies and they were given alternate             assignments. </font><font></p>
<p><font>             Peggy Green, the Superintendent of the Byron Union School district             says that the school is merely reflecting the California guidelines             for seventh grade and that the students are learning about Islam in the             same way that they learn about Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and             other major religions.  She says that individual teachers will             augment the curriculum with various activities and games, including             dressing-up and role playing, in order to stimulate class             discussion.  Green did not specifically say whether there had             been prayers to Allah or any other devotional activities encouraged             by the teacher at Byron.  Green says she and her staff have been             fielding calls and other messages to the school about the             controversy, many of which have been malignant and threatening.</p>
<p>             Lemings, the teacher interviewed by Miles, says she has been             troubled by the nature and content of some of the complaints to the             school and issued a statement on January 15 saying, &#8220;Our             schools have wonderful people teaching our children who are walking             a fine line trying to comply with their state&#8217;s regulations, a vague             understanding of the separation of church and state and the             possibility of a lawsuit on any given day.&#8221;  She said she             heard some of the recorded messages directed at her principal and             school and was ashamed of them and reminded people that the protest             was against decisions at the state level and that her concern was             over the way the textbook had handled these issues.</p>
<p>             Educators with whom TruthOrFiction.com has spoken, however,              say that they feel that the article sensationalized the issue and included some             misinformation.  It left the impression that this new class on             Islam had been &#8220;slipped&#8221; into California public schools             and that the state was mandating activities such as had been             described as happening in the Byron School District.</p>
<p>             Forrest Turpen is  the             Executive Director of the Christian Educator&#8217;s Association             International (www.ceai.org).  It is a Christian group committed to             educators and educational issues in public schools.  Turpin says the teaching about Islam has not been             &#8220;slipped&#8221; into the curriculum.  Islam has been an             important part of history, and therefore an important part of             studying history for a long time and is a part of the state             guidelines for seventh graders just as teaching about Christianity is a             part of the educational guidelines for 6th graders.  That is             the reason, according to Turpin, why the textbook &#8220;Across the             Centuries&#8221; deals with Islam more than Christianity.  It&#8217;s             a seventh grade text and that is the grade when Islam is studied. &#8220;In             fact,&#8221; says Turpin, &#8220;the state of California has been a             leader in requiring a balance of             teaching about who we are and what has empowered us as a civilization.&#8221;</font></font>             </p>
<p><font>Tom Adams, the administrator             for curriculum framework at the state education department, told the             Contra Costa Times that state guidelines (for seventh grade) do             include a unit on Islamic civilization in the medieval world, however,             it should be an academic approach on the historical significance of             the religion. It should not be construed as an endorsement of it.</p>
<p></font>             </p>
<p><font>How the guidelines are implemented             in the classroom is largely up to the teacher and critics say that             in many classrooms, Islam has been emphasized while other religions,             such as Christianity and Judaism, have sometimes been hardly touched             upon.  In an article on WorldNetDaily.com, Diana Lynne said             that other parents in California have reported             Islam-related activities that have caused them concern.  One             parent says her daughter was indoctrinated about Islam for four             months while in seventh grade in Elk Grove, California.  She             said one day, she arrived at school to find a banner in front that             said &#8220;There is one God, Allah, and Mohammad is his             prophet.&#8221;   She says she had also seen children             chanting from the Koran and praying.</p>
<p>             TruthOrFiction.com also reviewed the portions of the textbook             &#8220;Across the Centuries&#8221; that deal with Islam.  The text does present Islam in a positive             way, which critics say ignores some of the aspects of Islamic             history that aren&#8217;t so positive, especially violent conquest.</p>
<p>             Another complaint about the text is that it treats the claims of             Islam as &#8220;fact.&#8221;  TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed the             disputed passages and found that most of them, with a couple of             exceptions, are attributed in some way to Moslem belief, rather than             stated fact.  Several of the disputed passages that are being             passed around the Internet are from a section in the text that is             under the umbrella title &#8220;The Teachings of Islam.&#8221;              Many of the sentences in that section have no attribution because             they are already being presented as Islamic belief.  </font></p>
<p><font>There             is protest from some parents about the suggested student activities             in the textbook such as imaging being a Muslim soldier on the way to             conquer Syria and journaling thoughts about Islam and being in             battle; building a miniature mosque as a class activity; writing             about a journey to Mecca; Contemplating why Islam was so attractive             to Arabs and others in Southwest Asia.  One veteran teacher             told TruthOrFiction.com, however, that those kinds of suggested             activities are commonly used by teachers and that he doesn&#8217;t view             them as being in the book in order to favor Islam.  He said             that there are similar suggestions in the sixth grade textbook             including having the students discuss what role the Israelite&#8217;s             relationship with God played in the formation of their nation,             explaining the covenant that the Israelites made with God, imagining             being with the Jews when they were conquered by the Babylonians and             forced into exile, discussing how Judaism and Christianity are             related, how the teachings of Jesus were similar or different from             those of other Jews, and doing a presentation of the differences of             the religious views of the Sadducees and the Pharisees.<br /></font></p>

<p><font>By Reverend Austin Miles<br />         Special to ASSIST News Service</font></p>
<p><font>BRENTWOOD, CA (ANS) &#8212; As children return to school         this week, following the Christmas break, 7th graders in a growing         number of public schools, who are not permitted to wear a cross or speak         the name of Jesus, will be required to attend an intensive three week         course on Islam; a course in which students are mandated to learn the         tenets of Islam, study the important figures of the faith, wear a robe,         adopt a Muslim name and stage their own Jihad.</font></p>
<p><font>In Byron, California, parents were outraged when         students came home with their handouts and were told what was being         taught. Their complaints to the school principal not only were ignored,         but officials of this public school, funded by tax dollars, essentially         fluffed them off.</font></p>
<p><font>The public schools in California so stealthily slipped         this course into the 7th grade curriculum that even another 7th grade         teacher, Elizabeth Christina Lemings, was totally in the dark that this         was being taught until her son, Joseph, who is a 7th grader in the same         school where she teaches, brought home the handouts.</font></p>
<p><font>“We could never teach Christianity like this,”         Lemings said to ANS during an on-site interview. “We can’t even         mention the name of Jesus in the public schools, but over there…,”         she pointed to the building next to hers, “they teach Islam as the         true religion, and students are taught about Islam and how to pray to         Allah.”</font></p>
<p><font>Lemings, in her second year of teaching in the Byron         (Northern California) Union School District, has been a Christian since         1987. The government school system requires that she teach evolution in         her science class with no reference to creationism or any contrasting         viewpoint to Darwin’s theory. She quickly learned that God and         Christianity are out (forbidden) but that Islam is in.</font></p>
<p><font>The textbook used for the Islamic course, Across The         Centuries, is published by Houghton-Mifflin (Boston, Ma.). It is         described as a Social Studies/History book and has been adopted by the         California School System.</font></p>
<p><font>In it, Islam is presented broadly in a totally         positive manner, whereas the restricted references to Christianity, is         centered on The Reformation, Martin Luther and The Catholic Church.         Everything Christian is shown in a negative light, with events such as         the Inquisition, the Salem witch-hunts, etc. highlighted in bold, black         type.</font></p>
<p><font>This is proper for a complete study of history.         However, there is not one negative to be found about Islam in this         one-sided account, such as the wars, massacres, cruelties against         Christians and other non-Muslims that Islam has consistently perpetrated         over the centuries.</font></p>
<p><font>Nor is any mention made of the way Muslims treat their         own people, cutting off hands, feet and heads for even the slightest         violations of the Islamic tenets of faith, or the shocking way they         treat their women.</font></p>
<p><font>The ‘miraculous’ events leading up to the Koran,         the ‘holy’ book of Islam, and other ‘revelations’ are presented         as factual. Any reference of the miraculous regarding Christianity is         always set next to a disclaimer stating that; “It was (is) believed by         Christians (or an individual such as Martin Luther) that…..,”implying         an absence of credibility about the stated event.</font></p>
<p><font>For example, the representation that Gabriel the         archangel came to Muhammad (Note: not believed to have come to Muhammad)         and dictated to him the Koran, a whole new revelation and idea that         would surpass all other religions.</font></p>
<p><font>What needs to be explained by the Houghton-Mifflin         historians, is why Gabriel (which translates, “Man of God”), the         archangel of both Christians and Jews, who was a part of all of God’s         plan, who interpreted for Daniel the vision of the ram and the he-goat,         and comforted him after his prayer with the prophecy of the ‘seventy         weeks’ and who heralded the good tidings by declaring the coming of         the predicted Messiah, would at that point in time and history, call on         Muhammad, one who did not believe in Jehovah God or Jesus as the Son of         God, and ‘reveal’ to him the words of the pagan god Allah to lead         his people with. How’s that again?</font></p>
<p><font>It would be most interesting to have the         Houghton-Mifflin experts explain what possessed Gabriel to turn on the         God of Abraham and Jesus Christ to lend assistance to what would become         a murderous cult with no regard for life, the very antithesis of         Christianity. There is a deplorable lack of information here.</font></p>
<p><font>And too, the Book of Revelation clearly states that no         words should be added or taken away from that book. So this in itself         poses a major contradiction and problem.</font></p>
<p><font>The faulty textbook, Across the Centuries, has more         than its share of deceit. It is stated as fact that Islam, Judaism and         Christianity share in common the belief in one god. This is a half-         truth, which is the worst kind of lie. Christianity and Judaism worship         one God, the God of Abraham. Islam worships one god named Allah. This         hook is misleading on the part of Houghton-Mifflin. The publisher         apparently is attempting to legitimize Islam.</font></p>
<p><font>If this were an authentic history, the textbook would         explain that the god of Muhammad was man’s creation. Arabia was a         pagan nation that worshiped over 300 gods. One of those was the moon god         named, al-ilah. Legend has it that the moon god mated with the sun god         and had two daughters, both of whom were worshiped as goddesses. When         Muhammad claimed to have had his ‘vision’ and ‘revelation from         Gabriel’ he chose<br />         al-ilah as the god to build his army around.</font></p>
<p><font>Muhammad shortened the name, al-ilah, to, Allah, and         declared that he alone should be worshiped. He forbade the worship of         the daughters. To this day, a crescent moon can be found at the front of         every mosque, acknowledging that Allah was, and is the moon god. All of         this is missing from the Houghton-Mifflin accounts.</font></p>
<p><font>It is also to be noted, even though not publicized,         that Allah is also known as, The God of War. So why isn’t this         important study of Islam included in the history books?</font></p>
<p><font>The handouts used in this course, obtained by ANS, are         considerable. They include a history of Islam and the life of Muhammad         its founder.</font></p>
<p><font>Muhammad is portrayed as an extremely moral man who         wanted a society of purity. A vast body of historical accounts will         refute this image. Historians will show that he had multiple wives, a         sexual problem, and among his wives, he took a 10-year-old girl for his         pleasure (some accounts list her age as 6).</font></p>
<p><font>And Islam promises its followers that those who become         suicide bombers, killing themselves and others, will go directly to         Allah’s paradise where they will be given 72 virgins for unbridled         sexual pleasure for all of eternity.</font></p>
<p><font>There are many verses in the Koran that must be         memorized in this Public School course and students are taught to pray,         “in the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful” and to         chant, “Praise to Allah, Lord of Creation.”</font></p>
<p><font>There are 25 Islamic terms that must be memorized, six         Islamic (Arabic) phrases, 20 Islamic Proverbs to learn along with the         Five Pillars of Faith and 10 key Islamic prophets and disciples to be         studied.</font></p>
<p><font>“Can you imagine the barrage of lawsuits and         problems we would have from the ACLU if Christianity were taught in the         public schools, and if we tried to teach about the contributions of         Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and the Apostle Paul?” teacher Elizabeth         Lemings lamented. “But when it comes to furthering the Islamic         religion in the public schools, there is not one word from the ACLU,         People For The American Way or anybody else. This is hypocrisy!”</font></p>
<p><font>Even more disturbing; students are to pretend that         they are Muslims, wear Muslim clothing to school, stage their own Jihad         via a dice game, and pick out a Muslim name (to replace their own) from         a list of thirty.</font></p>
<p><font>ANS asked some of the students what they thought about         this course. All of them felt that “it was fun,” while others         described Islam as “a pretty culture.” This included a pastor’s         son! Joseph Lemings, 12, said, “the Jihad was like playing a video         game,” even though the true violent nature of Jihad was well         concealed.</font></p>
<p><font>Lemings is disturbed by the “fun” description. She         sees it as a tool, not only to engender sympathy and support for the         Muslim cause, but for recruitment. “This is not just a class of         history of examining culture,” she said. “This course is entirely         too specific. It is more about indoctrination.”</font></p>
<p><font>Lemings, upon learning of the course on Islam,         approached the principal of Intermediate-Excelsior School of Byron,         Nancy Castro, requesting the right to teach Christianity in the manner         that Islam is taught and for the same length of time.</font></p>
<p><font>Castro has not responded to her request. Lemings later         received, roundabout, information that the only way she could do this         would be to teach the Christianity class (as a Christian Club) after         school hours where students would come of their own accord. Otherwise,         she would violate the law of (selective) Separation of Church and State.         Excuse me?</font></p>
<p><font>In an interview with Nancy Castro, the principal of         the schools in Byron, she stated to ANS that the Islam course (hidden         within “History of Cultures”) reflects California (educational)         Standards that meet State requirements.</font></p>
<p><font>When asked about the intensity of the Islamic course,         Castro stated that the course “is not religion, but Ancient Culture         and History. And,” she pointed out, “the text is a State Adopted         textbook. We do not endorse any religion, we just make students aware.”</font></p>
<p><font>She stated that the textbook is now in use throughout         California. When asked if she would allow Christianity to be taught the         same way that Islam is taught, Castro stammered before saying that         Christianity is already taught in the History and Culture class, “which,”         she said, “actually starts in the 6th grade.”</font></p>
<p><font>She said that this class started a year ago. The         Christianity that is taught is brief, taught as a myth, and strictly         negative. This is how it is portrayed in the textbook.</font></p>
<p><font>Lemings had stated to ANS that there were many, many         parents who protested this course on Islam, especially after September         11th ( which, coincidently, is when the course began).. Nancy Castro         contradicted this account.</font></p>
<p><font>Asked if there was any response from parents about         this course, Castro answered, “Oh a couple of parents called to         express concerns, three to be exact.”</font></p>
<p><font>Peggy Green, Superintendent of the Byron Union School         District did not return calls by press time.</font></p>
<p><font>The Muslim’s intentions are clear and the public has         been continually notified of that fact. In nearby Fremont, where the         majority of the over 150,000 Muslims living in the Bay Area reside, Omar         M. Ahmad, chairman of the board of the Council on American-Islamic         relations said this at the Flamingo Palace banquet hall: “I urge         Muslims not to shirk their duty of sharing the Islamic faith with those         who are on the ‘wrong-side’.”</font></p>
<p><font>He said that Muslims should not assimilate into         American society. “If you choose to live here, you have a         responsibility to deliver the message of Islam…Islam isn’t in         America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The         Koran should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only         accepted religion on earth,” he said.<br />         These quotes were published in the” San Ramon Valley Herald” on July         4, 1998 (ironically on our Independence Day), 3 years, 2 months and 7         days before September 11, 2001. And like everything else, Americans and         church leaders didn’t pay any attention to it.<br />         In the same article, Ahmad stated: “Everything we need to know is in         the Koran.” And bear in mind that the Koran clearly states that         Muslims are obligated to kill Christians, Jews and all other infidels.</font></p>
<p><font>So why would the American Public School System and the         politicians want to further the Islamic faith, push to have it become         the One World Religion and nix Christianity?</font></p>
<p><font>Simple. Christians cannot be enslaved. Islam, an         oppressive religion of control, cruelty and fear does enslave, which can         keep people subdued. This is precisely what the future leaders of the         One World Order want to achieve. And the misinformed, make nice,         politically correct crowd seem eager to help them accomplish it.</font></p>
<p><font>But the greatest driving factor in all of this is         money. There are the profiteers and politicians who stand to grow in         unspeakable wealth and power by cooperating with the Arabs and finding         favor by helping them and their pagan religion take control. They have         no compunction in selling us out, and our freedom, to accomplish their         goals. These greedy, self-serving investors stand salivating on both         sides of the oil pump.**(see below)<br />         &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />         Rev.

He has been Master-of-Ceremonies for major events in Madison         Square Garden, The Brooklyn Academy of Music, Radio City Music Hall and         at the United Nations in New York **where he was M.C. for the opening of         the new Libyan Embassy. He was not surprised at the various world         leaders he introduced who were there as friends of Libya. But what         unsettled him was the number of American financiers and oil men who were         there as friends of this terrorist nation.</font></p>
