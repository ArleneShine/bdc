<p><strong>Summary of eRumor:</strong></p>
<p>This elaborate email promises quick money if you follow the instructions carefully.  It talks about multi-level marketing opportunities and says you can benefit from entering into the multi-level marketing world.</p>
<p>The email includes the titles of four &#8220;reports&#8221; on money-making opportunities that you are to order through the mail for $5 each.  The names and addresses from which to order the reports are listed in the email.  When you receive the reports, you are to add your name to the list of people from which the reports can be ordered and send emails to as many people as you can, encouraging them to order reports as well.  There are several phrases in the email saying it is not a chain letter and is not illegal.  The writers even claim to have checked it out with the Post Office.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:  </strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service says this is nothing more than a chain letter scheme, which not only doesn&#8217;t work, but if you use the mail for perpetuating it, you&#8217;re violating the law.</p>
<p><div class="td-a-rec td-a-rec-id-content_inline "><div style="text-align: center; " data-id="101804" id="truth-1780956917"><!-- Surge Pricing Unit - truthorfiction.com_728x90_adsense-midpage-728x90 -->

  <script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">surgeprice.display("truthorfiction.com_728x90_adsense-midpage-728x90");</script>
</div></div></div>Additionally, this not an example of legitimate multi-level marketing.  It&#8217;s merely a masquerade.  Multi-level-marketing can be a productive way for a person to participate in a business opportunity without a big investment.  The best multi-level options are from respected companies that have developed a good reputation, are not asking for a large financial investment to get into the company, and are legitimately marketing products.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/c/chains.htm">TruthOrFiction Focus on Chain Letters</a><b></b></p>
<p>There is also a version of this scam email that says a 15-year-old boy made $71,000 in a matter of weeks by participating in the sales of the &#8220;reports.&#8221;  The message is that if he did it, you can too.  That message also falsely claims that the story was broadcast on national television.</p>
<p>In August, 2002, a new version started circulating that appeals to folks to become involved in the scam on a humanitarian basis..  It talks about orphans dying in Africa and suggests that people sign-up for the scam so they can get rich and make donations for the needy.</p>

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990&#8217;s. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.<br />
You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response: &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!&#8221;</p>
<p>The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn&#8217;t seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!<br />
In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month&#8217;s prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year&#8230;it didn&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;d have to write a book to make it!</p>
<p>But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I didn&#8217;t send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided &#8220;WHY NOT.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don&#8217;t need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail, my only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is I hope it doesn&#8217;t turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not &#8220;rip-off&#8221; anyone, no matter how much money it made me.</p>
<p>In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1 By January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to &#8220;RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON&#8217;T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!&#8221; My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to &#8220;RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL.&#8221; Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day.</p>
<p>I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!! ! Remember, it won&#8217;t work if you don&#8217;t try it. This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won&#8217;t work and you&#8217;ll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!</p>
<p>If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Johnathon Rourke</p>
<p>A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:<br />
By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn&#8217;t working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn&#8217;t me, it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945.I don&#8217;t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate&#8230; because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.</p>
<p>The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, &#8220;THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.&#8221; The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to &#8220;move up&#8221; or &#8220;get rich&#8221;, inflation will see to that.</p>
<p>You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with &#8220;NO RISK&#8221; and &#8220;JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.&#8221; You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program. I have already made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs.</p>
<p>Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000&#8230;and your name will be on everyone of them!</p>
<p>Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.</p>
<p>So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!</p>
<p>&#8220;THINK ABOUT IT&#8221;</p>
<p>Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS!<br />
Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA</p>
<p>HERE&#8217;S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$<br />
INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say &#8220;BULL&#8230; &#8220;, please read this program carefully.</p>
<p>This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere.</p>
<p>This is what you MUST do:</p>
<p>1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can&#8217;t sell them if you don&#8217;t order them). &#8212; For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &amp; RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! &#8212; When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports. You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. &#8212; Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000&#8217;s of people who will order them from you.</p>
<p>2. IMPORTANT DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps &#8220;a&#8221; through &#8220;f&#8221; or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you&#8217;ll also see how it doesn&#8217;t work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing of available reports. b. After you&#8217;ve ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.</p>
<p>Please make sure you COPY ALL INFORMATION, every name and address, ACCURATELY!</p>
<p>3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter.</p>
<p>Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!</p>
<p>There are two primary methods of building your downline:</p>
<p>METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL<br />
Let&#8217;s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we&#8217;ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let&#8217;s also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That&#8217;s 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists.</p>
<p>METHOD #2 &#8211; PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<br />
Advertising on the internet is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let&#8217;s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:</p>
<p>1st level&#8211;your 10 members with $5&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;$50 2nd level&#8211;10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;$500 3rd level&#8211;10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..$5,000 4th level&#8211;10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)&#8230;..$50,000 THIS TOTALS &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;$55,550<br />
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100&#8217;s of participants! THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT&#8217;S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can&#8217;t advertise until they receive the report!</p>

If you don&#8217;t receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue<br />
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don &#8216;t, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!</p>
<p>THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.

<p><b><span style="color: #000000">Example #2</span></b><span style="color: #000000"></p>
<p></span>AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report (a true story).</p>
<p>PARENTS OF 15-YEAR-OLD FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!</p>
<p>Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely<br />
have<br />
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news<br />
program<br />
(USA) and reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the<br />
woods &#8211; New Zealand).<br />
It could have happened anywhere &#8211; SINGAPORE, GERMANY, ENGLAND,<br />
MALAYSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, JAPAN, CANADA, AUSTRALIA. anywhere.</p>
<p>His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across<br />
a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some<br />
clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons<br />
closet.<br />
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened<br />
the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,<br />
fifties and hundreds &#8211; all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first thought was that he had robbed a bank&#8221;, says the<br />
41-year-old<br />
woman, &#8220;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag &#8212; that&#8217;s more<br />
than my<br />
husband earns in a year&#8221;.</p>
<p>The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where<br />
he<br />
worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away<br />
and<br />
they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did<br />
they<br />
suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than<br />
actually<br />
finding it in the closet.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type<br />
of<br />
&#8220;Report&#8221; to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet.<br />
Everyday<br />
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on<br />
his<br />
computer in his bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my<br />
name on<br />
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out&#8221;, says<br />
the clever<br />
15-year-old.</p>
<p>The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to<br />
send one<br />
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at<br />
the<br />
bottom ( #5) and move the others addresses Down , and finally to<br />
add<br />
your name to the top of the list.</p>
<p>The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand<br />
dollars<br />
in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with<br />
your<br />
name at the top of the 5-address list. &#8220;I get junk E-mail all the<br />
time, and<br />
really did not think it was going to work&#8221;, the boy continues.</p>
<p>Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office<br />
Box<br />
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine<br />
subscriptions<br />
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5<br />
bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my<br />
box had<br />
1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a<br />
yellow<br />
slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.</p>
<p>I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&#8221;. He goes on, &#8220;I<br />
went up to<br />
the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to<br />
ride back<br />
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.<br />
&#8220;The<br />
Money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it<br />
in the<br />
closet, barely had time for my homework&#8221;. He had also been riding<br />
his bike to<br />
several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for<br />
twenties,<br />
fifties and hundreds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to<br />
different<br />
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would<br />
usually tell<br />
the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange<br />
the<br />
money] and he was outside waiting for me .One time the lady gave me a<br />
really<br />
strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me<br />
and my<br />
dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank<br />
down<br />
the street (laughs).&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The<br />
reporting<br />
news team examined and<br />
investigated the so-called &#8220;chain-letter&#8221; the boy was sending out<br />
and found<br />
that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely<br />
legal<br />
according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and<br />
1341, or<br />
Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal<br />
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product<br />
or<br />
service must be exchanged for money received.</p>
<p>Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that<br />
read,<br />
&#8220;Please send me report number XYX&#8221;. This simple note made the<br />
letter legal<br />
because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a<br />
five-dollar<br />
fee.</p>
<p>[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to<br />
understand how<br />
the system works and get your $71,000 &#8211; please continue reading.<br />

<p>Dear Friend:<br />
&#8220;Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home<br />
for an<br />
investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time&#8221;</p>
<p>THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!<br />
===============================================<br />
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR !!<br />
Before you say &#8220;Bull&#8221;, please read the following. This is the<br />
letter you<br />
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of<br />
this<br />
letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently<br />
devoted an<br />
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to<br />
see if<br />
it really can make people money.<br />
The show also investigated whether or not the program was<br />
legal.<br />
Their findings proved once and for all that there are &#8220;absolutely no<br />
laws<br />
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow<br />
the<br />
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only<br />
$25<br />
out of pocket cost&#8221;.</p>
<p>DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS<br />
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER<br />
THAN EVER.</p>
<p>This is what one had to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times<br />
before<br />
but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to<br />
see what<br />
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.<br />
To my<br />
astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money<br />
still<br />
coming in&#8221;.<br />
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.<br />

Here is another testimonial:<br />
&#8220;This program has been around for a long time but I never believed<br />
in it.<br />
But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to<br />
gamble my<br />
$25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa &#8230;.. 3 weeks<br />
later<br />
the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the<br />
next 2<br />
months after that I made a total of $290,000.00.<br />
So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made<br />
over<br />
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again.<br />
The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and<br />
NOT<br />
change anything .&#8221;</p>

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</p>
<p>FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL<br />
COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.<br />
**** For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE<br />
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS<br />
to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.<br />
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE<br />
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.</p>
<p>**** When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5<br />
reports.<br />
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your<br />
computer and<br />
resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.</p>
<p>**** Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5<br />
reports<br />
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so<br />
they will<br />
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000&#8217;s of people who will<br />
order them<br />
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your<br />
desk in<br />
case something happens to your computer.</p>
<p>****.IMPORTANT &#8211; DO NOT alter the names of the people who are<br />
listed<br />
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other<br />
than what<br />
is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will loose out on<br />
the majority<br />
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will<br />
also see<br />
how it does not work if you change it.</p>
<p>Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will<br />
NOT<br />
work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all<br />
five<br />
thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this<br />
way.<br />
Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing<br />
happened.</p>
<p>So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed.<br />
Because if<br />
you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the<br />
reward!!!</p>
<p>1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement<br />
and<br />
REMOVE the name &amp; address of the person in REPORT # 5. This<br />
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their<br />
fortune.</p>
<p>2&#8230;. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.<br />
3&#8230;. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.<br />
4&#8230;. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.<br />
5&#8230;. Move the name &amp; address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2<br />
6&#8230;. Insert YOUR name &amp; address in the REPORT # 1 Position.<br />
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name &amp; address ACCURATELY!<br />
=========================================================</p>
<p>Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it<br />
on<br />
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.<br />
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data.</p>
<p>To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5<br />
reports<br />
you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information<br />
which<br />
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of<br />
free<br />
classified ads and much more.</p>
<p>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:</p>
<p>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY<br />
============================================<br />
Let&#8217;s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,<br />
and we<br />
will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.<br />
Let&#8217;s<br />
also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% response (the<br />
response<br />
could be much better but let&#8217;s just say it is only 0.2%. Also<br />
many<br />
people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only<br />
5,000<br />
each).</p>
<p>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.<br />
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10<br />
people<br />
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out<br />
of<br />
those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That&#8217;s = 100<br />
people<br />
responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000<br />
e-mails<br />
each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is<br />
1000<br />
orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each<br />
for a<br />
total of 5 million e-mails sent out.<br />
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those<br />
10,000<br />
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50<br />
million)<br />
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #<br />
5.</p>
<p>THAT&#8217;S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half million).</p>
<p>Your total income in this example is:<br />
1&#8230;.. $50 +<br />
2&#8230;.. $500 +<br />
3&#8230;.. $5,000 +<br />
4&#8230;.. $50,000 +<br />
5&#8230;.. $500,000 &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Grand Total = $555,550.00</p>
<p>NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND FIGURE OUT<br />
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU<br />
WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING<br />
OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would<br />
happen if everyone, or half, or even one 4th of those people mailed<br />
100,000<br />
e-mails each, or more? There are over 250 million people on the<br />
internet<br />
worldwide, and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that,<br />
and more!</p>
<p>METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<br />
===================================================<br />
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are<br />
hundreds of<br />
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet<br />
will<br />
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with<br />
Method # 1<br />
and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.</p>
<p>For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report<br />
they<br />
ordered. That&#8217;s it. Always provide same day service on all orders.<br />
This will<br />
guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address<br />
on it,<br />
will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the<br />
report.</p>
<p>ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.</p>
<p>Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks<br />
NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at<br />
least 2<br />
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER &amp;<br />
the<br />
NAME of the Report you are ordering, and very clearly, YOUR E-MAIL<br />
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.</p>

<p>$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$<br />
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:</p>
<p>If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2<br />
weeks,<br />
continue sending e-mails until you do.</p>
<p>After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you<br />
should<br />
receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2.<br />
If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you<br />
do.</p>
<p>Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN<br />
RELAX,<br />
because the system is already working for you , and the cash will<br />
continue<br />
to roll in !</p>
<p>THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved<br />
down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.<br />
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people<br />
are<br />
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER<br />
BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS<br />
AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this<br />
business !!!<br />

<p>************** MORE TESTIMONIALS ****************</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.<br />
I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty<br />
good<br />
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about<br />
receiving<br />
&#8221;junk mail&#8221;. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my<br />
knowledge of the<br />
population and percentages involved. I &#8221;knew&#8221; it wouldn&#8217;t<br />
work. Jody<br />
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she<br />
jumped in<br />
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the<br />
old<br />
&#8221;I told you so&#8221; on her when the thing didn&#8217;t work. Well, the<br />
laugh was on<br />
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45<br />
days<br />
she had received a total of $ 147,200.00 all cash! I was shocked. I<br />
have<br />
joined Jody in her &#8221;hobby&#8221;.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my<br />
mind to<br />
participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that<br />
the<br />
initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I<br />
wouldn&#8217;t<br />
get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when<br />
I<br />
found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made<br />
$319,210.00<br />
in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does<br />
not<br />
matter where people live. There simply isn&#8217;t a better investment<br />
with a<br />
faster return and so big.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I<br />
wondered if I<br />
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact<br />
to get<br />
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by<br />
someone<br />
else&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;11 months passed then it luckily came again&#8230;&#8230; I did<br />
not<br />
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all<br />
the money<br />
came within 22 weeks&#8221;.<br />

&#8220;It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money<br />
with little<br />
cost to you. I followed the simple<br />
instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come<br />
in. My<br />
first month I made $ 20,560.00<br />
and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<br />
Life is<br />
beautiful, Thanx to internet&#8221;.<br />

<p><b>Example #3</b><br />
Dear Sir/Madam:</p>
<p>Please take a few minutes of your time to read this message, before you<br />
delete it.</p>
<p>After watching on CNN a story in Africa &#8212; especially in Zambia,<br />
Zimbabwe<br />
and Angola &#8212; that there are millions of orphan children dieing of<br />
hunger<br />
and that their parents either died of AIDS or war, I read this e-mail<br />
message.<br />
It gave me an idea!</p>
<p>&#8220;How about using this method to raise funds in order that each one of<br />
us,<br />
would use this kind of money (half of a million dollars) to make it a<br />
better world.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are the lucky ones: we have everything, and we also have<br />
the power of the Internet. We can help those children, with<br />
containers full of food, medicine, school stationary and clothes. We<br />
can also use this kind of money to help to solve some of our modern city</p>
<p>problems: homeless people who need our help.<br />
Well, I have decided to join this powerful money raising method, which<br />
is called the &#8220;Millionaire Reports&#8221;. I also decided that this letter<br />
should be called &#8220;A Letter With a Mission&#8221;<br />
and it is for a good purpose.</p>
<p>You can also do it! You can make the difference!<br />
With a little effort on your part, you could help others who need your<br />
good will<br />
to make it a better world. What you will do with this money is entirely<br />
up to<br />
you: distribute to charity organizations, or just go out there and<br />
try to help those who might need your contribution.</p>

This letter was presented to me this way:<br />

<p>&lt;It then has the same scam appeal as above&gt;</p>
