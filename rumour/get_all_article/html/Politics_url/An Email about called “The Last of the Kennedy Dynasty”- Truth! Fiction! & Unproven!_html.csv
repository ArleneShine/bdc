</div></div></div><b>The Truth:</b></p>
</p>
<p></font><font>This eRumor began circulating  		more than a year prior to Senator Edward (Teddy)  Kennedy&#8217;s death  		in August, 2009, but it was revived after he died on August 25, 2009 as  		a result of brain cancer. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font><br /> 		Serving in the US Senate for the state of Massachusetts from 1962 to  		2009, Kennedy championed many controversial and liberal issues from  		abortion to immigration reform during his political career. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>According to a May 20,  		2008 NPR article, after a seizure the Senator was diagnosed with a  		malignant t glioma, a form of brain cancer in May of 2008. The article  		said that treatment for this form of cancer usually involves surgery,  		radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
<p> 		Some of the points of this email appear to have been taken from a page  		about Senator Kennedy on the Who&#8217;s Who website www.nbdb.com. Some other  		comments might have been added by others who forwarded this email.    		<a href="HTTP://WWW.NBDB.COM">Click</a> for NBDB site.  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Let&#8217;s look at them  		one-at-a-time::</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font>1: Kennedy was caught  		cheating at Harvard and expelled twice, once for cheating on a test, and  		once for paying a classmate to cheat for him.   </font> 		<font color="#008000">Truth! </font><font>and </font> 		<font color="#FF0000">Fiction!</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Adam Clymer is a  		journalist who covered Washington for the New York Times who had been  		writing about Ted Kennedy since he played football for Harvard in the  		1950&#8217;s. Clymer wrote a book called, <i>Edward M. Kennedy: a biography 		</i>based on personal interviews with the senator as well as published  		reports. </p>
<p> 		According to Clymer&#8217;s book, Kennedy was expelled only once from Harvard,  		not twice, and he never paid a classmate to cheat for him.</p>
<p> 		According to Clymer, it was in 1951 that Kennedy had a fellow student  		named Bill Frate take his Spanish exam. Kennedy was concerned his C  		-minus grade could result in his removal from the Harvard football team.  		Clymer said, there was no monetary compensation for the cheating episode  		and as a friend, Frate agreed to take the test in Kennedy&#8217;s name. Frate  		was recognized by a graduate student who proctored the exam when the  		exam was handed in. The two were reported to and shortly afterwards  		expelled from the university. They were told that they could reapply in  		one or two years if their conduct improved. Ted returned to Harvard  		after 1953 where he worked harder in his studies and earned an A minus  		in Spanish and eventually graduated with a Bachelors degree in 1956.</font><b><font color="#FF0000"><br />  </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font>2. Kennedy enlisted in the  		Army for four years.  His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S.  		Ambassador to England, intervened to have his enlistment shortened to  		two years.  </font></b><b><font color="#008000">Truth!  </font> 		</b></p>
<p align="justify"><font>According to Clymer&#8217;s  		book, Kennedy spent three or four weeks figuring out what he was going  		to do after his expulsion from Harvard and on June 25, 1951 enlisted in  		the U.S. Army.   The Korean War was already a year old and the  		young Kennedy, unaware of the student deferment policy signed induction  		papers for a four year term.   Having already lost a son in  		World War II, His father, Joseph Kennedy, was able to intervene in  		Teddy&#8217;s behalf and reduced his hitch in the Army by two years.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font>3. While in the  		Army, Kennedy was assigned to Paris but never advanced beyond the rank  		of Private.  </font><font color="#008000">Truth!  </font></b> 		</p>
<p align="justify"><font>Clymer said that,  		after basic training at Fort Dix, in New Jersey Private Kennedy was  		assigned to Camp Gordon in Georgia for three months for military police  		training. There were a couple of incidents that resulted in a lot of  		latrine duty for Kennedy. Among them was a incident when on a cold night  		he tried to keep warm using a can of Sterno, a fuel made from jellied  		and denatured alcohol. It caused a fire when his sleeping bag ignited.  		Once again, at the intervention of Joe Kennedy, the Private was assigned  		as part of the honor guard for the headquarters of the North Atlantic  		Treaty Organization (NATO) in Paris, France. Kennedy received an  		honorable discharge from the US Army in 1953 at the rank of Private.</font></p>
<p><b><font>4. While attending law  		school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving  		four times.  </font></b><font color="#FF0000"><b>Unproven!   		</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Kennedy did attend the  		University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville. His biographer  		said that Kennedy “drove wildly and got several speeding tickets.” The  		book also said that he once out ran a police car. </font></p>
<p><b><font>5. In 1964, Kennedy was legally  		intoxicated when his plane crashed.  He hospitalized for several  		months. The results of the blood alcohol test remained a &#8220;state secret&#8221;  		until in the 1980&#8217;s.   </font><font color="#FF0000">Fiction!</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font>This makes it sound as  		though Kennedy was the pilot and that he was flying drunk. He was a  		passenger, however, and alcohol had nothing to do with either Kennedy or  		the accident.</p>
<p> 		The plane crash happened on June 10, 1964. Kennedy, his wife Joan,  		Indiana Senator Birch Baye, Senator Baye’s wife, and Kennedy’s  		administrative assistant, Ed Moss, were being flown Washington D.C. to  		West Springfield, Massachusetts, the location of the Democratic Party  		Convention. The plane struck the ground during an instrument approach  		and a later investigation blamed the crash on pilot error.</p>
<p> 		Kennedy was seriously injured in the crash, spent months in  		rehabilitation, and was plagued with back pain for the rest of his life.

<p align="justify"><font>This is one of the  		most famous incidents in Kennedy’s life. It is true that a car that he  		was driving went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island on July 19, 1969  		and that a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne died in the accident.</p>
<p> 		According to Clymer&#8217;s book, it was a hot July day on the island and  		Kennedy had competed in the annual Edgartown Regatta, a sailboat race,  		earlier and finished in ninth place out of 31 boats. After the race,  		Kennedy returned to his hotel room, soaked his back in a hot bath and  		drank a rum and coke. He later went to a reunion of Robert Kennedy  		campaign workers which was also attended by Mary Jo Kopechne who worked  		for Robert Kennedy as a legislative aide. It is thought that Kopechne  		might have been feeling ill from exposure to the sun from the day&#8217;s  		events and Kennedy left the party with her after 11:00 PM to take her  		back to the inn where she was staying. </p>
<p> 		The fatal accident took place a mile and a half from the cottage where  		the party was still taking place. The Oldsmobile that Kennedy had been  		driving went off the bridge on the right side, overturned and landed in  		the pond where it quickly submerged under the water. Kennedy managed to  		escape the sinking vehicle but Kopechne didn&#8217;t</p>
<p> 		According to published reports, Kennedy stumbled back to the cottage and  		two other people from the party then went to the scene of the accident  		and tried to rescue Kopechne, but without success. One of the lingering  		controversies of the incident is that no one reported it to authorities.  		Police learned of it from two fishermen the next morning who happened  		upon the scene.</p>
<p> 		The following day, when the police arrived on the scene and began their  		investigation Kennedy told them that he was not sure how he had escaped  		the submerged car and that he dove down to to the point of exhaustion  		see if his passenger was still in the car. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Clymer wrote that the  		crash left Kennedy with a moderate brain concussion which resulted in  		memory failure and confusion. </p>
<p> 		Kennedy was charged with leaving the scene of an accident to which he  		pleaded guilty. Kennedy testified in the inquest that he had only drank  		two drinks at the party. He was sentenced to 2 months jail time which  		was suspended. </p>

Not to mention the pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme  		Court nominees- </font><font color="#008000">TRUTH!</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font>According to a 		<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/27/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5269454.shtml"> 		<font>August 27, 2009 CBS News article</font></a>,  		immigration reform was a lifelong cause for Senator Kennedy and he  		&#8220;dramatically changed the United States&#8217; immigration system with the  		Immigration Act of 1965, which eliminated the quota system and allowed  		immigration from Latin America and Asia to dramatically increase.&#8221;    		The article said, &#8220;He also worked to pass the Refugee Act of 1980, and  		in 1986 he supported a measure that allowed nearly three million  		undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and established penalties  		against employers who hired illegal immigrants. He supported the  		Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the number of immigrants that  		could enter the country, including those who could enter with permanent  		job-related visas and temporary worker visas.&#8221; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>In 2007 Senators  		Kennedy cosponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007  		which failed passage.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Because of timing of  		the original eRumor, it is believed that the two Supreme Court nominees  		mentioned were Chief Justice John G. Roberts (2005)  and Samuel A.  		Alito (2006).  Both justices were appointed by President George W.  		Bush, choices which Kennedy did not approve.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>The issue of abortion  		was the key focus in the confirmation hearing of Judge Alito.    		In his closing comments during the hearing, Senator Kennedy said, &#8220;He  		didn’t back away one inch from his view that a woman’s right to make her  		own reproductive decisions is NOT protected under the Constitution.   		He didn’t back away from his criticism of the principle of &#8216;one person,  		one vote.'&#8221;  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Kennedy added, &#8220;And on  		the cases he decided, in case after case, we see legal contortions and  		inconsistent reasoning to bend over backwards to help the powerful. He  		may cite instances in thish he thinks he helped the little guy. But the  		record is clear that the average person had a hard time getting a fair  		shake in Judge Alito’s courtroom.&#8221; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>After the death of  		William Rehnquist on September 23, 2005,  President George W. Bush  		nominated John G. Roberts to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice.  		</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font><font>During Robert&#8217;s  		confirmation hearings for Chief Justice, Senator Kennedy said, &#8221; I do  		not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to  		be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States. Sadly,  		there is ample evidence in John Roberts’ record to indicate that he  		would turn the clock back on this country’s great march of progress  		toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has refused to release  		documents and information from his years in the Reagan Administration  		and in the first Bush Administration that might indicate otherwise, but  		without those records, we have no way of knowing.&#8221; </p>
<p> 		Kennedy added, &#8220;John Roberts’s nomination are trying to force a nominee  		to adopt our “partisan” positions, to support our “causes,” to yield to  		our “special interest” agendas.&#8221;</p>
<p> 		Kennedy also said, &#8220;Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and  		consent on Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our  		most important functions. The future and the quality of life in this  		nation may literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a  		rubber stamp for the President’s nominees, if we put party over  		principle, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more  		important if we go along to get along with the White House we will be  		undermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish  		the great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and  		reasonable “no” vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the  		Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent  		consciences tell us to do so.”</font><br /><b><br /></b></font><font>Roberts attended Harvard Law  		School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review and after  		passing his bar exam, served as a law clerk for William Rehnquist.    		Roberts was confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and later  		swore into office of the President of the United States another former  		editor of the Harvard Law Review, Barack Hussein Obama.  </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font>Kennedy had a  		well-known problem with alcohol and in his earlier years was described  		by some as a “womanizer” and a “drunk.”</p>
<p> 		Biographer Edward Klein said Kennedy was “…like the playboy of the  		Western world.” Klein said that Kennedy could get attention in his  		family by being the clown. </p>
<p> 		CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller described Kennedy as a prolific  		elder statesman on one side and a brazen bad boy on the other.” She also  		said that after Kennedy’s first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in 1980,  		his reputation with women and booze spun out of control. </p>
<p> 		Klein described a drunken incident in Alaska in 1969. He said Kennedy  		began yelling “Es-ki-mo Power!” and saying things like “They’re going to  		shoot my ass off the way they shot Bobby…” After the trip John Lindsey  		of Newsweek called Kennedy family friend Lester Hyman and told him about  		the Alaska incident. He said “Your friend Ted Kennedy is in a lot of  		trouble psychologically.”</p>
<p> 		He was known for his boisterousness and loudness. He was famous for  		spontaneously bursting forth into song&#8212;and at a high volume.</p>
<p> 		In 1991, Time magazine called him a “Palm Beach Boozer” and GQ magazine  		described him as “an aging Irish boy clutching a bottle.”</p>

                </div><p><font face="Arial"> 		<font>The Last of The Kennedy Dynasty</p>
<p> 		As soon as his cancer was detected, I noticed the immediate attempt at  		the “canonization” of old Teddy Kennedy by the mainstream media. They  		are saying what a &#8220;great American&#8221; he is. I say, let&#8217;s get a couple  		things clear &amp; not twist the facts to change the real history.</p>
<p> 		1. He was caught cheating at Harvard when he attended it. He was  		expelled twice, once for cheating on a test, and once for paying a  		classmate to cheat for him.</p>
<p> 		2. While expelled, Kennedy enlisted in the Army, but mistakenly signed  		up for four years instead of two. Oops! The man can&#8217;t count to four! His  		father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England (a step up  		from bootlegging liquor into the US from Canada during prohibition),  		pulled the necessary strings to have his enlistment shortened to two  		years, and to ensure that he served in Europe, not Korea , where a war  		was raging. No preferential treatment for him! (like he charged that  		President Bush received).</p>
<p> 		3. Kennedy was assigned to Paris , never advanced beyond the rank of  		Private, and returned to Harvard upon being discharged. Imagine a person  		of his &#8220;education&#8221; NEVER advancing past the rank of Private!</p>
<p> 		4. While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was  		cited for reckless driving four times, including once when he was  		clocked driving 90 miles per hour in a residential neighborhood with his  		headlights off after dark. Yet his Virginia driver&#8217;s license was never  		revoked. Coincidentally, he passed the bar exam in 1959. Amazing!</p>
<p> 		5. In 1964, he was seriously injured in a plane crash, and hospitalized  		for several months.. Test results done by the hospital at the time he  		was admitted had shown he was legally intoxicated. The results of those  		tests remained a &#8220;state secret&#8221; until in the 1980&#8217;s when the report was  		unsealed. Didn&#8217;t hear about that from the unbiased media, did we?</p>
<p> 		6. On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island  		in Massachusetts . At about 11:00 PM, he borrowed his chauffeur&#8217;s keys  		to his Oldsmobile limousine, and offered to give a ride home to Mary Jo  		Kopechne, a campaign worker. Leaving the island via an unlit bridge with  		no guard rail, Kennedy steered the car off the bridge, flipped, and into  		Poucha Pond.</p>
<p> 		7. He swam to shore and walked back to the party, passing several houses  		and a fire station. Two friends then returned with him to the scene of  		the accident. According to their later testimony, they told him what he  		already knew &#8211; that he was required by law to immediately report the  		accident to the authorities. Instead Kennedy made his way to his hotel,  		called his lawyer, and went to sleep. Kennedy called the police the next  		morning and by then the wreck had already been discovered. Before dying,  		Kopechne had scratched at the upholstered floor above her head in the  		upside-down car. </p>
<p> 		The Kennedy family began &#8220;calling in favors&#8221;, ensuring that any inquiry  		would be contained. Her corpse was whisked out-of-state to her family,  		before an autopsy could be conducted. Further details are uncertain, but  		after the accident Kennedy says he repeatedly dove under the water  		trying to rescue Kopechne and he didn&#8217;t call police because he<br /> 		was in a state of shock. It is widely assumed Kennedy was drunk, and he  		held off calling police in hopes that his family could fix the problem  		overnight. Since the accident, Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;political enemies&#8221; have  		referred to him as the distinguished Senator from Chappaquiddick. He  		pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident, and was given a  		SUSPENDED SENTENCE OF TWO MONTHS. Kopechne&#8217;s family received a small  		payout from the Kennedy&#8217;s insurance policy, and never sued. There was  		later an effort to have her body exhumed and autopsied, but her family  		successfully fought against this in court, and Kennedy&#8217;s family paid  		their attorney&#8217;s bills&#8230; a &#8220;token of friendship&#8221;?</p>
<p> 		8. Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years, but  		considering his longevity, his accomplishments seem scant. He authored  		or argued for legislation that ensured a variety of civil rights,  		increased the minimum wage in 1981, made access to health care easier  		for the indigent, and funded Meals on Wheels for fixed-income seniors  		and is widely held as the &#8220;standard-bearer for liberalism&#8221;. In his very  		first Senate roll, he was the floor manager for the bill that turned  		U.S. immigration policy upside down and opened the floodgate for  		immigrants from third world countries.</p>
<p> 		9. Since that time, he has been the prime instigator and author of every  		expansion of an increase in immigration, up to and including the latest  		attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Not to mention the pious  		grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court nominees, as if he was the  		standard bearer for the nation in matters of “what’s right”. What a  		pompous ass!</p>
<p> 		10. He is known around Washington as a public drunk, loud, boisterous  		and very disrespectful to ladies. JERK is a better description than  		&#8220;great American&#8221;. “A blonde in every pond” is his motto.</p>
<p> 		Let&#8217;s not allow the spin doctors make this jerk a hero &#8212; how quickly  		the American public forgets what his real legacy is. Let’s keep this  		going for truth, justice and the American way!</font></p>
