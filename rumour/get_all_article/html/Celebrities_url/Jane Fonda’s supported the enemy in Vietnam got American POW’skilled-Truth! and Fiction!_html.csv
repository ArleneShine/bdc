<p> 	It quotes a POW named Jerry Driscoll who was taken       from his prison cell, cleaned and dressed for a visit with Fonda, then       ordered to give Fonda a positive account of his treatment.           He spit       at Fonda and was beaten and dragged away.   Then a group of POWs which       included a Col. Larry Carrigan were brought out to visit with Fonda.        According to the story, </font><font color="#000000"> </font> 	<font>&#8220;&#8230;she           walked the line, shaking each man&#8217;s hand and asking little encouraging           snippets like: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you sorry you bombed babies?&#8221; &amp;           &#8220;Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent           captors?&#8221;   Many of the POW&#8217;s were listed as missing in           action so to identify themselves to American authorities, they each           wrote their Social Security numbers on small pieces of paper and           slipped them to Fonda as she greeted them.   To their horror,           however, after Fonda finished meeting them, she turned to the North           Vietnamese commanding officer and handed him the POW&#8217;s pieces of           paper.   In the beatings that followed, three American POW&#8217;s died           and Col. Carrigan nearly died.            The email then ends with a statement about events in North           Vietnam from an unnamed American POW.</font></font> 	</p>

<p><b>The Truth:</b></p>
<p>  <br /><font>February 16, 2013 Update:</font> 	</b><font> This rumor has once again gone viral with  	the news of a film where actress Jane Fonda will be portraying the role of  	Nancy Reagan.    The film is called  <i> 	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327773/">The Butler</a></i>  	and is about a man who served as a butler under 8 U.S. Presidents in the  	White House.  At this time it is still in the post production stage and  	no release date has been issued.  </font></p>
<p align="justify"> 	 	 	 	 	<b> <br /></b></p>
<p></font><font><b>October 7, 2010 Update:</b> A  	version of this eRumor have begun circulating in 2010 saying that President  	Obama is honoring Jane Fonda.  This version has been circulating since  	2009 and is pretty much a carbon copy of the original Barbara Walters  	eRumor. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://8295-presscdn-0-5-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fondapic2.jpg" width="253" height="176" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="7"/>This       story hearkens to a real visit to North Vietnam by Jane Fonda in July of 1972, but           the stories about betraying POWs is not true.</p>
<p>The Fonda trip became       unforgettable because it infuriated Americans, especially Americans in       uniform, many of whom still regard her as a traitor.  She praised the       North Vietnamese, posed for a photo at a Communist anti-aircraft gun       emplacement, made several radio broadcasts for the Communist North       Vietnamese in which she called American military leaders &#8220;war       criminals,&#8221; then when some of the POWs returned home and described       mistreatment by the North Vietnamese, she said Americans should &#8220;&#8230;not       hail the POWs as heroes, because they are hypocrites and       liars.&#8221;<br />  <br />There is no dispute that her visit took place and that her       words and actions were in support of the enemy.  This particular email includes three stories, two of which have been       denied by the POWs who are named, and one of which has been confirmed as       true by the source, although he was not named in the email.</p>
<p>First, the &#8220;100 Women of the Century&#8221; was a project of the       Ladies Home Journal and a TV special hosted by Barbara Walters that aired  	April 30, 1999.  Jane       Fonda was one of the 100. How the email story about the POWs got started is not known, but it has       been widely circulated.   </p>
<p></font><font><font>TruthOrFiction.com located Jerry Driscoll who said that the accounts       about him in the email are &#8220;&#8230;the       product of a very vivid imagination&#8221; and       he requests that people please stop passing it on to others.</font></p>
<p><font>TruthOrFiction.com also contacted Mike       McGrath, of Nam-POWs, who says the Larry Carrigan events never       happened either.  He says Carrigan calls the story a &#8220;hoax&#8221;       and does not want to be associated with it.  McGrath also says that       some versions of the email include an account from a Dave Hoffman and that       his story is true.  Hoffman says he was tortured (hung by a broken       arm) until he agreed to go before Jane Fonda.  He was among a small       group who witnessed one of her radio broadcasts for Hanoi.  The part of the email that begins with &#8220;To Whom it may concern&#8221;       is true.  It&#8217;s a quote from an article titled SHAME ON JANE       originally published on the Advocacy And Intelligence Index website on       April 28, 1999 and written by Michael Benge who was a civilian captured by the North       Vietnamese in 1968.  In his statement, he also makes reference to a       missionary nurse who died in captivity.  For your interest, that was       Betty Olsen, a Christian Missionary Alliance nurse from New York.</p>
<p>In 1988 in an interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, Jane Fonda talked       about her Vietnam visit and issued what some feel was an apology but which       her critics say was not enough.</p>
<p>Fonda said, &#8220;I would like to       say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who       were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of       the things that I said or did.  I was trying to help end the killing       and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless       about it and I&#8217;m&#8230;very sorry that I hurt them.  And I want to       apologize to them and their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2005, Fonda published her autobiography in which she described in           detail her decision to go to North Vietnam. She said it was primarily motivated by her desire to document the U.S.           bombing of important dikes that, if destroyed, could kill tens of           thousands of people and devastate the lives of millions.  The U.S. had denied the bombings.           In the book, Fonda is unapologetic about the trip or her participation           in broadcasts on radio Hanoi but regrets the pictures taken of her at           the gun emplacement.  She said it made it appear as though she was celebrating armaments           aimed at American planes, which was not how she felt and was not the           context in which the pictures were taken.  She reminds readers that the U.S. investigated her trip and found no           reason to bring any charges against her.  She also describes her longstanding support of, and interaction with, U.S.           military personnel and says her only beef was with the U.S.           government, not the troops.</p>

<p align="justify"><font>BY BARBRA WALTERS WRITES:</p>
<p> 	Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never  	known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific  	men who served and sacrificed during Vietnam </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>The first part of this is from an F-4E  	pilot. The pilot&#8217;s name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>In 1968, the former Commandant of the USAF  	Survival School was a POW in Ho Lo Prison the &#8216; Hanoi Hilton.&#8217; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Dragged from a stinking cesspit of a cell,  	cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJ&#8217;s, he was ordered to describe for a  	visiting American &#8216;Peace Activist&#8217; the &#8216;lenient and humane treatment&#8217; he&#8217;d  	received. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and was  	dragged away. During the subsequent beating, he fell forward<br /> 	on to the camp Commandant &#8216;s feet, which sent that officer berserk. </font> 	</p>
<p align="justify"><font>In 1978, the Air Force Colonel still  	suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying career) from  	the Commandant&#8217;s frenzied application of a wooden baton. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>&gt;From 1963-65, Col. Larry Carrigan was in  	the 47FW/DO (F-4E&#8217;s). He spent 6 years in the &#8216;Hanoi Hilton&#8217;,,, the first  	three of which his family only knew he was &#8216;missing in action&#8217;. His wife  	lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the cleaned-up,  	fed and clothed routine in preparation for a &#8216;peace delegation&#8217; visit. 	</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>They, however, had time and devised a plan  	to get word to the world that they were alive and still survived. Each man  	secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his Social Security Number on it , in  	the palm of his hand. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a  	cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man&#8217;s hand and asking little  	encouraging snippets like: &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you sorry you bombed babies?&#8217; and &#8216;Are  	you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?&#8217;  	Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of paper. 	</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>She took them all without missing a beat..  	At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the shocked  	disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and handed him  	all the little pieces of paper.. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Three men died from the subsequent  	beatings. Colonel Carrigan was almost number four but he survived, which is  	the only reason we know of her actions that day. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>I was a civilian economic development  	advisor in Vietnam , and was captured by the North Vietnamese communists in  	South Vietnam in 1968, and held prisoner for over 5 years. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>I spent 27 months in solitary confinement;  	one year in a cage in Cambodia ; and one year in a &#8216;black box&#8217; in Hanoi My  	North Vietnamese captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female  	missionary, a nurse in a leprosarium in Ban me Thuot , South Vietnam , whom  	I buried in the jungle near the Cambodian border. At one time, I weighed  	only about 90 lbs. (My normal weight is 170 lbs) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>We were Jane Fonda&#8217;s &#8216;war criminals&#8230;.&#8217; 	</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi , I was asked  	by the camp communist political officer if I would be willing to meet with  	her.. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>I said yes, for I wanted to tell her about  	the real treatment we POWs received&#8230; and how different it was from the  	treatment purported by the North Vietnamese, and parroted by her as &#8216;humane  	and lenient.&#8217; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>Because of this, I spent three days on a  	rocky floor on my knees, with my arms outstretched with a large steel  	weights placed on my hands, and beaten with a bamboo cane. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font>I had the opportunity to meet with Jane  	Fonda soon after I was released. I asked her if she would be willing to  	debate me on TV. She never did answer me. </font></p>

<p></b>Subject: Honored Women of the Century </p>
<p>  A good friend of mine knows the author of the following and asked to have it<br />       forwarded to my contacts that are different from his. I&#8217;m sure there are<br />       dozens of accounts that are just as compelling about Hanoi Jane but this one<br />       is pretty strong. Please consider forwarding this to others that you know well and are comfortable that they will not feel spammed. _______________________________________________<br />       HANOI JANE<br />       Looks like Hanoi Jane may be honored as one of the &#8220;100 Women of the Century&#8221;. </p>
<p>  JANE FONDA remembered? </p>
<p>  Unfortunately many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our &#8220;country&#8221; but the men who served and sacrificed during Vietnam. There are few things I have strong visceral reactions to, but Jane Fonda&#8217;s participation in what I believe to be blatant treason, is one of them.</p>
<p>       Part of my conviction comes from exposure to a pilot whose name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat. In 1978, the Commandant of the USAF Survival School was a former POW in Ho Lo Prison-the &#8220;Hanoi Hilton&#8221;. Dragged from a stinking<br />       cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in fresh PJs, he was ordered to<br />       describe for a visiting American &#8220;Peace Activist&#8221; the &#8220;lenient and humane<br />       treatment&#8221; he&#8217;d received. He spat at Ms.Fonda, was clubbed and dragged away.</p>
<p>       During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp Commandant&#8217;s<br />       feet, accidentally pulling the man&#8217;s shoe off-which sent that officer berserk. In &#8217;78, the AF Col.still suffered from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the Vietnamese Col.&#8217;s frenzied application of wooden baton.</p>
<p>       From 1983-85, Col. Larry Carrigan was the 47FW/DO (F-4Es). He spent 6 years in the &#8220;Hilton&#8221; &#8211; the first three of which he was &#8220;missing in action&#8221;.        His wife lived on faith that he was still alive.

<p>       She took them all without missing a beat.

Three men died from the subsequent beatings. Col. Carrigan was almost number four.</p>
<p>       To whom it may concern: I was a civilian economic development advisor in Viet Nam, was captured by the North Vietnamese communists in South Viet Nam in       1968, and held for over 5 years. I spent 27 months in solitary confinement, one year in a cage in Cambodia, and one year in a &#8220;black box&#8221; in Hanoi.        My North Vietnamese captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female missionary, a nurse in a leprosarium in Ban me       Thuot, South Vietnam, whom I buried in the jungle near the Cambodian border.

I asked her if she would be willing to debate me on TV. She declined to answer me. She does not exemplify someone who should be honored among &#8220;100 Years of Great Women.&#8221;</p>
