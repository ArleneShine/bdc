"Facebook Donates $3 to Rose Prater Every Time a Photo is Shared-Fiction!","2015-08-07 10:45:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-donates-3-to-rose-prater-every-time-a-photo-is-shared/"," Facebook will donate $3 to Rose Prater, a baby girl who suffered severe burns, every time a photo of her is shared. "," This scam has been around for a long time. A post claims Facebook will donate $3 to Rose Prater every time that a photo of the badly burned baby girl is shared, but that’s not true. First, the baby girl shown in the photo isn’t named Rose Prater. Her name is Ola Kuchma, and she was burned in a 2005 fire at her home in Poland. Ola survived thanks to donations made to her family, but scammers immediately latched onto the tragedy, according to a Polish news report . Scammers first used email campaigns to steal donations from Ola’s family. Then the scam spilled onto social media. Early versions of the Facebook scam said the baby’s name was Alexandra. Later, her name was changed to Rose Prater. This type of scam has become known as a “sick children hoax.” Users are shown a heart-wrenching photo of a sick or injured child and are told that donations will be made every time it’s liked or shared. In reality, Facebook never donates money to a cause based on the number of times a post is shared or liked, according to the website : People are exploiting these children by spreading their photos without the parents consent. Please do not share the photos – report them instead! Please share with your friends to raise awareness on this issue. What do the scammers get out of sick children hoaxes? They are sometimes a clickjacking scam : Clickjacking, also known as a “UI redress attack”, is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page. Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. These type of scams can also be used to hack into Facebook accounts so that scammers can post spam and advertisements from your profile. ","Pleas"

"," This story is true but Amina Lawal’s sentence was overturned and she was freed to live her life and rear her child.and Oprah Winfrey has rallied to her aid. Amina Lawal was at the time of the trial a 30-year-old divorced woman who was said to have confessed to conceiving a child while single.  She was sentenced to death by stoning in March, 2002 in Katsina state under a new law that considers pregnancy outside of marriage as grounds for being convicted of adultery.  According to Amnesty International, she had no lawyer during the trial that resulted in her conviction and sentencing. With the help of attorneys from human rights organizations her case was appealed.  One appeal in August, 2002, upheld her sentence. The alleged father of the child denied having had sex with her and was released.  Aminal Lawal gave birth to her child and her sentence was supposed to be carried out once the baby was weaned.

"Collect Pop tabs from soda cans for charity-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/poptabs/"," There are various eRumors about fund-raising projects that involve collecting and recycling pop-tabs from soft drink cans. "," There isn’t any way of classifying all of the tab collection projects as Truth! or Fiction! It is best to check with the charity that is named in the email to confirm the story. Since pop tabs are aluminum and can be recycled, there are fund-raising projects that collect them and donate the proceeds to charity. One charity told us that a truckload of cans yields about $10 at the recycler while a truckload of tabs yields about $1,000. It seems to depend, however, on which recycling company you’re dealing with.  Some of them don’t accept tabs for recycling. The reason there is any question about pop tab projects, however, is that one of the oldest and most widely circulated urban legends involves the alleged collection of pop tabs to be donated to the National Kidney Foundation for helping pay for dialysis treatments for kidney patients. The National Kidney Foundation says it does not have, and has never had, a pop-tab collection project and that it isn’t really needed since, at the moment, Medicare typically pays for 80 percent of the cost of dialysis time, regardless of the age of the patient. Private insurance and state programs usually pay for the remaining 20 percent. There are some pop tab projects, however, and some have done well. Tabs for Wheelchairs, a successful effort in Canada, actually got started because of an urban legend. TruthOrFiction.com spoke with Jack Baumber of the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 229 in Elora, Ontario, Canada. He has led a tab collection effort since 1989 that has donated more than 400 wheelchairs to people who need them. He says it all got started when he heard that tabs were being collected to provide a wheelchair for a 4-year-old girl. He and others accumulated some tabs, only to find out that the whole thing was a rumor and there was no such project. He decided to see how much the tabs they had collected were worth at a recycling plant and that inspired him to turn the rumor into reality. He says he gets tabs from all over the world. There are also some Ronald McDonald houses that conduct pop tab collection campaigns. updated 11/20/01 ","Pleas"

"Help the Victims of the Tsunami","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamirelief/"," Various emails asking for support for victims of the tsunami waves in South Asia. "," The devastating tsunamis in South       Asia have prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support from       people around the world who want to help those who have been       affected by them. TruthOrFiction.com has had a lot of experience with humanitarian       relief efforts and we have some recommendations that will help       ensure that the support you give will go to the people who need it. 1.  If you get an email requesting donations for tsunami       victims, don’t respond directly to the email or any links in the       email, even if it seems to be from a trusted organization. The reason is that you may get an email from crooks who merely       want to capture your personal information including your credit       card. The safest thing to do is to go directly to the website of the       organization or call them by phone. If you don’t know the web address, use Google or some other search       engine to find it. 2.  Donate only to trusted organizations who have a       reputation for doing the kind of work that you believe in and,       preferably, already work in the areas affected by the tsunamis. This is a biggie. A disaster of this proportion inspires us all to want to help. One of the difficulties, however, is that well-meaning people and       organizations start grass-roots efforts that either don’t help or,       in some cases, inadvertently end up being a hindrance. That’s why it’s best in the long-run to simply donate to       organizations that are already there, that do this on a regular       basis, that have personnel at the scene, that have the best channels       for receiving and distributing the aid, and that know exactly what       the needs are. Even as I write this, there are campaigns in various cities to       collect food, clothing, diapers, blankets, and other supplies, but       the chances for those goods actually getting to the people who need       them are poor. It is heartbreaking to be on the scene of a disaster and know that       there are airplanes that cannot land because nobody was expecting       them, goods being stockpiled at an airport or a dock because there       is no arrangement for being able to distribute them, and tons of       supplies that are either not helpful to the relief effort or, if       they are, will have to be sorted and there is not enough personnel       or time to do that. Another sad reality of disaster relief efforts is that not all       government officials in all countries are honest and unless supplies       are coming into the area through trusted sources, there is the       danger for much of it to end up in the hands of unscrupulous people       or end up on the black market. One of the truths about human suffering is that many of the areas of       the world  where there is the greatest need are areas where       there is the least concern on the part of the government for the       people being served. In some countries, the danger is not from the government, but from       insurgents and competing political groups that may have control over       a particular portion of the nation. The bottom line is that we all need to help but we also need to make       sure that our help will get to the people who need it.","Pleas"

"," This story is true. Target stores informed the Salvation Army that for the first time, the Salvation Army solicitors will not be allowed in front of Target stores during the 2004 holiday season. Salvation Army bell ringers, the “Sharing is Caring” message, and the familiar red kettles for taking contributions have been a tradition in front of retail stores for a century. In a news release, Target said the decision was to avoid showing favoritism in the face of solicitation or donation requests from a large number of organizations. The Salvation Army says it’s a blow to them because Target locations produced $9 million in donations the previous year. Update! In late 2005 it was announced on the Salvation Army website that Target and the Salvation Army were partnering together on the “Target/Salvation Army Wish List” an online site to provide items for those affected by the hurricanes and other people in need. The Boston Globe looked into the 2004 red kettle campaign and found that there is a bit of a schism between retailers. Some of them, including Target and BestBuy, are banning the bell ringers both because of competing requests and because of customers who don’t like them. But others, such as Wal-Mart, Big Lots, Autozone and Books-A-Million, are welcoming the Salvation Army and the civic-minded reputation they feel accompanies it. The Salvation Army was founded in England by William Booth who felt a calling to serve the totality of those in need…spiritual, physical, and material. The Salvation Army is an international relief ministry that provides personal help, housing, family services, and disaster services in numerous parts of the world. The red kettle tradition for the Salvation Army got started in 1891 in San Francisco. The local Salvation Army captain, Joseph McFee,  had promised himself to provide a free Christmas dinner for the poor. To help pay for it, he hearkened to his memories as a sailor in England where there was what was called a “Simpson’s Pot” at a stage landing into which passersby tossed coins to support charitable causes. He got permission to put a kettle at the Oakland ferry landing…and the tradition spread from there to around the world. Updated 11/23/04 ","Pleas"

"Help the Victims of Hurricane Katrina","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricanerelief/"," Various emails asking for support for victims of Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast of the United States. "," The devastation of hurricane Katrina       has prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support from       people who want to help those who have been       affected. TruthOrFiction.com has had a lot of experience with humanitarian       relief efforts and we have some recommendations that will help       ensure that the support you give will go to the people who need it. 1.  If you get an email requesting donations for hurricane victims, don’t respond directly to the email or any links in the       email, even if it seems to be from a trusted organization. The reason is that you may get an email from crooks who merely       want to capture your personal information including your credit       card. The safest thing to do is to go directly to the website of the       organization or call them by phone. If you don’t know the web address, use Google or some other search       engine to find it. 2.  Donate only to trusted organizations who have a       reputation for doing the kind of work that you believe in and,       preferably, already work in the areas affected by the hurricane. This is a biggie. A disaster of this proportion inspires us all to want to help. One of the difficulties, however, is that well-meaning people and       organizations start grass-roots efforts that either don’t help or,       in some cases, inadvertently end up being a hindrance. That’s why it’s best in the long-run to simply donate to       organizations that are already there, that do this on a regular       basis, that have personnel at the scene, that have the best channels       for receiving and distributing the aid, and that know exactly what       the needs are. Even as I write this, there are campaigns in various cities to       collect food, clothing, diapers, blankets, and other supplies, but       the chances for those goods actually getting to the people who need       them are poor. It is heartbreaking to be on the scene of a disaster and know that       there are airplanes that cannot land because nobody was expecting       them, goods being stockpiled at an airport or a dock because there       is no arrangement for being able to distribute them, and tons of       supplies that are either not helpful to the relief effort or, if       they are, will have to be sorted and there is not enough personnel       or time to do that. The bottom line is that we all need to help but we also need to make       sure that our help will get to the people who need it.","Pleas"

"Boycott gas stations to protest rising fuel prices?-Grass Roots Effort& Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fuelprotest/"," The email says that it’s been calculated that if everyone in the United States would avoid buying gasoline for just one day, the oil companies would “choke” on their stockpiles.  It encourages a boycott of oil companies to protest high gas prices.  The latest version called for a boycott on May 15, 2007.  Some versions reference similar campaigns that allegedly took place in other years, such as 1997 and 1999 or “last year.” . "," This eRumor in various forms has popped up every few months for several years, especially in the Spring. The email has not been effective, however, and was not in when tried before. There has not ever been a grass-roots effort like this that has ever had an impact on the oil and gas industry or on gas prices. John Ballard, vice president of retail marketing for Holland Oil, which owns 55 Northeast Ohio stations told the Akron Beacon Journal it was kind of an average day after the call for a protest on May 19, 2004.  The Orange County Register in California did a survey of gas stations at the same time and did not find any that noticed a drop in sales.  One station owner said he’d never seen a boycott have any impact.  It was the same in Alabama, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and many other states. The experts say there are several reasons that the boycotts don’t work. F irst, it was a grass-roots effort originated by someone who apparently thought it would be a nifty idea but did not have the muscle to accomplish the goal of a national boycott.  In other words, it wouldn’t have recruited enough people. Second, it was based on a flawed assumption.  The eRumor said, “It has been calculated that if everyone in the United States did not purchase a drop of gasoline for one day…the oil companies would choke on their stockpiles.”  No such calculation was been announced that we can find.  It was apparently the fabrication of whoever originated the email. We’ve talked with representatives of the oil industry who say that a one-day boycott of gas stations would not really accomplish much because those who decided not to buy gas on that day would still presumably need gas within several days.  The sales for a given week or month would probably end up being the same. University of Michigan economics professor Stephen Salant told Detroit Free Press columnist Matt Helms that it was hard to think of anything less effective than the suggested one-day boycott. Also, the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C., said that oil inventories were on the low side for that  time of year in 2004, so there were no stockpiles to choke. Most of the boycott emails focused on trying to influence the Middle East, but the American Petroleum Institute says that two of the largest suppliers of crude oil to the United States are our neighbors Canada and Mexico.

"Senate Bill seeks to regulate “grass roots” lobbying-Truth! But Overturned!","2015-03-17 20:39:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lobbyists/"," An alert from the American Family Association (AFA) that says that a new bill (Senate Bill 1, Section 220) will “…effectively keep AFA and every other pro-family organization in America from providing you information on bills in Congress.” "," On January 18, 2007, senators removed language from a lobby reform bill that was opposed by numerous citizens organizations ranging from Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family to the American Civil Liberties Union. The legislation in Senate Bill 1, section 220, was part of what was being called the Lobby Reform Bill. It proposed changes regarding what lobbyists are required to disclose and how often.  It didn’t target any particular types of organizations, such as pro-life or pro-family, but a part of the bill, section 220, was about lobbyists who become involved in so called grassroots campaigns such as appealing to the general public to support or oppose legislation and to tell members of congress how they feel about it. Opponents of the legislation said it was an attempt to silence grassroots campaigns by putting reporting requirements on them that will cost a lot of time and money to implement.  They said, for example, that under the legislation any small group that sent out communication to more than 500 people will be required to register as a lobbying group and be subject to the reporting regulations.  Joining the American Family Association was Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the Family in expressing alarm about section 220.  In a statement released to its constituents, Focus on the Family said, “If S.1 passes with these outrageous provisions, communications from Focus Action, known as ‘grassroots communications,’ will be tied up in miles of new red tape. These bureaucratic restrictions are clearly a concerted effort to insulate legislators from criticism. At the same time, Section 220 will allow labor unions, trade associations and foreign corporations unregulated access to legislators. ”  The bill exempts organizations that are communicating directly with members, such as a labor union. Supporters of the bill, however, said that the reporting requirements apply only to organizations and lobbyists who were already required to register and who were spending a lot of money on lobbying activities.  In other words, it targeted the big lobbyists.  However, if an organization spent more than $24,500 semi-annually on direct lobbying activities, it would have been required to register as a lobbying entity and report on any grass roots activity as well.  So the mere sending of 500 communications would not have require an entity to register as a lobbyist and report on grass roots activities, but larger organizations like AFA and Focus on the Family would probably have had to register, which worried them. In an unusual alliance, one of the organizations that joined in opposition to section 220 was the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The provisions of section 220 are identical to legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate last March, which the ACLU encouraged its members to reject. “The right to petition the government is “one of the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,” the ACLU said in a statement.  “When viewed through this prism, the thrust of the grassroots lobbying regulation is at best misguided, and at worst would seriously undermine the basic freedom that is the cornerstone of our system of government.” Updated 1/18/07 ","Pleas"

There is not agreement, however, about whether the dog was mistreated and died as a result of Vargas exhibit. Vargas said that the display at the Codice Gallery in August, 2007, was intended to give tribute to a man named Natividad Canada, a 24-year-old Nicaraguan who died in a Costa Rican factory after being attacked by two Rottweiler dogs in 2005.  The exhibit also reportedly included the words “You Are What You Read” written with dog food, a recording of the Sandinista National Anthem playing backwards, and a censer in which burned “175 rocks of crack cocaine and an ounce of marijuana.”. Vargas said he got the dog, which he named “Natividad,” from the streets of Nicaragua. Circulated emails, blogs, petitions, and websites say the dog was already starved from living on the streets then was denied food and water during the exhibition and died as a result. An article from Costa Rica’s La Nacion newspaper in October, 2007, said the dog died after the first day and that the death was confirmed by Marta Leonor Gonzalez, editor of the cultural supplement of La Prensa in Nicaragua. A news release from the gallery, however, told a different story.  Jaunita Bermudez, the director of the gallery, said the dog was at the exhibit for three days beginning Wednesday, August 15, 2007.  She said that he was allowed to run free in an inner patio except for three hours per day when the dog was on exhibit.  She also said that the dog was given water and food that was brought by the artist himself.  Bermudez said that the dog escaped through the main gate of the facility during the early morning hours of Friday, August 17, while a night watchman was cleaning the sidewalk outside. Lilian Schnog, president of the Humanitarian Association for the Protection of animals in Costa Rica also looked into the incident and told TruthOrFiction.com that the dog did not die at the exhibition, but escaped as reported.

"Haiti Disaster Relief Information- Alert!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/disaster-relief-haiti/"," Beware of scammers passing themselves off as relief organizations asking for donations.  They could be phishing or attempting to steal  your financial information. "," There are scammers who come to life during a time of disaster and who will try to trick us into giving money to them instead of worthy relief organizations and who will, as well, try to get our personal financial information for identity theft. Here are some important things to keep in mind: 1. Do not respond to any email appeals for funds no matter who they appear to be from. If you get an email that seems to be from the Red Cross, for example, don’t assume that it really is. The scammers are able to put a link into the email that appears to be going to the Red Cross but in reality is linking to one of their own sites. Other appeals will appear to be from particular individuals who are claiming to be victims of the disaster and asking for direct donations but who, in reality, are not. 2. Do not respond to any phone solicitations for the same reason. You do not know whether the people calling are really giving the funds to the organizations they claim to represent or whether your credit card information is being given to a trusted source. 3. The way to make a donation is to go directly to the official web site of any organizations you trust or to call them on the phone directly. If there are relief organizations that you know and trust, just do a web search such as through www.google.com and find that group’s official web site to make your contribution. 4. Avoid responding to requests for donations of clothing, tents, diapers, medicine, water, or food that are being collected to be sent to Haiti. Even if the effort is sincere, the chances of the goods getting there are very small. It is better to donate to relief organizations that are already there and buying and shipping such goods in bulk. Well meaning campaigns to collect goods to be sent to a disasater area usually result in warehouses full of things that never get there. Getting transportation of the goods is very difficult and then ensuring that even if they arrive that they won’t fall into the hands of corrupt government officials, black marketers, or thieves is very difficult. There are numerous good relief organizations, but here are some examples if you would like to make donations that you know will be helping the people of Haiti: The American Red Cross World Vision Mercy Corps has teams on the ground in Haiti Mission Aviation Fellowship has operated in Haiti for decades and provides air transportation for relief teams and supplies.

TruthOrFiction.com knew that it was probably an eRumor because the wording of the email was almost identical to two other widely circulated hoaxes about missing persons.  But the question was who is Ashley Flores, how did this eRumor get started, and who is the girl who is pictured in the eRumor? We checked with the Philadelphia police department, Acme Markets, as well as several organizations that document cases of missing children and there was no Ashley Flores. We did find pictures on social networking sites of a girl who looked similar to the one whose picture was circulated with the eRumor and who had the name Ashley Flores.  Following those leads we were able to find the person who actually created the Ashley Flores email and get a little of the background on the story.  That was an oddity because tracking down the creators of some of the biggest eRumors is usually virtually impossible. Her name is Vickie and both she and Ashley are from Philadelphia.  Vickie told TruthOrFiction.com that it all started on Myspace.com when someone posted a bulletin about a missing girl.  Vickie thought it would be fun to replace the picture and the identifying information with that of her best friend–Ashley Flores.  Vickie said she did it with Ashley’s permission and posted it just once on Myspace.  From there it jumped to forwarded emails and the rest is history.  She said she thought that both her and Ashley’s friends would get a kick out of seeing Ashley pictured as a missing person and they all got a chuckle out of it–without realizing how big this would all get. What impact has all of this had on Ashley?  Vickie said people who had not talked with Ashley for years started contacting her or dropping by her house because of the eRumor.  The police once came to Ashley’s school inquiring about her and that was when Vickie and Ashley explained that the whole thing had been an innocent joke and that nobody was really missing.  She said the police came to seek proof of that.  Vickie told us that in preparation for furthering her education, Ashley had applied to several colleges and that she heard from some of them who thought she was now missing and were wondering what was going on.

It was originally going to be launched in November, 2001, but the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in September, 2001 prompted the group to go ahead and start the ball rolling. The idea originated with Arizona sculptor William Hunter, who specializes in patriotic themes in his art.  He engraved and minted a special coin designed to be a reminder to pray for the President of the United States.  That led to the thought of mobilizing a large number of people in prayer.  The goal is to get 1% of the American population committed to regular prayer for the President, or about 2.8 million people.

"," Craig Shergold is real and in 1989 when he was 9-years old, a campaign was started on his behalf to try to break the Guinness world record for greeting cards. The Make-A-Wish Foundation had nothing to do with it, however, and Craig is now a 22-year old young man who is alive and well. The story began in 1988 when Craig first complained of earaches.  Antibiotics didn’t help and one day when his condition seemed desperate, Craig was taken to a hospital for tests, which revealed a brain tumor.  He was so ill his parents were warned he might not survive.  Surgery removed the tumor, but it kept growing and the outlook was not good.   When the staff at Royal Marsden Hospital in London saw how much get-well cards cheered it up, it was suggested that a card project be started to break the Guinness world record.  The London office of the Children’s Wish Foundation (not Make-a-Wish) got on board and the British press gave visibility to the story.  The old Guinness mark was slightly more than a million cards.  That record was broken by Craig within a few months, but the cards kept coming.  Then along the way, the rumor said he wanted business cards, not greeting cards.  The mail load got so heavy that Craig’s family ultimately halted mail delivery to their home and chose to move to a different residence.  Now, Craig’s old address has its own postal code and more than 350 million pieces of mail have been received.  Volunteers remove the stamps, which are sold, and the mail is then recycled, with the proceeds going to cancer research.  The folks at Guinness have retired the greeting card category. Although Craig and his family became overwhelmed by the volume of mail, they ultimately became grateful for one aspect of the visibility.  Word of Craig’s condition reached Virginia billionaire John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia.  He arranged for Craig to be flown to the U.S. for life-saving surgery at the University of Virginia Medical Center. A PAX-TV movie about Craig was the result of producer Robert Woods having received the rumor and sending a card to Craig.  Through that, he learned that Craig was no longer a little boy, but a healthy young man and the story struck him as a good one for the screen.  He and the family have hopes that the film will help quiet the rumor. updated 11/18/01 For more information: Make A Wish Foundation ","Pleas"

"," No such petition has ever been presented to the FCC by Madalyn Murray O’Hair or her organization of American atheists.  In fact, this eRumor is more than 20 years old and has produced more mail response to the FCC than anything in its history. An interesting twist is that Madalyn Murray O’Hair has been out of the picture since she disappeared in August, 1995.  In January, 2001, authorities in Texas found her remains in a shallow grave and the question then became what would happen to the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors?  We got our answer less than a month later when we started receiving versions of the rumors that began with, “THOUGH SHE’S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE. – GET THIS:”  So, it looks like the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors will survive for a while. One of the reasons this FCC rumor is so believable is that Madalyn Murray O’Hair shocked the nation more than two decades ago by participating in legal action that resulted in the United States Supreme Court decision pulling prayer and Bible reading out of the classrooms in public schools. There is a petition RM-2493, but it was filed by a couple of fellows who felt that churches and religious organizations should not be operating so many FM radio frequencies that are classed as “educational.”  They asked the FCC to take several actions including freezing all new applications from religious organizations seeking educational frequencies and regulating the content of religiously operated stations.  This prompted religious broadcasters to ask for public response to the FCC on the matter and the FCC eventually issued a ruling that was favorable to the religious broadcasters. Another version of this eRumor warns that O’Hair is trying to remove references to God on the television program “Touched By an Angel.” Click here for those details. ","Pleas"
