"Marine Col. Jeffery Powers Letter to NFL Commissioner-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-12-15 09:56:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/marine-col-jeffery-powers-letter-to-nfl-commissioner/"," Retired U.S. Marine Colonel Jeffrey A. Powers wrote a letter the NFL commissioner about players kneeling in protest during the playing of the national anthem. "," Major Colonel Jeffrey A. Powers’ wrote an open letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell about the NFL’s handling of player protests during the national anthem. The letter first appeared on discussion forums and veteran email groups. Then, Colonel Jeffrey Powers’ letter to the NFL commissioner started to go viral in September 2016 after Allen B. West, a former congressman and current outspoken conservative, posted it on his website. The letter opens by Powers recalling how he missed the start of the 1990-1991 football season because he was serving with a battalion of Marines in Operation Desert Storm. Ultimately, 14 of Powers’ fellow Marines “returned home with the American flag draped across their lifeless bodies,” Powers wrote, and the last conversations he had with one of those fallen Marines was about the New York Giants: Many friends, Marines, and Special Forces Soldiers who worked with or for me through the years returned home with the American Flag draped over their coffins. Now I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game, disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for. They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men, men who have actually done something for this country beside playing with a ball and believing they’re something special! They’re not! My Marines and Soldiers were! Powers goes on to write that the NFL commissioner is complicit in the protests because he’s happy to fine them for “small infractions” but lacks the “moral courage and respect” to put an immediate stop to the player protests: I observed a player getting a personal foul for twerking in the end zone after scoring. I guess that’s much worse than disrespecting the flag and our National Anthem. Hmmmmm, isn’t it his 1st Amendment right to express himself like an idiot in the end zone? Why is taunting not allowed yet taunting America is OK? You fine players for wearing 9-11 commemorative shoes yet you allow scum on the sidelines to sit, kneel or pump their pathetic fist in the air. They are so deprived with their multi-million dollar contracts for playing a freaking game! You condone it all by your refusal to act. You’re just as bad and disgusting as they are. I hope Americans boycott any sponsor who supports that rabble you call the NFL. I hope they turn off the TV when any team that allowed this disrespect to occur, without consequence, on the sidelines. I applaud those who have not. Powers concludes his letter to the NFL commissioner by hoping that the NFL’s “high paid protesting pretty boys and (Goodell) look in the mirror” and see who they really are. While we weren’t able to track down where the letter was first published, many of the biographical details in Colonel Jeffrey Powers’ biography match up. Powers is a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and commanded a 1,200-man Task Force in Saudi Arabia as part of the lead contingent of Operation Desert Shield, according to his bio at Bloomberg Business: He was decorated for valor while serving as Operations Officer for the lead Task Force into Kuwait. He retired from the U.S. Marine Corps achieving the rank of Colonel. He held command assignments in Marine reconnaissance, light armor reconnaissance, a Dutch Marine rifle company, a U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Beret) training company, as well as an Officer in charge of Special Operations Training Group for the Marines on the west coast. He served as an Analyst for the U.S. Army’s Future Combat Systems at Boeing. He served as Chief Executive Officer of Domestic Energy Corp. until March 2008. Mr. Powers served as an Executive Officer of Eyemakers, Inc. He has been Chairman and Director of Homeland Security Technology Inc., since October 1, 2004. Colonel Powers is a graduate of Villanova University with a B.A. in Criminal Justice, an M.S. in Urban and Environmental Studies from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an M.A. in National Security and Strategic Studies, Naval Warfare College, Newport, RI. Given all that, we’re confirming the authorship of Colonel Jeffrey A. Powers’ letter to the NFL commissioner. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Boy Dies in Santa’s Arms-Investigation Pending!","2016-12-14 07:34:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/boy-dies-santas-arms/"," A terminally ill boy died in Santa’s arms after asking to see him one last time. "," The Knoxville News-Sentinel first reported the story of a five-year-old boy dying in a column appearing under the headline “Santa’s Grant’s a Final Wish” on December 12th. The story, which was written by a columnist named Sam Venable, tells the story of five-year-old boy dying in Santa’s arms . Eric Schmitt-Matzen, the Santa impersonator, said it all began when he got a call from a friend at a local hospital that a dying five-year-old boy’s last wish was to see Santa: “When I walked in, he was laying there, so weak it looked like he was ready to fall asleep. I sat down on his bed and asked, ‘Say, what’s this I hear about you’re gonna miss Christmas? There’s no way you can miss Christmas! Why, you’re my Number One elf! “He looked up and said, ‘I am?’ “I said, ‘Sure!’ “I gave him the present. He was so weak he could barely open the wrapping paper. When he saw what was inside, he flashed a big smile and laid his head back down. ‘“They say I’m gonna die,’ he told me. ‘How can I tell when I get to where I’m going?’ “I said, ‘Can you do me a big favor?’ “He said, ‘Sure!’ “When you get there, you tell ’em you’re Santa’s Number One elf, and I know they’ll let you in. “He said, ‘They will?’ “I said, ‘Sure!’ “He kinda sat up and gave me a big hug and asked one more question: ‘Santa, can you help me?’ “I wrapped my arms around him. Before I could say anything, he died right there. I let him stay, just kept hugging and holding on to him. “Everyone outside the room realized what happened. His mother ran in. She was screaming, ‘No, no, not yet!’ I handed her son back and left as fast as I could. USA Today and Fox News picked up the story, and media outlets around the world quickly followed suite. But key details from the story of a boy dying in Santa’s arms haven’t been independently confirmed. The boy hasn’t been identified, and his family hasn’t come forward. The hospital that this supposedly happened in hasn’t been identified, either. Sam Venable said he heard about Santa granting a dying boy’s last wish from an old high school friend — but he hasn’t explained how (or if) he vetted Eric Schmitt-Matzen’s story. Venable said he was surprised how big the story had gotten: In some respects I’m surprised how big it ballooned, naturally. You got a Santa Claus story at Christmas you know you’re going to get some mileage out of it … I had absolutely no idea. I contacted (Eric) today after I realized what was going on, and I said ‘Eric you better be ready, they’re coming,’ and he said ‘they already are,’ and he had three interviews set up….” Right now, the story is based entirely on Schmitt-Matzen’s account and it’s been re-reported without key elements being independently verified. We’re trying to confirm the boy’s name and the hospital where he died. Our investigation is ongoing, so check back for updates. . ","9-11 Attack on America"
"GOP Plans to Cut Social Security-Reported as Fiction!","2016-12-12 11:22:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gop-plans-cut-social-security/"," GOP leaders and/or President-elect Donald Trump plan to “massively cut” Social Security by raising the retirement age to 69 and taking other steps in order to save Social Security have gone viral. "," A GOP lawmaker has introduced a plan to save Social Security by cutting benefits — but resident-elect Donald Trump and other GOP leaders don’t appear poised to massively cut Social Security in the near future. In light of a Social Security Board of Trustees report that Social Security would become insolvent by 2034 , Republican Congressman Sam Johnson released a “plan to permanently save Social Security” on December 8th, the last day of the 114th Congress. Johnson said his plan to save Social Security was intended to start a “fact-based conversation” when Congress reconvenes next year. The plan includes seven proposals, several of which would increase the full retirement age to 69, reform how benefits are calculated, and slow benefit increases by linking them to rate of inflation: “For years I’ve talked about the need to fix Social Security so that our children and grandchildren can count on it to be there for them just like it’s there for today’s seniors and individuals with disabilities,” Sam Johnson said. “My commonsense plan is the start of a fact-based conversation about how we do just that. I urge my colleagues to also put pen to paper and offer their ideas about how they would save Social Security for generations to come. Americans want, need, and deserve for us to finally come up with a solution to saving this important program.” It wasn’t clear if Rep. Johnson intended for the plan to be voted on by Congress, or if it was meant to be a place to start a conversation about how to save Social Security. The plan did, however, stir panic that the GOP was going to save Social Security by imposing massive cuts. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan released “A Better Way,” a GOP policy blueprint earlier this year. Among other policy proposals, A Better Way lays the groundwork for privatizing Medicare by turning it into a voucher program. However, A Better Way does not outline a GOP plan to save Social Security — which could signal that Ryan did not intend on doing so in 2017. As for Donald Trump, he’s been fairly consistent about the need to save Social Security. Throughout the campaign, Trump said he would be unwilling to cut or gut Social Security and was instead focused on maintaining it through economic growth. In July, Trump told AARP he’d save Social Security by growing gross domestic product (GDP): “If we are able to sustain growth rates in GDP that we had as a result of the Kennedy and Reagan tax reforms, we will be able to secure Social Security for the future. As our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations. Our goal is to keep the promises made to Americans through our Social Security program.” During a Republican primary debate in South Carolina in February 2016, Trump indicated that his plan to save Social Security would also center on eliminating waste and fraud: I’m going to save Social Security. You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. We have in Social Security thousands of people over 106 years old. You know they don’t exist. There’s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we’re going to get it. But we’re not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they’re supposed to get less. We’re bringing jobs back. During another debate with Hillary Clinton in September, Trump said he would be ok with limiting Social Security for the country’s richest people to help save Social Security. And in 2013, Trump said the GOP could not change Medicare and Social Security and still win elections. Finally, in his 2011 book “Time to Get Tough,” Trump wrote that Social Security isn’t an “entitlement,” it’s honoring a deal: Social Security faces a problem: 77 million baby boomers set to retire. Now I know there are some Republicans who would be just fine with allowing these programs to wither and die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and Medicare are wasteful “entitlement programs.” But people who think this way need to rethink their position. It’s not unreasonable for people who paid into a system for decades to expect to get their money’s worth — that’s not an “entitlement,” that’s honoring a deal. We as a society must also make an ironclad commitment to providing a safety net for those who can’t make one for themselves. Social Security is here to stay. To be sure, we must reform it, root out the fraud, make it more efficient, and ensure that the program is solvent. Same goes for Medicare. Again, people have lived up to their end of the bargain and paid into the program in good faith. Of course they believe they’re “entitled” to receive the benefits they paid for — they are! So, GOP leaders haven’t indicated that they have plans to save Social Security by cutting benefits in the near future, and President-elect Trump has fairly consistently defended Social Security and spoken against cuts. For now, we’re reporting claims that the GOP plans to massively cut Social Security as fiction. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"“Dumped on Prom Night” Hillary Clinton on Election Night-Fiction!","2016-12-02 13:32:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dumped-prom-night-hillary-clinton-election-night/"," A “Dumped on Prom Night” story about Hillary Clinton’s election night letdown claims that Clinton went on a rampage, destroying everything in sight. "," A fake news website is behind “Dumped on Prom Night” reports about Hillary Clinton on election night. The story first appeared at The People’s Cube, described as a “political humor and satire collective” with a socialist bent, on November 12th. The story, published under the headline “Dumped on Prom Night,” starts out by describing the extravagant celebration Clinton had planned: Hillary Clinton’s night on the 9th of November went from a celebration to an absolute meltdown once the election unexpectedly turned on her leaving Trump as the victor. Some of the remnants of Hillary Clinton’s rampage in her private quarters was discovered by the custodial staff the day after the election. Hillary Clinton’s post election celebration included hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of fireworks, live performances by various celebrities such as Cher, who came believing that Hillary was going to win, a five hundred thousand dollar special effect glass ceiling that she would break through in a dramatic display once she won the election, among millions of dollars worth of celebratory preparations all paid for by the Clinton Foundation. The story then goes on to report on “notable damage” in a VIP room that Clinton had been using. The idea of Clinton breaking down in a fit of uncontrollable and destructive rage isn’t a new one. We even investigated a social media rumor that Clinton had a drunken meltdown on election night ( it was unproven ) and another rumor that she melted down after her Presidential Town Hall appearance with Matt Lauer ( also unproven ). Given that the latest version came from a notable fake news website, we’re calling it fiction. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"President Trump Can Send Unblockable Texts-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-12-01 15:22:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-unblockable-texts/"," President-elect Donald Trump will be able to use the FCC’s Emergency Alert System to send unblockable text messages to all Americans whenever he pleases. "," Claims that Donald Trump will be able to text all Americans whenever he wants to, whether they like it or not, are a combination of truth and fiction. First, it should be noted that Trump has made to mention of abusing the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) to send unblockable text messages to all Americans whenever he wants. At this point the rumor is purely speculation, and it appears to be based on a New York magazine story that appeared under the headline, “Starting January 20, Donald Trump Can Send Unblockable Mass Text Messages to the Entire Nation,” which picked up the story from Twitter user Chris Lawrence: You think Trump's tweets are bad? Wait until he has control over the completely unblockable presidential alerts on your cell phone. — Chris Lawrence (@lordsutch) November 29, 2016 First, let’s take a step back and look at how the WEA system was made possible. It was authorized under the Warning Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act of 2006. An FAQ posted at the FCC’s website explains: WEA is a public safety system that allows customers who own certain wireless phones and other enabled mobile devices to receive geographically-targeted, text-like messages alerting them of imminent threats to safety in their area. The technology ensures that emergency alerts will not get stuck in highly congested areas, which can happen with standard mobile voice and texting services. WEA (formerly known as the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) or Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN)) was established pursuant to the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act. The FCC goes on to explain that WEA alerts cover only “critical emergency situations” and can include alerts from the president, Amber Alerts for missing children, and alerts involving imminent threats to safety or life. The WEA system, by design, allows wireless customers to block some alerts — but not those issued by the president: Can I block WEA alerts? Partially. Participating wireless carriers may offer subscribers with WEA-capable handsets the ability to block alerts involving imminent threats to safety of life and/or AMBER Alerts; however, consumers cannot block emergency alerts issued by the President. Why can’t consumers block WEAs issued by the President? In passing the WARN Act, Congress allowed participating carriers to offer subscribers the capability to block all WEAs except those issued by the President. So, the FCC states that the alerts can be used only in “critical emergency situations,” but it does not go any further in describing what situations would qualify. The original WARN Act doesn’t provide any clarity either. Rather, it called for an advisory committee to come up with standards for the WEA system within 180 days of passage. And, according to an FCC notice of rule making , regulations were drafted to ensure that WEA was used only as an “emergency” alerting system “because if the public were to receive alerts that did not relate to bona fide emergencies, it would risk increasing consumer opt out.” A FEMA FAQ goes further by stating that presidential alerts can only be used “during a national emergency,” and reports from 2011 narrow the definition of allowable presidential alerts even further as “alerts involving imminent threats to safety or life as in the case of some sort of attack or natural disaster.” So, it’s true that Donald Trump could send mass text messages to Americans in limited circumstances like a national emergency, natural disaster or situations involving imminent threats — but not whenever he wants to.

"Mattel Releasing Public Assistance Barbie-Fiction!","2016-11-28 12:06:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mattel-releasing-public-assistance-barbie/"," Mattel is releasing “Public Assistance Barbie” for the holidays. "," An old fake news report from 2014 that a Public Assistance Barbie would be released in time for Christmas began circulating again in 2016.

"President Obama’s Uniparty Slush Fund-Fiction!","2016-11-21 09:39:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obamas-uniparty-slush-fund/"," Most Americans don’t know that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, aka the Stimulus Package, has renewed $1 trillion in federal spending in each of the last eight years, creating a “Uniparty Slush Fund” for President Obama. "," Claims that the Stimulus Package has quietly authored $1 trillion in federal spending in each of President Obama’s eight years in office, creating a Uniparty Slush Fund, are false. The rumor appears to have started with an article appearing at the Conservative Treehouse blog site under the headline, “Most Americans Don’t Know About President Obama’s UniParty Slush Fund.” The article first details how President-elect Donald Trump will be able to reverse Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), DREAM Act and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) executive actions without the help of Congress. Then, it makes a series of false claims about the Stimulus Package to support the idea that Obama has had access to a little-known Uniparty Slush Fund for the last eight years: In February 2009 congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA, commonly referred to as Obama’s stimulus plan.  The stimulus was just shy of one trillion ($986 billion +/-). At the time of passage this single stimulus expenditure reflected a growth of approximately 20% in total federal spending.  The spending went directly into the deficit. Approximately 30% of that “one time” trillion dollar stimulus was spent in 2009, the remaining 70% was spent in 2010.  (*note fiscal years run from October 1st to September 3oth annually). However, absent a federal budget -and because of baseline budgeting- it became a repeated expenditure in each of the following fiscal years. The $1 Trillion Stimulus was spent eight more times. The idea that $1 trillion in stimulus spending became “a repeated expenditure in each of the following eight years” because of the absence of a new federal budget and baseline budgeting practices is completely false. The measure gave the federal government “ budget authority ” to spend a given amount of money for certain purposes, according to laws passed by Congress. The measure was not passed as part of the federal budget, and it does not “renew” with continuing resolutions passed by Congress. The ARRA legislative package outlined nearly $1 trillion in direct spending in infrastructure, education, healthcare, energy, tax incentives and social welfare programs as part of that budget authority. The stimulus package included a detailed accounting of one-time investments to be made in those specific areas, and various online databases feature dime-for-dime accountings of where stimulus spending went. Besides that, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is required to report on the impact of Stimulus Package spending each year, and part of that accounting is a review of the total cost of the measure. In its most recent report, the CBO found that the Stimulus Package would increase budget deficits a total of $840 billion between fiscal years 2009 and 2019: When ARRA was being considered, the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would increase budget deficits by $787 billion between fiscal years 2009 and 2019. CBO now estimates that the total impact over the 2009– 2019 period will amount to nearly $840 billion. By CBO’s estimate, close to half of that impact occurred in fiscal year 2010, and more than 95 percent of ARRA’s budgetary impact was realized by the end of December 2014. If, as the UniParty Slush Fund claim suggests, the Stimulus Package renewed $1 trillion in federal investments every single year, the economic impact of the bill would be far greater than $840 billion over a 10-year period. So, claims that President Obama has a UniParty Slush Fund, and that the Stimulus Package renews each year, are false. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Donald Trump Wins Popular Vote in 2016 Election-Reported as Fiction!","2016-11-14 07:56:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-wins-popular-vote-in-2016-election/"," President-elect Donald Trump won the Electoral College and the popular vote despite claims that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and still lost the election. "," Hillary Clinton was leading in the popular vote by 630,877 votes as of November 13, but there were still millions of uncounted ballots that hadn’t been counted. At last count there were about 7 million uncounted ballots, mostly in states that Clinton carried by wide margins, so it seems unlikely that Donald Trump would close on Clinton’s popular vote margin of victory. Even so, Donald Trump gained 290 electoral votes (270 are needed) by winning key swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Clinton, meanwhile, won 228 electoral votes but opened up a popular vote lead with overwhelming support in non-swing states like California, where she held a 28-point lead over Trump As of November 14th, Clinton led Trump in the popular vote by 60,350,241 to 60,981,118, a margin of about 630,877 votes, the Associated Press reports . However, millions of votes across the country hadn’t yet been added to the final tally. The Los Angeles Times reported on November 10th that there were more than 4 million ballots in California, which would likely add to Clinton’s popular vote lead: The official total — 4,362,087 ballots — will undoubtedly change and possibly even grow over the next few days. Three counties, including vote-rich San Diego County, did not submit an estimate of unprocessed ballots for Thursday night’s statewide report. In addition, California law says that any ballot postmarked by election day can still be counted if it arrives as many as three business days late. State officials have extended this year’s deadline to Monday, because that third day, Nov. 11, is a federal holiday. More than 1 million of the pending ballots — almost one of every four — remain to be sorted and counted in Los Angeles County. Three-fourths of the ballots statewide were cast absentee, with the rest being provisional ballots cast on election day by voters whose registration information could not be quickly verified. The Atlantic reported on November 13th that there were about 7 million uncounted provisional and absentee ballots, mostly in California, Washington and New York: State officials are still counting millions of provisional and absentee ballots, and within two weeks, Clinton will likely have another few million votes in the bank. Most were cast in the Clinton-leaning states of California, Washington, and New York—not swing states—so they won’t change the Electoral College. But there’s a sufficient amount to put her within striking distance of Obama’s 2012 turnout, and help put an end to the argument that she simply didn’t work hard enough. “We probably have about 7 million votes left to count,” said David Wasserman, an editor at Cook Political Report who is tracking turnout. “A majority of them are on the coasts, in New York, California, and Washington. She should be able to win those votes, probably 2-1.” By mid-December, when the Electoral College officially casts its ballots, Wasserman estimates that Clinton could be ahead by 2 percentage points in the popular vote. Clinton’s likely popular vote victory led to a Change.org petition for the Electoral College to cast electoral ballots for Clinton on December 19th. The petition, which had about 4.3 million signatures, states: On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why? Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President. Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump “won” is because of the Electoral College. But the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result? In the wake of the petition, rumors began circulating that the Trump had actually wont the popular vote but mainstream media withheld final tallies to make it appear Trump lost the popular vote to stir controversy. We didn’t find any evidence to support that claim. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," President Obama hasn’t contested the results of the 2016 presidential election, and there’s no “revote” scheduled for December 19th. Those rumors strem from an article that appears at a fake news website that uses the likeness of ABC News to trick readers into believing its articles are factual. The site published the report on November 10th under the headline, “Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation into Election Results; Revote Planned for Dec. 19th.” It begins: WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. “People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.” Under the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. In reality, Obama signed no such executive order. A complete list of executive orders can be found on the White House’s official website, and nothing about a review of election results or a revote on December 19th appears there. Beside that, Obama has publicly embraced the election results and said he and an “excellent meeting” with Trump in the Oval Office a few days after the election. ","9-11 Attack on America"

The story first appeared at GotNews under the headline, “Breaking: Ex-Apprentice #SummerZervos Paid $500,000 by @GloriaAllred to Accuse Trump, Deal Went to Others Too,” accused Zervos of being a “fake rape.” The story beings: The Apprentice loser and Trump “fake rape” accuser Summer Zervos was bribed $500,000 by Democrat fundraiser and lawyer Gloria Allred to make her accusations against Donald Trump, a deal that was shopped around to other ex-Apprentice contestants too, according to anonymous sources familiar with the matter. GotNews’ source tells us that Zervos’ sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a “completely fabricated hoax.” Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out “slowly over time” according to our source. The story was quickly picked up and circulated on right-wing websites. Later, the original was updated with a comment from Gloria Allred, an attorney and Democratic booster, who denied the allegations: Your “tip” is completely false. I have never paid anyone to come forward. Feel free to tell your tipster, who is probably a Trump supporter that I said so. Zervos came forward in October with allegations that she was sexually assaulted by Trump. Zervos, who was represented by Allred, said Trump groped and kissed her in 2007 when she approached him about a job opportunity, ABC News reports : “When I arrived, he kissed me on the lips. I was surprised, but felt that perhaps that was just his form of greeting,” Zervos said in a statement that she read, sometimes haltingly and and often with tears. Trump praised her intelligence and attractiveness and said “that he would love to have me work for him,” according to Zervos. He promised to contact her a few days later, when he was in Los Angeles, then sent her off with another kiss on the lips. “This made me feel very nervous and embarrassed,” Zervos said. “When I arrived, he kissed me on the lips.

Trump “thrusted his genitals” against her. He eventually stopped and their conversation turned to finances, she said. Their evening ended abruptly when he said he was tired, but he then asked her to meet him at his Palos Verdes golf course, Zervos said, and she wondered whether his advances had been “some kind of test,” since it seemed he was still considering her for a job.

"NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Clinton Emails-Unproven!","2016-11-04 09:49:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nypd-blows-whistle-new-hillary-clinton-emails/"," NYPD sources have signaled that new evidence uncovered on another computer owned by Anthony Weiner will lead to charges against Hillary Clinton and her allies, including money laundering, child sex crimes, child exploitation, pay to play and perjury. "," Claims about an “NYPD bombshell” in the Hillary Clinton email case are based on unidentified rumors and are unfounded. About a week after FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI would re-open its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server after additional emails were found on a computer used by Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, fringe websites began reporting that a new “NYPD bombshell” would blow the case wide open. Rumors about the NYPD bombshell appear to have started with a story at fringe right wing website True Pundit on November 2nd that begins: New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,” NYPD sources told True Pundit. NYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. The story was quickly picked up by other fringe websites, and a full-blown conspiracy theory was born. There’s no way for us (or anyone else) to fact-check the story, however, because it cites anonymous sources. True Pundit was been behind numerous conspiracy theories about the Clintons. Earlier in the campaign, True Pundit was behind unfounded rumors that Hillary Clinton used a secret earpiece during a debate with Donald Trump. Again, the story relied on unnamed sources and “buzz” in the New York law enforcement community. And again, there’s no way to definitively prove whether this story is true or false.

"NYPD Investigates Bill Clinton in Underage Sex Ring-Fiction!","2016-11-03 09:36:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-took-jeffrey-epsteins-lolita-express/"," The NYPD is investigating Bill Clinton for his role in a sex ring after new documents were discovered on Anthony Weiner’s computer. "," Bill Clinton isn’t being investigated by the NYPD for his role in an underaged sex ring. That false rumor is a mashup of truthful reports that FBI Director James Comey had re-opened investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and that Bill Clinton traveled on Jeffery Epstein’s personal jet, the “Lolita Express,” in the early 2000s. Accusations about Clinton’s ties to Epstein, an eccentric billionaire who pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor in 2008 , came to light in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election. The Christian Times Newspaper — a fake news website commonly confused with the reputable Christian Times —  invited controversy with a story appearing under the headline, “ SOURCES: NYPD Looking to Press Charges Against Bill Clinton for Underage Sex Ring,” that begins: Sources within the New York Police Department are confirming that the NYPD is currently investigating allegations that Bill Clinton performed sexual acts on underage girls ranging from 5 to 14 years old in recent years.  These reports have been confirmed my multiple others, and it appears that the NYPD is closing in on the former President. According to senior sources within the department, investigators are making plans to bring charges against Clinton and his accomplices after finding new information in Anthony Wiener’s emails this weekend. News broke in May that Clinton’s relationship with known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein extended much further than previously reported. There’s no such NYPD investigation. Clinton’s ties to Epstein resurfaced in January 2015 after Gawker secured Epstein’s flightlogs dating back to the early 2000s . The news site reported that Clinton took “more than a dozen trips” on Epstein’s “Lolita Express” with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and former Epstein assistant Sarah Kellen, who were later accused of recruiting underage girls: Clinton shared Epstein’s plane with Kellen and Maxwell on at least 11 flights in 2002 and 2003—before any of the allegations against them became public—according to the pilots’ logbooks, which have surfaced in civil litigation surrounding Epstein’s crimes. In January 2002, for instance, Clinton, his aide Doug Band, and Clinton’s Secret Service detail are listed on a flight from Japan to Hong Kong with Epstein, Maxwell, Kellen, and two women described only as “Janice” and “Jessica.” One month later, records show, Clinton hopped a ride from Miami to Westchester on a flight that also included Epstein, Maxwell, Kellen, and a woman described only as “one female.” However, it’s important to note that Epstein was a well-respected financier and philanthropist in the early 2000s. Simply flying on his plane doesn’t mean that Clinton played a role in a sex ring. Later accusations took many of Epstein’s high-powered friends by surprise — including, apparently, Donald Trump and the Clintons. Both parties were friends of Epstein, and they spoke glowingly about Epstein in an old New York magazine profile : Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science,” Clinton says through a spokesman. “I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.” The “recent trip to Africa” cited Clinton aide one of Bill Clinton’s trips aboard the Lolita Express. As it turns out, Clinton convinced Epstein to make his plane available for a weeklong anti-poverty and AIDS tour in Africa that included A-list stars like actor Kevin Spacey. However, the appearance of woman named Chauntae Davies in the flightlog released by Gawker sparked even more speculation about a sex ring. Davies, who was a 22-year-old struggling actress at the time of the flight, told “Inside Edition” in 2015 that Epstein paid her to be an “in-air hostess” to his high-power friends. She regularly gave massages and yoga instruction to passengers. Davies even recalled the Africa trip with Clinton during the interview: On one memorable flight, she says she made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for passengers including Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey, actor Chris Tucker and, even Bill Clinton. They were all flying to Africa on a humanitarian mission and Jeffrey Epstein had given them the use of his jet. Moret asked, “So, you never gave President Clinton a massage?” She laughed and said, “No, I didn’t.” Davies said when the plane landed in Africa, Clinton took her shopping she says nothing improper occurred. “They had shut down a jewelry store for us and I helped him pick out a bracelet for Chelsea,” she said. But Davies indicated that young women were always around on Epstein flights, and that she later became uncomfortable with being part of his “collection.” In the end, claims that the NYPD is investigating Clinton’s role in a sex ring is false. But Clinton was tied to Epstein and his notorious plane in the early 2000s. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Soldiers Forced to Repay Enlistment Bonus Years After Going to War-Truth!","2016-10-24 12:22:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/soldiers-forced-repay-enlistment-bonus-years-going-war/"," California National Guard soldiers have been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses a decade after deploying to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. "," About 10,000 California National Guard soldiers have been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses of $15,000 or more after audits revealed widespread overpayments. The Los Angeles Times broke the news on October 22nd in a story appearing under the headline, “Thousands of California Soldiers Forced to Repay Enlistment Bonuses a Decade after Going to War,” that reports: Nearly 10,000 soldiers, many of whom served multiple combat tours, have been ordered to repay large enlistment bonuses — and slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens if they refuse — after audits revealed widespread overpayments by the California Guard at the height of the wars last decade. Investigations have determined that lack of oversight allowed for widespread fraud and mismanagement by California Guard officials under pressure to meet enlistment targets. But soldiers say the military is reneging on 10-year-old agreements and imposing severe financial hardship on veterans whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the Pentagon needed to fill the ranks. The Pentagon began offering enlistment and reenlistment bonuses as soldier levels dropped as wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wore on with no end in sight. The bonuses were paid up-front, and the National Guard Bureau has found that overpayments occurred in every state at the peak of the two wars, according to the report: Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, the California Guard’s incentive manager, pleaded guilty in 2011 to filing false claims of $15.2 million and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison. Three officers also pleaded guilty to fraud and were put on probation after paying restitution. Instead of forgiving the improper bonuses, the California Guard assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14,000 soldiers, a process that was finally completed last month. Roughly 9,700 current and retired soldiers have been told by the California Guard to repay some or all of their bonuses and the recoupment effort has recovered more than $22 million so far. Because of protests, appeals and refusal by some to comply, the recovery effort is likely to continue for years. It’s not clear whether or not the Department of Defense will follow through on forcing the soldiers to repay their bonuses. U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) called on Defense Secretary Ash Carter to outline steps to correct the mistakes without penalizing veterans, and he also called on legislators negotiating the National Defense Authorization Act to insert language that specifically prohibits forcing soldiers to repay enlistment bonuses.

The Boston Tribune started the rumor with a story that appeared under the headline, “First Grandma Marian Robinson to Receive Lifetime $160,000 Government Pension” on October 17h. The story begins: Washington D.C. – First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will receive a lifetime 160K government pension when she leaves the White House next year, according to congressional budget statements. According to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson earned the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s two terms in office. In January of 2009, it was reported that Mrs. Robinson was living in the White House full-time to tend to her granddaughters. She was the first live-in grandmother at the White House since Elivera M. Doud, the mother of Mamie Eisenhower, during the Eisenhower Administration. In reality, Marian Robinson is not, as the article claims, listed as child caregiver on the White House’s official staff registry . She hasn’t collected a salary during the President Obama’s time in office — and she won’t collect a lifetime pension after he leaves office. Within days, however, the false report had been viewed 200,000 times. Angry readers commented about government waste and cronyism related to the so-called first grandma pension.

"Ben & Jerry’s Founders ‘We Hate Cops’ Sign and Boycott-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-10-14 07:55:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ben-jerrys-founders-hate-cops-sign-boycott/"," Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the founders of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, can be seen in a photo holding a sign that says “we hate cops” and have taken up anti-cop positions. "," The founders of Ben & Jerry didn’t hold up a sign that says, “we hate cops” — but they have been active in protesting racial injustice and voiced support for Black Lives Matter. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were among a group of 300 people who were arrested for protesting around the U.S. Capitol in April 2016. They were protesting with the group “Democracy Awakening,” which was advocating for, among other things, racial injustice, voting rights, action on climate change, workers rights and fair pay. Ben & Jerry’s followed that up by publishing a post on the “What’s New” section of its website under the headline “7 Ways We Know Systemic Racism is Real” that cites statistics about wealth, employment, education, criminal justice, housing, surveillance and healthcare to argue that racism is prevalent at “every level of society.” Another post appearing in the “What’s New” section of Benny & Jerry’s website under the headline “Why Black Lives Matter” that voice support for the movement but continues: We want to be clear: we believe that saying Black lives matter is not to say that the lives of those who serve in the law enforcement community don’t. We respect and value the commitment to our communities that those in law enforcement make, and we respect the value of every one of their lives. But we do believe that — whether Black, brown, white, or blue — our nation and our very way of life is dependent on the principle of all people being served equal justice under the law. And it’s clear, the effects of the criminal justice system are not color blind. That led the pro-police group Blue Lives Matter to i ssue a nationwide boycott of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream on October 10th for announcing “their support for Black Lives Matter along with a misinformation campaign accusing law enforcement of widespread systemic and institutionalized racism”: Ben & Jerry’s went beyond making a statement in support of civil rights when they actively accused law enforcement of widespread racism. By spreading these false and misleading statements, Ben & Jerry’s lends an appearance of legitimacy to the baseless claims that police officers are killing men based on the color of their skin. This message has inspired the assassination and attempted assassination of police officers, and it costs officers their lives. In the fallout of Blue Lives Matter’s call for a national boycott, a photo appearing to show the Ben & Jerry’s founders holding a sign that states “we hate cops” went viral. This photo isn’t real. It was actually taken at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire on February 5, 2016, and they were holding a “Bernie Sanders 2016” sign: Someone used photo editing software to replace “Bernie 2016” with “we hate cops” in the photo. So, rumors about Ben & Jerry’s, Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter are a combination of truth and fiction. The ice cream maker has supported Black Lives Matter, but it also voiced support for police officers in the same statement. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Jill Stein was critical of Hillary Clinton in an interview on C-SPAN, and she said Donald Trump’s plan for dealing with Russia would be better — but Stein did not endorse Trump. The rumor that Stein has endorsed Trump started with a report that appeared at the fringe website USA Politics Today on October 13th under the headline, “BREAKING: Jill Stein Just ENDORSED Donald Trump! Watch Her Obliterate Hillary!” The story begins: It’s nice to see people coming out and supporting Trump instead of condemning him. If Hillary Clinton wanted to recruit some of the independent voters, she just lost that chance. Jill Stein just came out and destroyed Hillary Clinton and everything she stands for. In the video, she says that “Donald Trump is better” and that “Hillary Clinton more likely is start nuclear war. While Stein was definitely critical of Clinton, the USA Politics Today article took some of her statements out of context to advance the idea that Stein had actually endorsed Trump. In reality, Stein is a presidential candidate herself who has endorsed nobody. However, during the C-SPAN interview on October 12th , Stein said, “Hillary Clinton is more likely to start nuclear war” than Trump, as the story reported. Here’s Stein’s full quote: …It’s Clinton who wants to start an air war with Russia over Syria by calling for a no fly zone. We have 2,000 nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert, and Michael Gorbatjov, the former premier of the Soviet Union, is saying we are closer to nuclear war than we have ever been. Under Hillary Clinton, we could slide into nuclear war very quickly from her declared policy in Syria. I sure won’t sleep well at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. And the idea that Stein said “Trump is better” than Clinton came from Stein’s quote that Trump’s idea for dealing with Russia were better than Clinton’s: We have another choice other than these two candidates who are both promoting illegal policies. On the issue war and weasel weapons, it is actually Hillary’s policies, which are much scarier than Donald Trump who does not want to go to war with Russia. He wants to seek modes of working together, which is the root that we need to follow, not to go into confrontation and nuclear war with Russia. Further disproving the idea that Stein endorsed Clinton was Stein’s argument that Clinton was ill equipped to deal with so-called problems brought on by Trump and right-wing extremism that arose in response to Clinton polcies: Even Donald Trump and the right-wing extremism grows out of the policies of the Clintons. In particular, NAFT, which sent our jobs overseas, and Wall Street deregulation, which blew 9 million jobs up into smoke. A vote for Hillary Clinton isn’t going to fix it. So, Stein has been critical of both Trump and Clinton. But since she’s vying to win the presidential election herself, don’t expect Stein to endorse either of the major party candidates in the general election. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"FBI Director James Comey Received Millions from Clinton Foundation-Unproven!","2016-10-05 13:39:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fbi-director-james-comey-received-millions-from-clinton-foundation/"," FBI Director James Comey chose not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server because he received millions from the Clinton Foundation. "," It’s true that James Comey received millions from Lockheed Martin, but there’s no proof that Comey’s position or salary at Lockheed Martin were related to the Clinton Foundation. The rumor started in September 2016 with a story published by Breitbart under the headline, “Exposed: FBI Director James Comey’s Clinton Foundation Connection.” The story reported that Comey was “deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C.” and continued: Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel. How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation. Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010. According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010. In 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department. It’s true that Comey accepted a position at Lockheed Martin that paid him millions, but it’s not clear that the position had anything to do with the Clinton Foundation. The idea that the State Department granted Lockheed Martin 17 private contracts under Hillary Clinton doesn’t necessarily mean much, either, since Lockheed is the biggest federal contractor and rakes in hundreds of billions each year in federal contracts regardless of who’s serving as secretary of state. And, prior to joining Lockheed Martin, Comey worked (as Breitbart reported) in President George W. Bush’s administration as a deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft. That means Comey wasn’t linked to Democrats or the Clintons at the time. In a USA Today Network report from 2011, Comey explained his decision to leave the Bush administration to join Lockheed Martin. He said it was made out of financial necessity because he had five children who would be attending college, but it’s not an unusual transition for a high-level cabinet member to make: In October 2005, Comey accepted a position as senior vice president and general counsel for Lockheed Martin Corp., the Pentagon’s leading defense contractor. His decision to trade his high-profile career in government service for the private sector had the simplest of motives. “I have five children between the ages of 5 and 17 and will be paying college tuitions for the next 15 years,” Comey said. “I want them to be able to attend the colleges of their choice.” Comey, who was in charge of more than 140 lawyers at Lockheed, continued, “I dreaded leaving public service. I loved getting paid for doing something good for the country. Even so, I am excited about my opportunity at Lockheed Martin.” Comey weighed his options carefully. Unlike some of his counterparts, who entered the private sector after years in public service, Comey couldn’t take too much time off to ponder the possibilities. “I needed to make mortgage payments and support my family,” he chuckled. “But, the decision was an easy one because I respect and admire the corporate values of Lockheed Martin. They are a successful company with a strong reputation. I’m not here to clean up compliance issues. I’m here to build for the future.” To satisfy any concerns about conflict of interest, Comey publicly stated that, during his tenure as deputy attorney general and his time as U.S. attorney, he never had any dealings with Lockheed Martin. Breitbart also noted that Comey had been granted a position on the board of London bank HSBC Holdings — another organization that has a relationship with the Clinton Foundation. And again, it’s true that Comey was appointed to the board of HSBC Holdings in 2013 — but gain, there’s no proof that the appointment was in any way related to the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation. An HSBC press release explained that Comey had received the appointment because of “experience and expertise (he) gained from public and private sector roles at the highest level.” So, while it’s true that Comey has had business relationships with two entities that have worked with the Clinton Foundation — there’s no indication that Comey received any money from the Clinton Foundation, or that he was awarded those positions because of his relationship with the Clintons. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Thousands of Fraudulent Clinton Votes Found in Ohio Warehouse-Fiction!","2016-10-03 09:32:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/thousands-of-fraudulent-clinton-votes-found-in-ohio-warehouse/"," Tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton votes were found in a warehouse in Ohio. "," Reports tens of thousands fraudulent Hillary Clinton were found in an Ohio warehouse appear to be false — but authorities in Ohio have launched an official investigation into the rumor. The rumor started with a story that appeared at Christian Times Newspaper (not to be confused with the reputable Christian Times publication), under the headline, “BREAKING: ‘Tens of Thousands’ of Fraudulent Clinton Votes Found in Ohio Warehouse,” that reports : Election officials in Franklin County, Ohio are reportedly stumped over what one maintenance worker found in a dilapidated downtown Columbus warehouse earlier this week. According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates. “No one really goes in this building. It’s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,” Prince said. So when Prince, who is a Trump supporter, saw several black boxes in an otherwise empty room, he went to investigate. What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state. Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October 12, so no votes have officially been cast in the Buckeye state.  However, inside these boxes were, what one source described as, “potentially tens of thousands of votes” for Hillary Clinton. A photo accompanying the story shows Prince posing behind a stack of the black cartons marked “ballot box” that he supposedly found in the Ohio warehouse. However, those black boxes can easily be identified as the ballot boxes used in England, not in the U.S. And the photo of the man posing behind the ballot boxes was taken from a stock photo website called Alamy. The site has additional photos of the ballot boxes and the man with the caption , “Ballot Boxes being delivered to Sheldon Heath community centre ready for voting in General Election.” So, clearly the photo used in the Christian Times Newspaper story does not show ballot boxes found in an Ohio warehouse. Christian Times Newspaper has a knack for publishing fake news stories that appear to be real. Its name is so similar to the reputable Christian Times site , which often creates confusion among readers. We previously investigated previous false reports from the site that all 4th of July fireworks displays had been canceled due to terrorism fears , that Donald Trump had been removed from primary ballots in five states , and that Russian hacker “Guccifer” was found dead in his jail cell after hacking Clinton’s email sever . When it comes to the Clinton election fraud story, the Christian Times Newspaper story was so believable that it sparked an investigation among elections officials in Franklin County, Ohio, an NBC affiliate reports : The Franklin County Board of Elections says that a preliminary investigation shows that the article is fake, and the photo portrayed as the worker standing with the ballot boxes was lifted from a2015 article in the Birmingham Post, an English newspaper, and altered slightly, with some of the ballot boxes repositioned and resized, and some of the labels blurred out. Elections officials would like to remind everyone that absentee voting in the state does not start until Oct. 12. The Board of Elections says that no ballots have been printed or mailed, except for those that were requested by members of the military and US citizens who live abroad. The Board of Elections also has several security measures in place to help uphold the integrity of the electoral process: -The computer system used to create the ballot and tabulate results is not connected to an outside network and thus is not vulnerable to outside intrusion. -Each ballot storage vault is maintained under a double lock requiring a Democrat and Republican to simultaneously unlock -A double lock system is used to secure the Vote Center and must be unlocked by a Democrat and Republican simultaneously. -Both parties are required to sign a chain of custody for all mailed ballots delivered to or picked up from the USPS. -Access to sensitive ballot storage areas are secured by keys that are maintained in storage containers requiring palm scan access. -Votes are recorded in three ways (1) in a hard drive within the voting machine, (2) on the removable voting machine data card, and (3) on a paper tape inside the voting machine. -When the vote is counted, it’s done in a public setting which can be observed by parties, any campaign, the media, and the public. Given that Christian Times Newspaper is known for publishing false reports, that a photo used in the story actually shows an elections worker delivering ballots in England, and that Franklin County, Ohio, elections workers looked into the report, we’re calling reports that tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton ballots were found “fiction.” ","9-11 Attack on America"

The rumor started with an article published by Associated Media Coverage under the headline, “New Federal Gun Law Prevents Open Carry in All 50 States,” that reports : According to Carl Peterson, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the regulation was implemented in effort to create uniformity among states and increase public safety. Previously, individual states were permitted to create and enforce laws pertaining to the practice of open carry ranging from No Permit Needed(meaning that no permits or licenses are required to open carry), Permit Required(meaning that the practice of open carry is permissible upon obtaining a permit/license), and No Open Carry Permitted (meaning that the practice of open carry is strictly prohibited). According to Peterson, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives worked closely with several organizations when drafting the regulation including local law enforcement agencies, the Brady Campaign, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, EveryTown for Gun Safety, and Moms Demand Action. Peterson told reporters that the ATF additionally had the support of President Obama and though he wasn’t directly involved in drafting the regulation, he did assist in expediting the implementation process. The story was widely circulated on social media and, taken out of context, many readers mistakenly believed that it was credible report. One reader commented: Here we go again: number one no one has the right to take your constitution right from you. In the constitution it says that you can not take a constitution right and turn it into a crime. To buy the way let’s take all the guns away so the only ones that have them is the cops and criminals and then they can take your knifes next!!!!! Associated Media Coverage doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake or satirical news site — but we’ve investigated plenty of false claims that have come from it. There have been (false) reports of a motorcycle curfew and two-pet maximum ordinance , just to name a few. Just like previous reports from Associated Media Coverage, there’s no truth to this one.

"Olympian Kim Rhode Shunned Because She Loves Guns, Trump-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-08-19 13:03:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/olympian-kim-rhode-shunned-loves-guns-trump/"," The media ignored Kim Rhode, a Team USA skeet shooter who has won a medal at a record-setting six Olympic games, because she loves guns and Donald Trump. "," Kim Rhode is a decorated Olympian and the first woman to medal at six straight Olympic games — but accusations that the media “shunned” Rhodes because of her personal beliefs are impossible to prove true or false. First, we’ll start with Rhodes’ Olympic accomplishments. She is a six-time Olympian (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016). Overall, she has won three gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze medals in skeet shooting. And her Team USA biography states that she is “an honorary lifetime member of the NRA.” In 2016, Rhode became the first female Olympian to medal in six different Olympic games by winning the bronze medal on August 12th at the Summer Games in Rio. An official Team USA release quotes Rhodes as saying that she would attempt to go for a seventh: Rhode became the first female Olympian to win a medal in six straight Olympic Games and is tied with Italian luger Armin Zoeggeler, who accomplished the same feat from 1994 to 2014. “I do love the pressure,” said Rhode. “I do love the competition, but at the same time, I think it’s just standing up there on that podium. It’s addicting. It has me coming back again and again.” Her bronze in women’s skeet at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games on Friday marked the fifth continent on which Rhode has won a medal. She defeated Meng Wei of China 7-6 in a shoot-off in the bronze-medal match after both hit 15 of 16 targets. “It’s amazing,” Rhode said. “I’m just blown away myself.” With International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach in the stands, both missed a shot – first Rhode, then Wei – which let Rhode back in the door. Wei missed, and Rhode pumped her fist quietly and then hugged her coaches. “I was actually kind of shocked,” Rhode said, “but I think it made for a great final. We’re all Olympians. At this level, we’re all good and she’s an incredible competitor. I knew she would be a tough competitor. I’m sure she’ll be back.” And so will Rhode. She isn’t finished. Six is not enough. “I’m going to go again,” Rhode said. “I’m going to try for a seventh. So this hopefully will not be my last. I said before (the competition) win, lose or draw, I’d be coming back again, so hopefully I’ll see everybody in Tokyo.” And if Los Angeles wins the right to host the 2024 Games, Rhode, who lives in California, said, “I probably have to stick around again. A hometown crowd, it would be amazing. This is my fifth continent, so it’d be great to go full circle back to LA and the United States.” However, media coverage of Rhode (or lack thereof) quickly sparked controversy. Social media was abuzz with people who claimed that Rhodes had been blacklisted from national coverage because of her support of guns and political beliefs. Those claims quickly made their way to conservative media outlets, with Allen B. West and Gateway Pundit both publishing reports that the media had silenced Rhode because of her personal beliefs. We did a quick check and found that Rhode’s historic feat was covered by national media outlets like USA Today , NBC , The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times , among others. We also found that NPR carried a lengthy piece on Rhode before the 2016 Olympic games began, which touched on her support of gun rights and criticism of media coverage of her sport: And as she’s grown older, becoming one of the most decorated sport shooters in the world, she’s become more vocal about the politics of guns. It wasn’t entirely by choice. Athletes in shooting sports have to be, she says. “At the London Games, the first question I got asked when I just won a gold medal in the Olympics wasn’t, ‘Tell us what it’s like to represent your country or what’s it like standing on the podium or what does this medal mean to you?'” she says. “It was: ‘Can you comment on Aurora?'” — a reference to the mass shooting in a movie theater that left 12 people dead. The same has happened in the lead-up to the Rio games. Rhode says she’s been asked to comment on recent mass shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino. “No other sport in the Olympics gets that,” she says. “They don’t ask the swimmers to comment after somebody drowns.” Rhode is sympathetic to the victims of gun violence. “It’s heartbreaking,” she says. But she feels like much of the legislation that comes out of mass shootings — especially in California — is ill-conceived. “We have a lot of bills and legislation that are making it very difficult for people to go out and enjoy that sport that I personally love,” she says. She points to a recently passed law that will require background checks for ammunition sales (“I go through a lot of ammunition,” she says) and another that will put stricter regulations on lending guns. “How is someone supposed to learn how to shoot if you can’t lend them a gun to try?” she says. More broadly, Rhode says, she’s frustrated by what she sees as a growing stigma against guns. “Everything we hear [about guns] on the media and news is nothing positive,” she says. “They don’t talk about the scholarships that kids are getting or the shooting teams around the country where kids are learning things like discipline, respect and teamwork — things they’ll use for the rest of their life.” Rhode wants more people to hear those positive stories about guns and sees the upcoming Olympics as an opportunity to do just that. By medaling in her sixth consecutive Olympics, Rhode could do something no other U.S. Olympian has accomplished. That would be a positive story. In the end, claims that the media shunned Rhode because of her support of second amendment rights or her political views can’t be proven true or false. National media outlets covered her historic win at the Rio Summer Games, but it’s easy for critics to argue that she would have or should have received more coverage if she hadn’t previously stumped for guns. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction.","9-11 Attack on America"
"Bernie Sanders Buys $600,000 Summer Home After Endorsing Clinton-Truth! & Unproven!","2016-08-12 14:40:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bernie-sanders-buys-600000-summer-home-after-endorsing-clinton-truth/"," Bernie Sanders bought a $600,000 summer home weeks after endorsing Clinton, leading to speculation that he was paid for his support. "," Reports that Bernie Sanders purchased a $600,000 summer home are true. But allegations that he was able to purchase the summer home after Hillary Clinton paid for his endorsement are unproven. Seven Days , an independent newspaper based in Vermont, confirmed that Sanders had purchased a $600,000 beachfront home on Lake Champlain on August 8th: The Burlington resident last week plopped down nearly $600,000 on a lakefront camp in North Hero. Sanders’ new crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of Lake Champlain beachfront on the east side of the island — facing Vermont, not New York. The Bern will keep his home in Burlington and use the new camp seasonally. Bernie’s new summer home has led to be criticism and speculation. Critics have pointed out that the summer home appears to fly in the face of the outspoken senator’s stance against income inequality and his socialist worldview. We’re not going to weigh in on that argument because it’s based solely on personal opinions. Others, however, have speculated that Sanders was able to purchase the $600,000 beachfront home because Hillary Clinton paid for his endorsement. ETF News , for example, implied as much with a story appearing under the headline, “Bernie Sanders Bought a $600,000 Summer Home 3 Weeks After Endorsing Hillary Clinton,” that reports : Hey, do you remember a few months back, when Bernie Sanders was regarded as the “honest” politician by both Democrats and Republicans, while we were telling everyone that he was an old socialist who wanted political power and cash, and no better than any other corrupt liar in office? Well, it seems like that everyone is overdue for a reality check, because just three weeks after Bernie Sanders officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for President, the aging democratic socialist and “man of the people” bought himself a lakefront summer home that cost more than half a million dollars. This will be Sanders’ third home. Gee, I wonder where all that money came from. Hmm. However, those accusations don’t hold up. Sanders’ wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders, told Seven Days that the couple was able to purchase the home because they’d sold a property in Maine that her family had held since the early 1900s: “My family had a lake home in Maine since 1900, but we hadn’t had the time to go there in recent years — especially since my parents passed away,” she said. “We finally let go of it and that enabled us to buy a place in the islands — something I’ve always hoped for. ” The Sanders also own a row house on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and a house in Burlington’s New North End. Sanders reported that he and his wife held between $194,026-$741,030 in assets, mostly a combination of investment funds, in a 2015 financial form, Politico reports . However, real estate holdings — like Jane O’Meara Sanders’ family property in Maine — are not included in financial disclosures, Bloomberg reports: Candidates report assets’ value in ranges so broad that they can be virtually meaningless. Their homes, cars and federal retirement plans are generally off limits from public view . Nor are presidential contenders subject to rules that make members of Congress disclose stock transactions within 45 days and reveal who holds their mortgages. The deadline is flexible, too. So, Jane O’Meara Sanders’ explanation that they purchased the beachfront home with money generated from the sale of the property in Maine don’t necessarily raise any red flags.

"," Ray Starmann’s open letter to Khizr Khan was published at Starman’s website , Defense Watch, on July 30th. Starmann’s open letter was in response to a speech that Khan delivered at the Democratic National Convention. Khan said that his family had demonstrated “undivided loyalty” to America while Donald Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” to the country. Starmann wrote, “Captain Khan is a hero. I am sure the soliders he served with regard him as one. I know you and your wife do. Rest assured that millions of veterans regard your son as a hero as well.” Starmann continued, the Khans arrived in America from Pakistan and assimilated into the country, but many Muslims other Muslims had no desire to assimilate: But, there are many Muslims in America who not only have no desire to assimilate, but wish to live under Sharia Law. That is unacceptable to Americans. There is only one law of the land. That is the USConstitution. As you well know, Mr. Khan, we live in violent times, dangerous times. Muslim madmen from ISIS and other radical Jihadi groups are on a murder and terror spree across the globe. Your religion of peace, Islam, is anything but that in 2016. That is a fact that is confirmed every time a Muslim shoots, bombs, beheads and tortures innocent men, women and children. This does not mean that every Muslim is a terrorist, but most terrorists, sir, are indeed Muslims. Despite the “feckless, naïve, leftist ideologue Barack Obama and his dimwitted colleagues John Kerry, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel state, the United States and the West are at war with Radical Islam,” Starmann continued: Groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda have one goal, the complete destruction of the Judeo-Christian culture, our religions and our way of life. Many Americans have families that have been here for decades, even centuries. Many families like mine have relatives who fought in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm. Some families have relatives who fought in the American Revolution. Starmann went on to defend Trump’s call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, questioning, “How in God’s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and thousands of other sundry Muslims who wish to arrive on our shores?” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Why Republicans Want Voter ID Laws-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-08-02 09:07:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/why-republicans-want-voter-id-laws/"," Republicans want voter ID laws because President Obama lost every state with voter ID laws in 2012, and there was widespread election fraud in states without voter ID laws that year. "," The idea that there was widespread voter fraud in 2012, and that President Obama lost every state with voter ID laws, are a combination of truth and fiction. We’ll start with the claim that Obama lost every state with voter ID laws in 2012. There were 11 states with voter ID laws in effect for the 2012 election, and Obama won four of them: Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire and Hawaii, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) reports . But it’s true that Mitt Romney carried states with “strict” voter ID laws that required a photo ID. Those states were Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Indiana. And it’s worth noting that Obama won Indiana in 2008 before a new voter ID law was implemented there for the 2012 election. Still, that doesn’t mean that photo voter ID laws were behind Obama losing those states. A Democrat hasn’t won Kansas in a presidential contest since 1964, for example , so it’s not exactly a surprise that Romney carried the state in 2012. Beside the claim that Obama lost states with voter ID laws in 2012, election data from specific districts around the country have been cited to argue that there was widespread voter fraud. We’ll take a look at each of those claims here: Obama Received 100% of Votes in 59 Districts in Philadelphia Region- Truth! Obama won 100 percent of votes in a number of districts in the Philadelphia region in both 2008 and 2012. In 2012, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Obama shut out Romney in 59 urban precincts there: Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia who has studied African American precincts, said he had occasionally seen 100 percent of the vote go for the Democratic candidate. Chicago and Atlanta each had precincts that registered no votes for Republican Sen. John McCain in 2008. “I’d be surprised if there weren’t a handful of precincts that didn’t cast a vote for Romney,” he said. But the number of zero precincts in Philadelphia deserves examination, Sabato added. “Not a single vote for Romney or even an error? That’s worth looking into,” he said. In a city with 1,687 of the ward subsets known as divisions, each with hundreds of voters, 59 is about 3.5 percent of the total. Overall, Obama won 85 percent of the vote in Philadelphia County. Mitt Romney captured more than 91,000 votes in the Philadelphia region, data shows . Obama Received 100% of Votes in Wood County, Ohio- Fiction! Poll results from Wood County, Ohio, show that Obama didn’t receive 100 percent of the votes in any district there. Overall, Obama won about 51 percent of the votes in Wood County. St. Lucie County Florida Had More Votes Cast than Registered Voters- Fiction! There weren’t more votes cast than there were registered voters in St. Lucie County, Florida, in 2012. Official election results show 123,301 votes were cast, and there were 175,554 registered voters. Romney earned 56,202 votes and Obama earned 65,869 in St. Lucie County. National SEAL Museum in St. Lucie County Had 158% Voter Turnout- Fiction! Election data shows that there were 2,756 registered voters in the district with the SEAL Museum polling location, and 2,243 votes were cast there. That amounts to an 81 percent voter turnout there — not 158 percent. Palm Beach County, Florida, Had 141% Voter Turnout- Fiction! Palm Beach County didn’t record a 141 percent voter turnout in 2012. The county’s supervisor of elections reported that about 70 percent of registered voters casted ballots. In the end, claims made in the “why Republicans want voter ID laws” commentary are a combination of truth and fiction. Still, the commentary fails to prove the larger point that there was widespread voter fraud in 2012. ","9-11 Attack on America"

In a post that was shared nearly 200,000 times within days of being on July 28th, Bonner explains that as a former military K9 handler, he had been assigned to details involving distinguished visitors. Hillary Clinton was one of those distinguished visitors, Bonner writes, and she wasn’t happy to see his service dog in her quarters: One of my Last details was for Hillary when she was Secretary of State. She was in Turkey for whatever reason. I helped with sweeps of her DV Quarters and staff vehicles. Her words to me? “Get that Fucking dog away from me.” Then she turns to her Security Detail and berates them up and down about why that animal was in her quarters. For the next 20 minutes while I sit there waiting to be released she lays into her detail, slamming the door in their faces when she’s done. The Detail lead walks over apologizes and releases me. I apologize to him for getting him in trouble. His words “Happens every day, Brother” Bonner also contrasts Clinton’s reaction to the dog with the reactions of George W. Bush (he made a joke and gave Bonner a high five) and Barack Obama (he asked what the hell kind of dog it was) to demonstrate how shrill Clinton’s response was. And, in the end, Bonner concluded he that he wouldn’t vote for Clinton because, “Hillary doesn’t’ care about anyone but Hillary.” In a follow-up post , Bonner wrote that Facebook temporarily suspended his account after the original post went viral. He had changed his name on the social media platform about a year ago, Bonner wrote, and Facebook required him to provide a govern: About a year ago, out of an abundance of caution due to what I did for a living, I changed how my name was displayed on Facebook. While no specific threats were made, there were plenty of general threats that I had a hard time ignoring. I would be devastated if harm came to my family or friends because of my chosen profession. Facebook suspended my account until my name could be Verified. The timing of it was interesting. They wanted me to provide government ID. Which ultimately I did not end up providing. End Result? As you can see my profile is back up and running. However, I feel like this won’t be the end of this type of “Contact.” Given that it’s not clear what Bonner’s real name is, there’s no way to confirm whether or not his account of Clinton is true. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Michelle Obama Plagiarized Her 2008 Democratic National Convention Speech-Disputed!","2016-07-21 10:18:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama-plagiarized-2008-democratic-national-convention-speech/"," Michelle Obama plagiarized her 2008 Democratic National Convention speech from Saul Alinsky or Stephen Covey, and then Melania Trump later plagiarized Michelle Obama’s speech. "," Michelle Obama’s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech was definitely influenced by Saul Alinksy and Stephen Covey — but whether or not her speech rose to the level of plagiarism is debatable. Claims that Michelle Obama had lifted portions of her speech surfaced immediately after she gave it in 2008. Blog sites immediately noted that two direct phrases in the future first lady’s speech appeared to be taken directly from Saul Alinsky’s book, “Rules for Radicals.” According to a transcript of her speech, Obama said: …And Barack stood up that day, and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since. He talked about “the world as it is” and “the world as it should be.” And he said that, all too often, we accept the distance between the two and we settle for the world as it is, even when it doesn’t reflect our values and aspirations. Two lines that appeared in quotations in the transcript — “the world as it is” and “the world as it should be” — appeared in the second chapter of Saul Alinksy’s “ Rules for Radicals ”: The standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as it is , not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be . Although those two phrases appeared in quotations in the transcript of Michelle Obama’s speech, she did not attribute them Alinsky during it. The definition of plagiarism is “the act of using another person’s words or ideas without giving credit to that person.” An argument can be made that Obama used Alinsky’s words and ideas in the speech without giving him credit. That’s why we’re calling that one disputed. Then, after Melania Trump was accused of copying portions of Michelle Obama’s speech, another plagiarism accusation was waged against Obama. This time, a viral Facebook meme claimed that Obama had lifted a portion of Stephen Covey’s book, “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” In question was this line that supposedly appeared in Stephen Covey’s book: There is only one sure means of success. Number one, work hard for what you want in life . Number two, treat your word as your bond and always do what you say you’re going to do . And number three, respect everyone and treat them with dignity even if you don’t know them or agree with them . And always, always, take the opportunity to pass the values on to the next generation. Several lines from that passage appear to match the portion of Michelle Obama’s speech that Melania Trump was accused of plagiarizing: And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: like, you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond; that you do what you say you’re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don’t know them and even if you don’t agree with them . However, we couldn’t that quote anywhere in “ The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People ,” and we couldn’t find any examples of Stephen Covey saying that elsewhere, either. It appears the passage did not come from Covey and the meme was created to intentionally mislead people into thinking that Michelle Obama had plagiarized her speech. That’s why we’re calling that claim “fiction.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Melania Trump Graduated from College with Degree in Architecture and Design-Reported as Fiction!","2016-07-20 10:17:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/melania-trump-graduated-from-college-with-degree-in-architecture-and-design/"," Despite claims made by Melania Trump and the Republican National Committee, Melania Trump didn’t graduate from college in Slovenia. "," Based on interviews with her former classmates and acquaintances, Melania Trump didn’t graduate from the University of Ljublana in Slovenia with a degree in architecture and design. Shortly after Melania Trump was accused of plagiarizing excerpts of a speech that Michelle Obama gave during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, rumors that Melania didn’t graduate from college, despite claims that she did, cropped up. A biography posted at Melania Trump’s personal website states that, “After obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia, Melania was jetting between photo shoots in Paris and Milan, finally settling in new in 1996.” That sentence gained scrutiny after the Republican National Committee repeated it word-for-word in the program for the 2016 Republican National Convention in Melania’s introductory statement: The claim the Melania Trump had earned a degree in architecture and design was contradicted by Slovenian journalists Bojan Pozar and Igor Omerza in their book, “ Melania Trump — The Inside Story: From a Slovenian Communist Vilalge to the White House .” The authors write, using her Slavic name, “Melanija Knavs”: In her freshman year, the 19-year old Melanija Knavs attended lectures on the following subjects: elements of architecture, fine arts, fundamentals of technical mechanics, architectural construction, descriptive geometry, mathematics, and an ideological (read “communist”) elective credit called “General Partisan Resistance and Social Self-protection”. Melanija would have made it to her sophomore year, even having failed 2 exams, but she was supposed to have gotten and held a 1-month internship and kept a journal about it. A GQ profile on Melania Trump explained that after she passed the “notoriously difficult” entrance exams for the local university’s school of architecture and design, her friends recalled Trump taking her studies very seriously and “didn’t want to waste time partying.” However, by her second year of college in 1992, Trump felt that she had outgrown Slovenia and left for Milan: By 1992—the year Melania won second place in a Slovenian Look of the Year modeling contest—she seemed to have outgrown not just Ljubljana but all of newly independent Slovenia. The large media market of Yugoslavia—with some 24 million people—had been chopped up. Staying in her tiny new country of 2 million would mean the end of her modeling career. To have a shot at something bigger, at a real future in modeling, she had to move. “She was sure that there was nothing for her in Slovenia,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She wanted to leave.” Melania decamped to Milan after her first year of college, effectively dropping out. Her connections to home grew faint. Sedej saw her for the occasional coffee on the rare occasions she visited Ljubljana, but has lost track of her since. She and her classmates wrote to Melania about their 20th high school reunion a few years ago. They e-mailed Melania’s representatives, they wrote to her on Facebook. There was no response. “She cut the line behind her,” says the friend from Ljubljana. “She started to live another life, and all this is behind her.” So, various reporters that have talked to Melania Trump, her family and school acquaintances have concluded that she “dropped out” of college to pursue a career in modeling. And, given that her schoolmates never talked about her returning to Slovenia or finishing her degree at the university, it appears that she never did. At the very least, the timeline of events listed her bio and the RNC program — that Melania pursued modeling after graduating from college — is false. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Architect Andrew Tesoro on Being Conned by Donald Trump-Truth!  & Misleading!","2016-07-19 10:52:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/architect-andrew-tesoro-conned-donald-trump/"," Hillary Clinton’s campaign has released a video in which New York architect Andrew Tesoro explains that Donald Trump’s organization didn’t pay his firm for thousands of dollars of design work on the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, New York. "," Andrew Tesoro’s claim that his architectural firm wasn’t paid in full by the Trump Organization appears to be true — but a few important details were left out of Hillary Clinton’s campaign video. Specifically, Andrew Tesoro said the project grew in scope during the design process and his final invoice included about $80,000 in additional costs for architectural services. While those costs were for changes that were approved by Trump, Tesoro said that he expected to have to renegotiate his final invoice with the Trump Organization. Andrew Tesoro firm was contracted to design the clubhouse at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, New York. In the video, Tesoro said, “Here he is in the very ballroom where I got bullied out of many thousands of dollars, making promises that are just like the promises that he made to me and didn’t keep.” Trump and his campaign have declined to comment on the allegations. But the Trump National Golf Club project does appear on Tesoro Architects’ website in the “case studies” section , along with a glowing review of the clubhouse from Trump himself: We designed the Westchester “manor” with a sense of luxury, relaxation, and sport. Large expanses of glass embrace the drama of the landscape and provide views to the golf course beyond. This is a golfer’s building, bustling from spring through autumn. Activities and gatherings, however, occur throughout the year. The Trump National Golf Club is designed for events held simultaneously in the dining and lounge areas while golfers can enjoy their club in small groups. An elegant palette of marble, millwork, and fixtures captures the essence of the Trump brand while incorporating design cues from historic Hudson Valley architecture. The clubhouse is clad with stone quarried on-site from the excavation process; timber construction of the 40-foot high centerpiece Grille Room utilizes traditional joinery with a contemporary flourish. “…Mr. Tesoro is a fine architect with imagination and spirit. [The Clubhouse] fits perfectly on its glorious hilltop site…rooms are beautifully proportioned, light-filled spaces…Andrew Tesoro is a dedicated, enthusiastic, talented, and solid professional… a top-notch architect.” – Donald J. Trump In an interview with Forbes , Andrew Tesoro said that the project had grown in scope throughout the design process. At the end, he was entitled to about $140,000 in outstanding payments, which included about $80,000 in additional architectural services that had been “directed, approved and implemented with Trump’s blessing,” when he was called to the clubhouse for negotiations with the Trump Organization. When he got there, Tesoro explained: I was startled at the bullying. These guys ganged up on me and basically said, there were cost overruns. They said, we’ll give you $50,000. Their message to me was take it or leave it. I was stunned. I left and made a bill for $50,000 and sent it. It wasn’t paid. When he didn’t receive a check for the $50,000 invoice, Tesoro said, he contracted Trump directly: I met with Mr. Trump. He said, you’re a nice guy, you’re a good architect, I’ll give you half of that $50,000. I walked away with $25,000. Given that his firm was so small, Tesoro said it wouldn’t be worth suing the Trump Organization for the remaining balance on the invoice. Tesoro accepted the $25,000 and opened lines of credit to keep his firm afloat in the meantime, he said. Still, Tesoro told Forbes that he liked Donald Trump on a personal level and believed that Trump was not “nearly as much of a demon as he often sounds like on the campaign trail.” So, based on Tesoro’s account, his architectural firm was underpaid by the Trump Organization for its design work on the clubhouse at Trump National Clubhouse in New York. However, Tesoro said that he expected to renegotiate the final invoice with the Trump Organization. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and misleading. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Attorney General Loretta Lynch Supports Summer of Chaos-Reported as Fiction!","2016-07-11 14:14:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/attorney-general-loretta-lynch-supports-summer-chaos/"," Attorney General Loretta Lynch supports the summer of chaos strategy of Black Lives Matter activists Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie. "," We’re reporting this one as fiction since there’s been no credible evidence provided to support the summer of chaos conspiracy theory, or the idea that Attorney General Loretta Lynch supports it. The rumor started shortly after Black Lives Matter and former Baltimore mayoral candidate Deray McKesson was arrested on a charge of obstructing a highway while protesting the death of Alton Sterling at the hands of police in Baton Rouge on July 9th. McKesson was released a day later. Many opponents of the Black Lives Matter movement, or of Deray McKesson, took to social media to celebrate McKesson’s arrest. One of the most vocal was a social media account of an individual identified as “The Saint,” whose social media handle is @TheSaintNegro29. Playing off of credible reports that Deray McKesson’s Twitter account had been hacked on July 8th, the twitter handle posted a screen grab of what appeared to show McKesson and Johnetta Elzie discussing their so-called “summer of chaos” plan, and Loretta Lynch’s support of it: Simply put, the summer of chaos plan is to supposedly cause so much chaos that President Obama can declare martial law, cancel the national conventions of both political parties and seek a third term in office. Or, an alternative end game is for Bernie Sanders to become president, supposedly. Aside from these screen grabs, there’s no proof that Black Lives Matter activists are undertaking a “summer of chaos” plan, or that Loretta Lynch has supported it. And these screen grabs did not come from a credible source. The Saint has a well-documented history of public deception (more on that later), and he seemed to indirectly admit that the screen grabs were a hoax on Twitter. He tweeted a screen grab of an interview with a passage underlined: “photoshopped tweets Trump supporters are dumb enough to believe,” and he commented, “In case anyone was wondering if the DMS I obtained from Deray’s acct were fake, here’s your answer”: Beside that, “The Saint” has a well-documented history of operating parody social media accounts that track media outlets and the general public into believing falsehoods. In January, The Saint described in an interview with the Washington Post how easy it was to trick national media outlets into believing he was Ammon Bundy on social media: The Saint” registered the parody account in the earliest hours of  Jan. 3, when he began tweeting a couple of real quotes that Bundy had given media. Within hours, his friends told him that they saw the account appear during a CNN broadcast — attributed to Bundy himself. “I was like ‘woah.’ I didn’t really expect anything to happen like that. That was not my intention,” he said. Soon after, reporters began reaching out to the parody account, expecting to reach Bundy through it.  It was at that point that he decided to see how far he could go until someone caught on that the account was fake — that happened Wednesday morning. The social media operator refused to be identified by name, but we know he is a white man from west Texas. He now operates a social media account from the perspective of a fictional black character to mock people, and Black Lives Matter activists in particular. The genre has become known as “digital black face”: The Saint’s account is known among his friends for his image manipulations , which often involve placing the mask image over the bodies and faces of black people — including in contexts that reference racial stereotypes. Some of his images and captions make fun of activists in the “Black Lives Matter” movement — particularly activist Shaun King. “The Saint” said that he believes some Black Lives Matter activists are fair game for his particular brand of mockery because they don’t want to have an “open discussion” on race and police brutality — and instead, he argued, automatically label those who disagree with them as white supremacists. Given The Saint’s history of public deception, and that he seemed to admit that he had photoshopped the direct messages about Loretta Lynch supporting the summer of chaos, we’re reporing this one as fiction.

"Oscar Rodriguez Thrown from Air Force Base for Referencing “God” in Speech-Disputed!","2016-06-21 13:45:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/oscar-rodriguez-thrown-air-force-base-referencing-god-speech/"," A decorated veteran named Oscar Rodriguez, Jr., was invited to give a speech at a flag folding ceremony held at an Air Force base but was dragged off stage for referencing “God.” "," Facts related to Oscar Rodriguez, Jr., being removed from an Air Force flag folding ceremony aren’t clear at this point. The situation unfolded at a retirement ceremony for Master Sergeant Charles “Chuck” Roberson in April 2016 at Travis Air Force Base. Video shows Oscar Rodriguez, Jr., stand to deliver a speech while two officers folded a flag during the ceremony. After delivering the opening lines, however, Roberson was pulled from the room by a number of uniformed soldiers from the audience: Our flag is known as the stars and stripes. The union consists of white stars on a blue field (sic) the new constellation. Each star represents one individual state, and together they stand united indivisible, the stripes represent the original 13 colonies that declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 … The story went viral in June after First Liberty, a legal organization “dedicated exclusively to protecting religious freedom for all Americans,” took up the case. In a letter to Air Force Major General John C. Flournoy, First Liberty alleged that: Upon discovering he lacked the authority to prevent Mr. Rodriguez—an invited guest—from attending the retirement ceremony as a guest, Lt Col Sovitsky informed retired MSgt Roberson he did not want Mr. Rodriguez to participate in the retirement ceremony as a speaker. Retired MSgt Roberson insisted that, as the retiring member, he desired that Mr. Rodriguez participate and offer the flag-folding speech. When relaying this information to Mr. Rodriguez, retired MSgt Roberson re-iterated his strong desire that Mr. Rodriguez participate as requested. In the days leading up to the April 3 retirement ceremony, both retired MSgt Roberson and Mr. Rodriguez attempted to work with members of the 749th AMXS command in order to resolve any issues. Retired MSgt Roberson and Mr. Rodriguez even went so far as to offer to place “warning signs” on the auditorium doors explaining that the word “God” would be uttered during the retirement ceremony. Retired MSgt Roberson’s retirement ceremony occurred as scheduled, with family, friends, and colleagues in attendance. In accordance with retired MSgt Roberson’s wishes, Mr. Rodriguez attended and sat in a prominent position that permitted him to perform the flag-folding speech at the appointed time. Towards the conclusion of the ceremony, there was a slide show with music and photos depicting various events throughout retired MSgt Roberson’s career. The flag-folding ceremony occurred after the slide show. Two Airmen who volunteered to perform the flag-folding ceremony took their positions. As Mr. Rodriguez stood to assume his position, Technical Sergeant (hereinafter, “TSgt”) Al Hall, a member of the 749th AMXS, approached Mr. Rodriguez and warned him not to perform the flag-folding speech. Desiring to keep his word and honor his colleague, Mr. Rodriguez stood fast and, as he began his flag-folding speech, TSgt Hall, assaulted Mr. Rodriguez by forcibly grabbing him. Moments later, 749th AMXS members Chief Master Sergeant (hereinafter, “CMSgt”) Antonio Cordes, CMSgt Denis Tharpe, and SMSgt Joe Bruno, immediately joined TSgt Hall’s assault and the group (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “four NCOs”) physically dragged Mr. Rodriguez out of the Building 185 Auditorium. For his part, Master Sergeant Charles Roberson has confirmed in a video uploaded to YouTube by First Liberty that he asked Oscar Rodriguez to deliver the speech during the flag-folding portion of his retirement ceremony: “That the Air Force would do this to myself as this was my retirement – I was very embarrassed and humiliated in front of my family and friends,” Roberson said. What’s not clear, however, is exactly why Oscar Rodriguez was not allowed to deliver the speech. The Air Force has rejected accusations that Oscar Rodriguez was not allowed to speak or was dragged from the room for referencing God, Stars and Stripes reports : The Air Force said Tuesday it was still preparing a response to allegations regarding the incident. But a spokeswoman said that while there is a non-religious flag-folding script for official military ceremonies, Air Force personnel are entitled to use a religious script for a retirement ceremony. “Since retirement ceremonies are personal in nature, the script preference for a flag-folding ceremony is at the discretion of the individual being honored and represents the member’s views, not those of the Air Force,” spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said. “The Air Force places the highest value on the rights of its personnel in matters of religion and facilitates the free exercise of religion by its members.” Given that the reason for why Oscar Rodriguez was not allowed to deliver the flag folding address are disputed and tied up in legal action, we’re calling this one “disputed” for now.

"Islamic Refugee Arrested With Gas Pipeline Plans in New Mexico-Fiction!","2016-06-17 09:23:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/islamic-refugee-arrested-gas-pipeline-plans-new-mexico/"," Police in New Mexico arrested an undocumented Islamic refugee who had plans to a gas pipeline located in the area. "," Local police have said reports of an undocumented Islamic refugee being arrested with gas pipeline plans are false. The story appeared at Judicial Watch on June 15, days after a terrorist attack left 50 dead at an Orlando nightclub, and under the headline, “’Islamic Refugee’ With Gas Pipeline Plans Arrested in New Mexico Border Country.” The story begins: Police in a U.S. town bordering Mexico have apprehended an undocumented, Middle Eastern woman in possession of the region’s gas pipeline plans, law enforcement sources tell Judicial Watch. Authorities describe the woman as an “Islamic refugee” pulled over during a traffic stop by a deputy sheriff in Luna County, New Mexico which shares a 54-mile border with Mexico. County authorities alerted the U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) has been deployed to the area to investigate, sources with firsthand knowledge of the probe confirm. The gas pipeline plans in the woman’s possession include the Deming region, law enforcement sources say. Deming is a Luna County city situated about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces. It has a population of about 15,000. Last year one local publication listed Deming No. 1 on a list of the “ten worst places” to live in New Mexico due to high unemployment , poverty, crime and a horrible public education system. The entire region is a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), according to the Justice Department’s National Drug Intelligence Center due to the large amounts of methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers. Specifically, the renowned Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in the area, the feds affirm in a report. Given the heightened sense of panic and frustration caused by the terrorist attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the story quickly went viral. However, local, state and federal authorities near the border in New Mexico have said that the report is completely false. KRQE News 13 reports that the FBI, U.S. Border Patrol and Luna County Sheriff’s Department all independently shot down the claims: Luna County Sheriff John Mooradian said officials from the U.S. Border Patrol called him Wednesday, asking if a deputy of his had made the arrest, as the article claimed. Mooradian checked with his patrol supervisor and confirmed none of his deputies made such a stop, let alone an arrest. Mooradian said he’d likely be fielding calls from concerned people in Luna County who live near the 54-mile border with Mexico. “Before putting out such an article that could put people in such an uproar, maybe they should confirm their stories,” Mooradian said. “…it’s really unfortunate to our citizens that they have to endure that kind of fear.” U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Doug Mosier, who works out of the agency’s El Paso office, told KRQE News 13 on Wednesday evening that the agency had “no information that would corroborate these allegations.” Frank Fisher, a spokesman for the FBI in Albuquerque said on Thursday that agents look into all such reports, but that the Judicial Watch article “does not appear to be substantiated.” Mooradian said he’d received several inquiries from other agencies, including the office of New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez. Press aides for Martinez did not return requests for comment from KRQE News 13. Judicial Watch has been behind previous false reports about terrorist plots and training camps, so this one should have raised questions right off the bat. The site also falsely reported that an ISIS training came had been found in Mexico ( click here for our coverage) and that Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines for human papilloma virus (HBV) have caused deaths ( click here for our coverage). This latest report appears to be another example of a story that was completely fabricated to cause panic and fear. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Claims about a directive from Secretary of the Army John McHugh’s directive to balance lactation support and readiness are true. McHugh’s Army Directive 2015-37, Breastfeeding and Lactation Support Policy, which went into effect in September 2015. An official summary of the policy states: Based on Secretary of the Army John McHugh-approved Army Directive 2015-37Breastfeeding and Lactation Support Policy, effective Sept. 29, 2015, commanders will designate a private space with locking capabilities, an electrical outlet, and access to a safe water source for Soldiers to express milk. If the designated space is within a restroom, it will be a fully enclosed, separate area designated for breastfeeding or expressing milk (i.e. not a bathroom stall). Army senior leaders expect commanders and Soldiers to collectively work to balance lactation support and readiness. The policy is not too prescriptive to afford commanders the flexibility to support the unique needs of women Soldiers who request breastfeeding and lactation support. One particular phrase in the passage has drawn criticism and commentaries about the transformation of the military under President Obama’s watch and current priorities: “Army senior leaders expect commanders and soldiers to collective work to balance lactation support and readiness.” The most blistering commentary about the Army’s lactation support policy came from retired Lt. Col. Fred DiBella. It first appeared in a community forum for the Westpoint class of 1969 that circulates commentaries among a closed group of subscribers. It was later shared as a forwarded email and has since appeared in countless forums. The commentary states, in part: Sorry, I’m old school, but I THOUGHT READINESS WAS NEVER, EVER COMPROMISED… let alone for “lactation support”. Have we gone completely mad?!? Do you think for a moment that the greatest fighting force the planet has ever known is immune to emasculation? That there’s nothing that Obama can do to significantly degrade its lethality?  That somehow we will magically prevail, despite all this sh**? We won’t weigh in on differing views about the Army’s lactation support policy since they’re shaped by personal opinions and not facts. However, we can confirm that the Army’s lactation support policy and the particular statement about balancing lactation support and readiness are true. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Donald Trump Was Never Accused of Racism Before Running for President-Fiction!","2016-05-19 10:32:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-never-accused-racism-running-president/"," A meme that claims Donald Trump has been in the public eye for 30 years and was never accused of racism before running for president has gone viral on social media. "," The claim that Donald Trump was never accused of being a racist before running for president is false. That rumor surfaced in the form of a meme on social media in mid-May, shortly after Donald Trump had all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination. The meme got traction after former MLB pitcher Kurt Schilling re-tweeted it on May 16th: But Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, were accused engaging in racially biased housing policies in 1973. The Department of Justice sued the Trump Management Corporation (Donald was its president at the time) for an “antiblack bias” in its housing policies that allegedly violated the Fair Housing Act, the New York Times reported in 1973: Donald Trump also faced accusations of racism after he took out a full-page ad in the New York Daily News that called for the death penalty for the “Central Park 5,” a group of black teenagers accused of raping and beating a jogger, in 1989, the New Yorker reports: And, in early May, 1989, Donald Trump took out a full-page ad in the Daily News to say what he thought he knew about the case. Trump was on the front page of the papers often enough that season; the Post’s “SPLIT!” headline marking the end of his marriage would help fill the tabloid space between the teen-agers’ arrest and their conviction, as did “MARLA BOASTS TO HER PALS ABOUT DONALD: ‘BEST SEX I’VE EVER HAD,’ ” which quoted his then-mistress and second wife; soon, there was also coverage of his baroque business failures. Perhaps he thought it gave him gravitas, that spring, to weigh in on the character of the teen-agers in the park: “How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!” And his headline suggested what ought to be done with them: BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE! The Central Park 5 were falsely convicted and served time in prison before the jogger’s real attacker came forward and the teens were cleared of the charges and released in 2002. Trump was also accused of “making racial slurs against black people” in the 1991 book “Trumped!” that was written by a former Trump casino executive named John O’Donnell, the Inquisitor reports : The book’s description of remarks by Trump about black people could be significant if proven accurate because Steven P. Perskie, the casino commission chairman, has ordered proceedings to ban a high-roller from the gambling halls for making similar remarks. O’Donnell described a dinner conversation with Trump in which, he writes, they discussed Trump Plaza’s financial executive, who was black. He quoted Trump as saying he never liked the man and believed he was not doing a good job. Trump’s conversation is recounted: “And isn’t it funny. I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” O’Donnell writes that he advised Trump against publicly espousing such views. Allegations that Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had removed black dealers from tables at the request of gamblers later landed Trump;s business in court, UPI reports : TRENTON, N.J. — The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino has lost a bid to overturn a $200,000 penalty imposed because managers catered to the presumed prejudices of a high roller by removing a black dealer from his table. A New Jersey appeals court upheld a ruling by the Casino Control Commission. The court also ruled that the penalty, one of the highest ever from the Division of Gaming Enforcement, was not disproprotionate to the offense. So, claims that Donald Trump was never accused of racism before running for president are false. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Obama Authorizes Kill Order for Bald Eagles-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-05-17 13:22:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-authorizes-kill-order-bald-eagles/"," A new rule handed down by President Obama would authorize wind farms to kill thousands of bald eagles, which amounts to a “kill order for bald eagles.” "," It’s true that the Obama administration released a plan in May 2016 that would allow wind-energy farms to legally kill four times more eagles per year. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s proposal would extend “eagle permits” that are issued to wind farms from five years to 30 years. The permits determine how many golden and bald eagles can be killed without penalty by wind turbines or other obstructions in their habitats, Reuters reports : …The Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the U.S. population of roughly 40,000 golden eagles could endure the loss of about 2,000 birds a year without being pushed toward extinction. And the agency suggested that bald eagles, estimated to number about 143,000 nationwide, could sustain as many as 4,200 fatalities annually without endangering the species. But just because U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes that bald eagle populations could endure 4,200 fatalities each year without threatening the species does not necessarily mean that’s going to happen. There’s no clear indication of exactly how many bald eagles and golden eagles are killed by wind farms each year — but the number of fatalities appears to be far fewer than the “thousands” of bald eagles that some outlets have reported would be killed each year under the proposal. A 2012 study published by the Fish and Wildlife Service found that wind energy facilities had killed at least 85 golden and bald eagles from 1997 to 2012 — but the report concluded that the number of fatalities could be much higher than that, National Geographic reports : Eagles are particularly vulnerable to wind turbine collision because of their flight behavior. They soar along ridges and in winds that can also attract wind developments. They tend to fly at the altitude of the turbine rotor-swept area, especially when they are hunting. And when they are hunting, their senses are focused on the ground looking for prey, not watching for spinning blades. The impact of wind farms on golden eagles became startlingly clear in 2004, when the California Energy Commission conducted a mortality study at Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area’s 5,400 turbines. Estimates of golden eagles killed at the Wind Resource Area are an average of 67 or more per year, along with thousands of other raptors and other birds. So, it’s true that the Obama administration has proposed increasing the number of bald eagles that could be killed by a wind farm each year without penalty. It’s does not, however, appear to be true that “thousands” of eagles will be killed each year, or that the proposal amounts to a “kill order for bald eagles.”","9-11 Attack on America"
"Breyers Ice Cream Does Not Melt-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-05-16 14:43:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/breyers-ice-cream-not-melt/"," A viral video claims that Breyers ice cream does not melt because it uses “modified milk ingredients” and not actual dairy products. "," Claims that Breyers ice cream doesn’t melt are both truth and fiction. That rumor started with a video that was posted on YouTube under the heading “You Will Never Eat This Ice Cream Again, Sickening Results!” in January 2016 at a channel operated by “Mr. Eastcoatsman.” By mid-may, the video had been viewed nearly 2 million times. The video demonstrates that Breyers brand ice cream doesn’t melt when left at room temperature for 10 days because it’s made with “modified milk ingredients.” Other ice cream brands made with “milk and cream,” meanwhile, melted quickly. The central claim that Breyers products (and other major brands) resist melting are true —but, oddly enough, the claim that these products are “ice cream” is false. Because Breyers does not meet specific FDA criteria for ice cream, these products are marketed at “frozen dessert products,” not ice cream. FDA has published very specific guidelines for what constitutes ice cream. It’s defined as “food produced by freezing, while stirring, a pasteurized mix consisting of one or more of the optional dairy ingredients specified.” Beyond that, the FDA has specific requirements that the weights of milkfat and total milk solids, as well as other ingredient ratios. Products that don’t meet these guidelines — including some, but not all, Breyers products — cannot be marketed as ice cream. Breyers has taken to the FAQ section of its website to explain why it markets products that don’t meet FDA ice cream guidelines as “frozen dessert products” and what it means for consumers: 5) What is a Frozen Dairy Dessert? Frozen Dairy Dessert products are made with many of the same high-quality ingredients that are commonly found in Ice Cream – like fresh milk, cream and sugar – and offer a great taste and even smoother texture. According to the FDA, in order for a product to be labeled ice cream, it needs to meet two key requirements: Not less than 10% dairy fat A percentage of overrun that results in a finished product weighing more than 4.5 pounds per gallon Anything that does not meet both of those requirements is not considered ice cream. 6) Why did Breyers make the change to Frozen Dairy Dessert? Our consumers are at the center of every recipe decision we make. We work hard to understand what people want most and work to give them the best possible product experience. People have told us they have various flavor or texture preferences. For example, some tell us that they want a smoother texture, which is what we’re able to deliver with our Frozen Dairy Dessert products. 7) Does Frozen Dairy Dessert taste different than Ice Cream? We have conducted several national taste tests across different flavor profiles to determine how our Frozen Dairy Dessert products perform against ice cream on important product attributes. In these side by side taste tests, our fans told us they liked the new recipe just as much as the original. The ultimate measure of consumer feedback is whether our consumers are purchasing the product. Breyers Blasts!, which has a Frozen Dairy Dessert standard of identity, is the most popular and fastest-growing segment of our business. 8) Are there nutritional benefits to Frozen Dairy Dessert? Frozen Dairy Dessert tends to have less fat than ice cream. 9) Are there Breyers flavors that are not Frozen Dairy Dessert? Yes, Breyers offers a wide range of products to meet the different taste, nutritional, and value needs of consumers. Breyers continues to offer many flavors of ice cream, including Natural Vanilla, Natural Strawberry, Chocolate, Mint Chocolate Chip and Coffee. 10) What is the packaging difference between Ice Cream and Frozen Dairy Dessert? These products follow all Legal & Regulatory requirements for packaging, and thus claim Frozen Dairy Dessert on the front of pack. Additionally, the ingredient list and nutritional information is updated to reflect changes. So, now that we’ve established why ice cream is different than frozen dessert products — why don’t frozen dessert products melt? As it turns out, the story went viral in 2012 when a mother from Ohio discovered that Walmart Great Value Ice Cream Sandwiches didn’t melt after an entire morning in 80 degree temperatures. Consumer Reports enlisted food scientists to uncover why these products didn’t melt at the time . They noted that the non-melting products had a rubbery, gummy feel while the real ice cream products melted cleanly in the mouth and left little residue behind. The common bond between the non-melting products were ingredients like guar gum, calcium sulfate and monoglycerides that are used to control the melting rates of frozen products and to prevent large crystal formations from forming in the products. When it comes to whether or not these additives are safe to consume, Linda Greene, a food scientist at Consumer Reports , explained that anyone who eats processed foods eats these additives on a regular basis: We’re talking about FDA approved additives. In the world of processed food, these are common ingredients. So, if your child is eating ice cream, soup, salad dressing, even some yogurts, they’re likely eating gums. So, it’s true that some “frozen dessert products” made by Breyers and other major labels resist melting at room temperature over long periods of time. However, these products technically aren’t considered ice cream, and the FDA considers additives used to make them safe. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Sally Miller Dishes on Hillary Clinton’s Coke Habit-Unproven!","2016-05-16 11:20:44","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sally-miller-dishes-hillary-clintons-coke-habit/"," Former Miss Arkansas Sally Miller, who claims that she had an affair with Bill Clinton in 1983, has said that Hillary Clinton had a coke habit, had multiple abortions and is secretly a lesbian. "," Sally Miller’s claims that Hillary Clinton had a coke habit, multiple abortions and relationships with women in the early 80s are unproven. Sally Miller first emerged on the public scene in 1992 during Bill Clinton’s first presidential campaign. Miller claimed that she had had an affair with Bill Clinton in 1983, but she didn’t provide any proof and her claims were largely dismissed due to concerns about her credibility — some of which were stoked by Clinton’s campaign, according to the book, “ The Hunting of a President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton ,” by reporters Joe Conason and Gene Lyons. Conason and Lyons wrote of Sally Miller, her allegations of an affair with Bill Clinton and the fallout in this section: It was much the same with Sally Miller Perdue, a fifty-three-year-old former Miss Arkansas. Regarded as kooky and unreliable by most reporters in her hometown of Pine Bluff, Perdue had once kicked off a quixotic campaign for mayor with a press conference strenuously denying that she was a lesbian– a charge nobody present had ever heard. Not long before the Democratic convention, the Clinton campaign learned, Lenora Fulani of the fringe New Alliance Party planned to launch her own presidential candidacy in a joint appearance with Perdue, who would detail what she claimed had been her own passionate love affair with Bill Clinton. The New Alliance Party was a strange, quasi-Marxist group based on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, whose members were mostly psychotherapy patients of the party’s leaders. (Eventually it dissolved into another group that was simultaneously allied to Louis Farrakhan and H. Ross Perot.) Behind the scenes, [notorious anti-Clinton smear merchants Larry] Nichols and [Larry] Case had helped broker the deal between Perdue and the eccentric New York activists. In their phone conversations, the two Arkansans had a derisive nickname for the New Alliance Party: “the Snake Doctors.” Clinton denied ever having met Sally Perdue. Assisted by Wright, the [Carl] Palladino [private investigation] firm lined up several relatives and former associates who agreed to talk to reporters about the woman’s eccentricities. The tactic succeeded. Although Perdue made an appearance on the nationally syndicated Sally Jessy Raphael TV program, no major news organization gave credence to her account. The National Enquirer , of all papers, derided Perdue’s tale under the headline “WEIRD CULT OUT TO DESTROY CLINTON.” As Hillary Clinton emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, Miller emerged once again. In January, Miller warned in a Facebook post that the Clinton’s might try to kill her, and right-wing outlets like Info Wars and The Blaze reported on the post. Then, in February, The Daily Mail , reported that Sally Miller was planning to release a “tell all” memoir that includes more secrets about the Clintons. The article reported that Miller planned to out Hillary Clinton as a lesbian. Then, in May, Sally Miller took her claims even further with a series of posts about the Clintons posted at The American Mirror , a site founded by right wing commentator Kyle Olson. Miller wrote about it in an article headlined, “Hillary and Her ‘Coke Habit’”: When I asked Bill if he shared his fantasies with Hillary, he laughed. “What a joke! Sex is a waste of time to Hillary. When we were dating, she talked about making-out with her girlfriends in college because she knew it turned me on. Hillary seemed worldly and more sexually-experienced than me and, at the time, I liked it.” “Before we married, I got her pregnant and she had an abortion. It bothered me because I didn’t know about it until it was over. Then, several months after the wedding, she slipped up again because she was too lazy to take the pill. “Hillary hates kids. She was one nasty bitch when she was pregnant. My God, for nine months, she made my life a living hell and blamed me! “From the beginning, our political advisors warned us that Hillary must take my last name and concentrate on having a child if I was going to have a future in politics. I saw the real Hillary after we got married. “She’s a damn frigid bitch who prefers women; she won’t even compromise and be bi-sexual. All I hear is how much she despises penises; she thinks they are fucking ugly, like snakes.” Bill mentioned, “The only time Hillary gets aroused or agree to ‘play sexy’ is after she snorts coke. But, even then, she’s rigid and frigid. Hillary goes ape-shit crazy–I mean screams, hits, and cusses–if I touch her breasts! Right after we started fooling around, she warned me to stay away from her tits, even telling me: ‘If you want to nurse–go home to your momma!’” Sally Miller has been tied up with Clintons in one way or another for more than 25 years. Still, during all that time, there hasn’t been any evidence presented to back up Miller’s central claim that she had an affair with Bill Clinton in 1983, or that he told his and Hillary’s deepest darkest secrets to her during that time. For that reason, we’re calling Sally Miller’s claims “unproven” at this point. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Henry Ford Invented the 5-Day Work Week-Mostly Truth!","2016-05-04 18:02:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/henry-ford-invented-the-5-day-work-week/"," It’s been rumored that Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford created the five-day, 40-hour workweek. "," It’s true that Henry Ford was first manufacturing leader who set five-day workweeks for his employees. Ford first made waves in 1914 when he announced that he’d pay his factor workers $5 a day, more than double what they had previously made. There’s a common misconception that Ford believed that paying his employees more would mean that more of them could afford to buy Model T cars. However, in reality, Ford realized that he was losing lots of money hiring and training new employees to replace the ones who quit, Forbes reports : At the time, workers could count on about $2.25 per day, for which they worked nine-hour shifts. It was pretty good money in those days, but the toll was too much for many to bear. Ford’s turnover rate was very high. In 1913, Ford hired more than 52,000 men to keep a workforce of only 14,000. New workers required a costly break-in period, making matters worse for the company. Also, some men simply walked away from the line to quit and look for a job elsewhere. Then the line stopped and production of cars halted. The increased cost and delayed production kept Ford from selling his cars at the low price he wanted. Drastic measures were necessary if he was to keep up this production. Then, in 1926, Henry Ford introduced an even more radical idea: the five-day workweek. Before that, Ford employees worked six eight-hour days a week. Ford explained his reasoning in October 1926, Time report s: Ford’s next act came in September 1926, when the company announced the five-day workweek. As he noted in his company’s Ford News in October, “Just as the eight-hour day opened our way to prosperity in America, so the five-day workweek will open our way to still greater prosperity … It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either lost time or a class privilege.” The five-day week, he figured, would encourage industrial workers to vacation and shop on Saturday. Before long, manufacturers all over the world followed his lead. “People who have more leisure must have more clothes,” he argued. “They eat a greater variety of food. They require more transportation in vehicles.” Taking advantage of his own wisdom, he discontinued the Model T and then, on a Saturday, launched the Model A. The 1927 unveiling would see 10,534,992 people visiting dealerships just to glimpse the latest product of the Sage of Dearborn. However, Labor Historian Clete Daniel offers an alternative idea for why Henry Ford decided to invent the five-day workweek. Ford realized that they would be much more productive and dedicated when working five days a week: There were some companies particularly in the 1920s that decided long hours would undermine their work forces through the long-term effects of long hours. Companies like General Electric and U.S. Rubber. Employers decided the way to maximize their labor pools was not by long hours, but by winning them over. In this era, employers stressed it was in employees’ best interest to be as productive as possible. Through this concept of welfare capitalism, companies became benefactors; and employees gained shorter work hours, but also sick benefits and health insurance. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company espoused the idea that if you made these concessions, you could actually put greater demands on employees. When Ford created the five-day workweek (instead of six) people thought he was a radical, but he proved that he could achieve as much in production in five days as six. The 40-hour workweek officially became law in 1939 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law a package of labor laws that covered maximum hours, mandatory overtime and child labor protections. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," It’s true that a paramedic rescued the same doctor who saved his life as a baby. A meme showing a picture of a doctor and the paramedic who saved each others life has been making its way around Twitter, but it started with the Unbelievable Facts blog site : In 1981, a pediatrician saved the life of a 3.2-pound premature baby boy by working around the clock to beat the odds & stabilize him. In 2011, the pediatrician was pinned inside a burning vehicle after a car collision, but was saved by the premature baby, who had grown up to become a paramedic. The story (and photo) comes from a March 2015 KTLA report about Dr. Michael Shannon and Paramedic Chris Trokey reuniting childhood cancer research fundraiser four years after Trokey saved Shannon’s life — and 30 years after Shannon saved Trokey’s life: Exactly four years ago, on March 29, 2011, Dr. Michael Shannon was driving on Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point when a semi-truck T-boned his SUV, pinning his vehicle underneath the truck as it caught fire. Firefighters from Paramedic Engine 29 were returning from another call and responded within minutes to the fiery crash. By the time they arrived, Shannon’s vehicle was also ablaze and the flames were burning his legs. Fire crews then worked to extinguish the flames and rescue him using the Jaws of Life. The seriously injured Shannon was taken to Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo where he spent the next 45 days recovering from internal injuries. He also had to have two of his toes amputated. Among those who had helped save Shannon that day was Orange County Fire Authority paramedic Chris Trokey, whose own life had been saved 30 years earlier by the pediatrician. “I didn’t know about until I went to the hospital and started talking about it, Dr. Shannon. And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, Dr. Shannon?'” Trokey recalled on Sunday. “That’s when I found out.” The story goes on to report that Trokey was given a 50-50 chance of survival when he was prematurely born weighing 3.2 pounds, but Dr. Shannon stayed with him around the clock until his health approved and he stabilized.

"Dying Veteran Bill Schoonover’s Letter to Senators-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-03-09 09:55:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dying-veteran-bill-schoonovers-letter-to-senators/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Dying Veteran Bill Schoonover’s Letter to Senators- Authorship Confirmed! An open letter to senators written by a dying veteran named Bill Schoononver about government waste and abuse of power has gone viral. "," A veteran named Bill Schoonover did in fact wrote this open letter. The letter to U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and U.S. Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) appeared on conservative blog sites in September 2013, and it has been widely circulated in chain emails and discussion forums ever since. Let’s start with what we know about its author, Bill Schoonover. Schoonover identified himself as a retired lieutenant colonel in a guest book entry from 2011 for the 97th Engineer Battalion, a construction detail based in France in the mid to late 1950s. Today, Bill Schoonover is listed as a resident of Oak Harbor, Washington. That makes claims that the 2013 open letter was written by a “dying” questionable. No information about his health was readily available, but Schoonover regularly submits letters to the editor of a local newspaper, and his last entry was published in November 2015. So, as of the end of 2015 — more than two full years after the open letter first appeared — Schoonover was alive and well enough to write letters to the editor. Now we’ll turn our attention to a few of the claims Bill Schoonover made in his open letter. Schoonover argues that President Obama has been living large and “spent an estimated 1.4 $billion on himself and his family.” It’s true that the White House budget was $1.4 billion in 2012, but the idea that that can be blamed on the Obama family’s extravagant spending is misleading. According to a paper by the Brooking Institution’s Bradley Patterson, questions about how much it costs to operate the White House are complicated: What are the annual dollar costs, for a typical year, of operating the modern presidency—of running the White House, the whole White House? One of the reasons that question has never been answered (and perhaps never even asked) is because the pathway to the answer is so complicated. One may start with the tab “White House Office” in the annual congressional budget submission of the Executive Office of the President, but that is only an initial fraction. In addition, twenty-two other budget accounts, thirteen of them in other departments, or parts of departments, pay the expenses, and the salaries, of men and women who are in fact members of the White House staff family. Not only are those costs scattered through those twenty-two other budgets, but in at least nine of them the dollars are not in any fashion identified as White House. Realistic estimates have to be made. Patterson estimated that the White House budget (excluding classified expenses for things like Air Force One) was about $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2008. That’s important because the government’s fiscal year 2008 ran from October 2007 to September 2008, so it encompassed the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Obama. And if those rough estimates are any indication, there wasn’t a big jump in White House spending under Obama, and there was actually a slight decline. It’s fair to argue that the cost of maintaining the White House has become too expensive for all presidents — but it’s not fair to pin that on the Obama family. In reality, operational costs of the White House are roughly the same for Democrats and Republicans. Schoonover also takes aim at the amount of time Obama has spent on vacation, noting that Obama had spent 92 days on vacation over the first five years of his presidency. Some commentators have noted that presidents are never truly on vacation because there are always briefings, meetings and phone calls to answer. But another important point is that Obama’s vacation time isn’t unusual as far as presidents go. An ABC News review found that compared to past presidents, Obama had actually spent less time on vacation by the end of 2014: However, compared to past presidents, Obama has taken relatively few vacation days. At this point in his second term, former President George W. Bush had taken a whopping 405 vacation days. Before him, Bill Clinton took a total of 174 days for himself. Another big vacationer was Ronald Reagan, who took a total of 390 days during his time in office. In comparison, Obama has only taken 161 vacation days to date. So, again, it’s fair to argue that presidents in general take too many vacations. But since Obama has actually taken less time off than other modern presidents, it’s not fair (or accurate) to single him out for extravagance. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Hitler’s Slogan Was “Make Germany Great Again”-Fiction!","2016-03-07 09:33:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hitlers-slogan-make-germany-great/"," Some have said that Adolph Hitler’s slogan, “Make Germany great again,” is very similar to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America great again.” "," There’s no historical record of Hitler using the slogan “Make Germany great again.” It’s true that returning Germany to a position of strength in the world was a central them in Nazi propaganda, but that doesn’t mean Donald Trump got the idea to “Make America great again” from Hitler. After all, restoring strength, or making a nation “great” again, is a generic political idea that has been used over and over again throughout history (more on that later). In reality, Hitler’s campaign was more specific than a general promise of German greatness. Hitler promised to prevent the spread of communism, to break the Treaty of Versailles, to end trade unions, to create jobs, to restore strong central government, and to emphasize moral values, according to the BBC . His propaganda, and slogans, hit on these specific points rather than the general idea of making Germany great again. Translated into English, some of the best-known Nazi slogans were “ work sets you free ” and “ One people, one empire, one leader .” But propaganda was literally everywhere in Nazi Germany, and it would be impossible to go through every single poster and banner for references to the slogan “Make Germany great again,” especially since that’s such a generic idea. In reality, Donald Trump borrowed the “Make America Great Again” slogan from modern day conservative heroes, not Hitler. Ronald Reagan used that same exact slogan on a campaign poster in 1980: Another conservative icon, Margaret Thatcher used the slogan in the lead up to her election as prime minister of Britain. It was also the theme of her 1950 general election address: THE first task that awaits the new Government is that of setting the finances of the nation in order. Few people understand all the ‘in and outs’ of economics and national finances, but all of us know only too well that something is very seriously wrong with our country’s economic position. We are at present receiving help from abroad, especially from our American friends, help which amounts to £1 per week for every household. This will end in 1952 and from then on we’ve got to support ourselves. The Socialist Election Manifesto makes no mention of American help at all, and therefore completely fails to face the economic situation, which is the essence of our livelihood. We Conservatives are not afraid to face the future whatever problem it entails, because it is our earnest desire to make Great Britain great again. So, in conclusion, we’re calling this rumor false for two reasons. First, there’s no record of the specific slogan “Make Germany Great Again” ever being used by Hitler, even though the general idea of restoring German greatness was a common theme. Second, it’s far more likely that Donald Trump borrowed the phrase from Ronald Reagan, who, in turn, borrowed it from Margaret Thatcher. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"General John J. Pershing Dipped Bullets in Pig’s Blood-Unproven!","2016-02-22 09:42:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/general-john-j-pershing-dipped-bullets-in-pigs-blood/"," After General John J. “Black Jack” Pershing captured 50 Islamic terrorists in the Philippians in the early 1900s, he dipped bullets used to execute them in pig’s blood to deter future terrorists. "," The tale of Major General John J. Pershing dipping bullets in pig’s blood before using them to execute terrorists in the Philippians is an urban legend that can’t be proven true or false. The urban legend, which has been circulating in emails and discussion forums since 2001, got new life in February 2016 when Donald Trump re-told the story during a campaign stop in South Carolina. Trump’s retelling sparked controversy and questions from those who wondered if the story of General Pershing was true. The short answer is that nobody knows. General Pershing’s definitive biography, “ Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing ” doesn’t make any mention of an order to dip bullets in pig’s blood. The order didn’t appear in detailed reports of Pershing’s actions as the of governor of the “Bangasamoro” province of the Philippians, where this supposedly happened, either. But that doesn’t mean General Pershing didn’t give the order unofficially, or simply excluded it from official records. “Black Jack” supposedly gave the pig’s blood order in response to the Moro, an indigenous population of Muslims in the Philippians’ Bangsamoro region, terrorizing U.S. forces there. The Moro had resisted Spanish attempts to colonize and convert them to Catholicism for centuries. The U.S. claimed the Philippians as a territory after the Spanish-American War, and that’s where this urban legend begins. General Pershing was the governor of the Moro province from 1909 to 1913. By that time, U.S. forces had been clashing with the Moro for nearly eight years. Pershing was viewed as a “relatively progressive administrator” and he enacted a number of changes to promote trade, contract law, the legal system and to donate government land for the building of mosques. Still, Moro hostility led Pershing to issue an executive order to disarm the natives of their weapons. The Moros resisted and killed a U.S. soldier in a counter attack. Many Moros fled to Bud Jajo, a mountain they believed was sacred, and a standoff ensued. Three weeks later, with food and supplies cut off, the Moro holdouts fled and were captured, The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars reports : Pershing reported 300 Moros taken prisoner. Casualties for the entire campaign on the American side were 3 wounded. One the Moro side, 12 were killed a few others wounded. Pershing sent the prisoners to Mindanao to be tried for insurrection. Later he decided to drop the charges if a prisoner’s friends could collect sufficient arms for his release. Although it had a very successful operation, Moro resistance was not ended until the Battle of Bud Basak in June 1913. These details are important the urban legend about General Pershing’s pig’s blood order. In the official account, Pershing captured Muslim natives after a long stand off, but ultimately decided to release them for “sufficient arms” surrendered. That’s a far cry from dipping bullets in pig’s blood and executing them, as the urban legend claims. And General Pershing gave a detailed account of the Battle of Bud Basak, which finally crushed the Moros’ armed resistance in June 1913, in his memoirs . There’s no mention of bullets dipped in pig’s blood there, either. It should also be noted that Pershing had recommended turning the region over to local control before the final battle, too. So, there’s nothing in official records to indicate that General Pershing actually called for bullets to be dipped in pig’s blood before being used to execute Muslim prisoners. But, again, that doesn’t mean that an unofficial order wasn’t made at some point by Pershing, or by another U.S. military leader. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Hillary Clinton’s Personal Email Server Compromised Special Access Program (SAP) Materials-Unproven!","2016-02-08 13:43:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillary-clintons-personal-email-server-compromised-special-access-program-sap-materials/"," It’s been reported that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server led to the most sensitive government information, called Special Access Program (SAP) intelligence, being compromised. "," There have been rumblings that Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server led to SAP intelligence being compromised, but no proof of that has been released yet. Rumors that Hillary Clinton had compromised SAP intelligence that was classified “beyond top secret” gained traction when details of an inspector general report emerged in January 2016. FOX News obtained a letter from Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough that said Clinton’s private server contained emails with intelligence known as “special access programs” or SAP, according to a report : “To date, I have received two sworn declarations from one [intelligence community] element. These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined by the IC element to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,” said the IG letter to lawmakers with oversight of the intelligence community and State Department. “According to the declarant, these documents contain information derived from classified IC element sources. Intelligence from a “special access program,” or SAP, is even more sensitive than that designated as “top secret” – as were two emails identified last summer in a random sample pulled from Clinton’s private server she used as secretary of state. Access to a SAP is restricted to those with a “need-to-know” because exposure of the intelligence would likely reveal the source, putting a method of intelligence collection — or a human asset — at risk. Currently, some 1,340 emails designated “classified” have been found on Clinton’s server, though the Democratic presidential candidate insists the information was not classified at the time. Additional details of the inspector general findings were not made available. It’s not clear what SAP intelligence was found in Hillary Clinton’s private email server. For her part, Clinton told NPR that the SAP allegations were “a continuation of an interagency dispute that has been going on now for some months,” and she brushed off the allegations as a smear tactic: “As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified, and that hasn’t changed in all of these months,” she maintained. “This, seems to me, to be, you know, another effort to inject this into the campaign. It’s another leak.” Clinton added, “I’m just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department, because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified. She said “the best we can determine” is that the emails in question were a forward of a New York Times article on a classified drone program and that they had likely been retroactively classified. “How a New York Times public article that goes around the world could be in any way viewed as classified, or the fact that it would be sent to other people off of the New York Times site, I think, is one of the difficulties that people have in understanding what this is about,” Clinton said. Again, it’s not clear what SAP intelligence were found in the articles, or if any was found at all. Without more details, it’s impossible to make a determination on claims that Hillary Clinton compromised SAP intelligence. Those rumors gained traction when a man named Ed Coet, who identified himself as a retired Army intelligence officer, blogged that if the allegations were true, and Hillary Clinton did compromise SAP intelligence, there’s no way she should avoid criminal charges: As a former SAP program manager I believe it is inconceivable that if it is verified that Hillary Clinton’s server actually had SAP information on it that she could possibly escape indictment and criminal prosecution. As hard as it is to imagine, that would even be worse than electing to not prosecute a mass murdering serial killer because even they could not inflict as much damage on our country as the compromise of a SAP. Compromise of a SAP not only could but without doubt would cause serious damage to our national security. If it is true that Hillary Clinton had SAP information on her unsecure server, whether is was marked or not, you can be sure that the FBI WILL bring charges against Hillary Clinton and do an exhaustive investigation to trace back to every single person that had even the tiniest role in this unbelievable security compromise. If the Attorney General, through “prosecutorial discretion,” elected not to prosecute this crime I believe congress would have no alternative but to impeach her and the FBI would have no choice but to conduct a criminal investigation of her for a deliberate cover up – so grave is this security violation. As for Ed Coet, we weren’t able to independently verify that he served as an intelligence officer in the Army. Coet has a fairly extensive online footprint, however. He posted on a “Resisting the New World Order” discussion forum in 2013 that President Obama was “purging our military’s most senior ranks to make possible the forced disarming of America.” Ed Coet also posted a YouTube video in September 2015 called “I’m White and I’m Right” in which he outlined his conservative political beliefs and argued against the concept of white privilege. Again, it’s impossible to determine whether or not the Clinton SAP allegations are true due to slack of information. Without more details, any claims about federal prosecution or consequences for the alleged intelligence breech are premature. ","9-11 Attack on America"

McGruder’s original comic ran on June 7, 2013: That’s likely why “with apologies to Aaron McGruder” appears in the top right corner of each comic strip. Given that Dixon Diaz wasn’t the creator of the original comic strips, and he likely didn’t have permission to use McGruder’s artwork, the comics never appeared in the LA Times . That’s why we’re calling this one fiction. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Bernie Sanders Wants a 90% Income Tax Rate-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-02-04 09:56:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bernie-sanders-proposes-90-income-tax-rate/"," Bernie Sanders wants to raise the income tax rate to 90%. "," Bernie Sanders once said that a 90% income tax rate for top earners “wouldn’t be too high,” but he later said he wouldn’t support that if elected president. Rumors that Bernie Sanders wants to raise the income rate to 90% for top earners can be traced back to an interview that he gave to CNBC in May 2015 . During the interview, referenced the “highest marginal tax rate” under President Eisenhower as “something like 90%.” When pressed by CNBC’s John Harwood, Sanders said he didn’t think that rate would be too high: HARWOOD: Have you seen some of the quotations from people on Wall Street, people in business? Some have even likened the progressive Democratic crusade to Hitler’s Germany hunting down the Jews. SANDERS: It’s sick. And I think these people are so greedy, they’re so out of touch with reality, that they can come up and say that. They think they own the world. What a disgusting remark. I’m sorry to have to tell them, they live in the United States, they benefit from the United States, we have kids who are hungry in this country. We have people who are working two, three, four jobs, who can’t send their kids to college. You know what? Sorry, you’re all going to have to pay your fair share of taxes. If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent. HARWOOD: When you think about 90 percent, you don’t think that’s obviously too high? SANDERS: No. That’s not 90 percent of your income, you know? That’s the marginal. I’m sure you have some really right-wing nut types, but I’m not sure that every very wealthy person feels that it’s the worst thing in the world for them to pay more in taxes, to be honest with you. I think you’ve got a lot of millionaires saying, “You know what? I’ve made a whole lot of money. I don’t want to see kids go hungry in America. Yeah, I’ll pay my fair share.” But during a Democratic presidential debate in the following November, Bernie Sanders said that he would not support raising the top income tax rate to 90% after all. Sanders said , “We haven’t come up with an exact number yet … but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90%.” Sanders’ campaign hasn’t released any more information on his proposed tax policies, so it’s unclear what top interest tax rate he would support for America’s richest. There’s confusion about who, exactly, would be subject to the higher income tax rate. A marginal tax rate only applies to income above a set level. That means the higher tax rate would only apply to annual earnings above about $410,000 for individuals, or $460,000 for couples. Overall, about 1.3 million people would be subject to the higher tax rate (only on income above those thresholds). And it’s true that the top marginal tax rate was 90% under President Eisenhower. President Kennedy slashed the top marginal tax rate to 70% during his presidency. President Reagan slashed the top marginal rate to 50% and then to below 40%, which is where it remains today, according to historical tax data provided by the Tax Foundation .

Reports of Chic-fil-A’s missing man table began spreading in November 2015. A customer at Chic-fil-A in Marietta, Georgia, named Eric Comfort posted a photo of the missing man table at the restaurant on Facebook, and it quickly went viral: Alex Korchan, store manager of the Marietta Chic-fil-A, told an Atlanta news station that Missing Man tables would appear at locations throughout the Atlanta market: Store manager Alex Korchan said the table, which features a letter and folded American flag and place setting for the veteran, is just part of the way the store is honoring veterans. “Our team just decided we wanted to honor veterans and do a setup honoring military,” Korchan said. On Wednesday, which is Veterans Day, Chick-fil-A will offer a free meal to veterans and their immediate families from 5 to 8 p.m. Korchan said the whole Atlanta market for Chick-fil-A is doing military appreciation in some way.

"Health Dangers of Keurig Coffee Machines-Misleading!","2016-01-25 14:11:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/health-dangers-of-keurig-coffee-machines-misleading/"," Rumors that Keurig coffee machines harbor bacteria have been circulating the web for years. "," Mold and bacteria grows on and in Keurig coffee machines, but the same is true for every other kitchen appliance. Rumors about the dangers of Keurig coffee makers can be traced back to a blog post headlined “Why I Kicked My Keurig to the Curb.” It has appeared on alternative health and wellness websites since 2014. The post reports : When I packed up my kitchen to move 500 miles south, I wanted to make sure that my Keurig was completely empty and dry before it went on the moving truck. IMPOSSIBLE! Keurig.com states, “Once your Keurig home brewer has been primed, you cannot empty the water from the inside. The internal tank of the brewer cannot be drained.” The microbiologist in me is disgusted at the thought. Back in the day when I worked in a hospital lab, we emptied all water reservoirs daily or they would grow bacteria and a biofilm could develop. You are familiar with biofilms if you ever cleaned the goo out of a flower vase after the flowers have died. Biofilms are found wherever there is water and a surface to stick to (like your shower curtain). The author of the post doesn’t make any specific scientific claims about mold or bacteria growth in Keurig coffee makers. Instead, she implies that internal Keurig water reservoirs have to be filled with mold and bacteria because they can’t be emptied. When an ABC news affiliate from Pennsylvania put that claim to the test, however, the bacteria and mold theory didn’t hold water. The station turned to researchers at the Harrisburg University School of Science and Technology to test three Keurig machines for mold and bacteria. The results showed plenty of bacteria on the outside of the machines (mostly from human touching. Swabs from inside the machines came back clean. Leena Pattarkine, a doctor of microbiology at the university, explained: “The internal piping you cannot clean. You cannot completely drain it,” Pattarkine said. We tested water coming out of the machine, it came back clean. But there’s always a chance bacteria or mold could seep out into your cup of joe. “It doesn’t take too long to realize ‘hey I had that coffee, tasted something off or it was smelly,’ or ‘I had that and I felt sick, nauseated or something,’ ” Pattarkine said. In other words, mold and bacteria that can get into your coffee would most likely come from the outside of your Keurig. That much is true for other types of coffee makers and kitchen appliances, too. In fact, scientists in Spain reported in December 2015 that potentially harmful bacteria grows in most types of coffee makers, but coffee itself works as an antibacterial agent: Overall, the bacteria found in coffee waste were similar across all 10 machines, but were highly variable within each community, with up to 67 genera identified in a single machine. The team from the Universitat de València says these bacteria have to be pretty hardy to survive in coffee machines – the coffee itself is an antibacterial agent, and the machines consistently reach temperatures of up to 96°C. So, it’s true that mold and bacteria can grow on Keurig coffee makers, but health risks and warnings have been overblown. That’s why were classifying this one as “misleading.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Obama Cried Fake Tears at Press Conference-Reported as Fiction!","2016-01-07 15:08:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-cried-fake-tears-at-press-conference-on-background-checks/"," It’s been rumored that President Obama used Vicks VapoRub or a cut onion to summon tears at a press conference on executive action on background checks for some gun purchases. "," There’s no evidence to support speculation that President Obama cried fake tears while talking about the Sandy Hook Massacre at a press conference. Right-wing critics of Obama have speculated that the president used trickery to summon “fake tears” while talking about the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that left 20 first graders dead in 2012. Obama becomes choked up around the 34-minute mark of a video of the press conference . “…First graders in New Town. First graders. And for every family that never imagined that their loved one would be taken from their lives from a bullet from a gun,” the president paused and choked back tears, “Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day…” An article posted on Glenn Beck’s website under the headline “Obama’s Tears: Real or Manufactured?” questioned whether the president had rubbed Vicks VapoRub beneath his eyes to induce tears with its strong menthol scent. The article quoted Beck: “I was fascinated by the the fact that he [Obama] reached up to touch his eye before there were any tears,” Glenn said. “He reached up to his eye, and he was like, ‘And I’m really feeling horrible now, and I have to reach up to my eye where there is no tear,’ and then suddenly that eye would not stop tearing. It was fascinating.” Glenn Back once used Vicks VapoRub to induce tears during a photo shoot, so he does have experience with it ( a video of Beck sobbing uncontrollably during the shoot can be viewed here ). Still, Beck doesn’t offer any evidence that Obama used Vicks VapoRub to cry fake tears. Also, the way that Obama cried during the press conference looks nothing like Beck’s uncontrollable crying with VapoRub beneath his eyes. Others have suggested that Obama used cut onions to cry fake tears — but again, there’s nothing to lend that claim any credibility. This isn’t the first time Obama has shed tears over the Sandy Hook massacre, either. The president also became choked up and wiped a tear from his eye during a press conference held immediately after the shooting in 2012. Again, many of Obama’s critics accused him of crying “crocodile tears” back then, too. So, because there no evidence that Obama cried fake tears during the press conference, we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Sharia Showdown Looms in Brussels-Outdated!","2015-12-21 09:28:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sharia-showdown-looms-in-brussels/"," Muslims have become the largest religious group in Belgium, and a group called Sharia4Belgium is pushing to impose Sharia Law there, according to viral reports. "," Rumors of a “Sharia showdown” in Brussels are outdated. Sharia4Belgium disbanded in 2012 when its leaders were arrested for supporting terrorism. Forty-five of its members were sentenced to prison and a judge said Sharia4Belguim was a “terrorist organization.” Word that a “Sharia Showdown Looms in Brussels” first surfaced in early 2012. The Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) reported on the efforts of Sharia4Belguim to impose Sharia Law there and elsewhere in Europe in March of that year: The broadcast said that Sharia4Belguim was behind the Sharia showdown. The “most confrontational” Muslim group in Brussels interrupted a public debate between moderate Muslims, and reporter Dale Hurd Spoke with Abu Imram, the leader of the group, who said that Muslims would rule Belgium, and the world: We believe that Sharia will dominate. Sharia will be implemented worldwide… Sharia is Islam, to be clear. There is no difference between Islam and Sharia, it’s just a name. Democracy is the opposite of Islam and Sharia. We believe that Allah is the legislator, Allah make the laws, he tells us what’s allowed and forbidden. The report went viral in 2012 and sparked fear that radical Islamists led by Sharia4Belguim would take over Brussels, the capital of Europe. Shortly after the CBN report, however, the leaders of Sharia4Belguim were arrested for supporting terrorism, and the group fell apart. A massive trial played out in Antwerp over the next three years, and a judge sentenced 45 members of a Sharia4Belguim to prison in February 2015, the BBC reports The group sent recruits to militant groups such as Islamic State (IS), prosecutors said. Only seven of the accused were at the court for the ruling. Most others are said to still be in Syria, and some may already be dead. One high-profile member, Jejoen Bontinck, got a suspended sentence of 40 months. He made headlines after his father travelled to Syria and brought him home, and later appeared in the trial as a prosecution witness. Prosecutors said Fouad Belkacem brainwashed dozens of young men to fight with jihadi groups in Syria. The court heard evidence that he used lectures and social media to recruit and radicalise people. Some of the witnesses accused him of indoctrinating them. Prosecutors also presented wiretaps and video images as evidence which, they argued, proved Sharia4Belgium members were involved in terror activities. Mr Belkacem denied the charges against him. In an open letter to the press he said that he “never recruited, incited or sent” fighters to Syria. His lawyers argued that he did not buy anyone flights to Syria or introduce his followers to jihadists. Still, just seven of the 45 members of a Sharia4Belgium were present at the sentencing hearing. The other 38 member were believed to be dead or still fighting in Syria, Vice reports : The correctional tribunal in the port city of Antwerp sentenced Fouad Belkacem, the group’s 32-year-old leader who goes by the alias “Abu Imran,” to 12 years in prison. The other 44 members on trial were sentenced to between three and 15 years in jail, with some of the sentences being suspended. This is the biggest-ever trial of its kind in Belgium. Only seven defendants were present in court, with the remainder believed to be either dead or still fighting in Syria. The photograph above shows Michael ‘Younes’ Delefortrie outside the main entrance of the courthouse. Sharia4Belgium — a group once credited with being a major source of Belgian jihadists to Syria — disbanded in 2012 when Belkacem was arrested and sentenced to two years for inciting hatred and violence towards non-Muslims. But, according to the court, the organization continued to operate as a recruitment cell into 2013. Old reports of a Sharia showdown in Belgium were recycled in 2015, leading many to believe that Sharia4Belguim was still actively campaigning for Sharia Law there. Blog sites like CrossMap re-reported the three-year old CBN story as breaking news and didn’t include details about the group’s leader being jailed, or the group disbanding. That’s why we’re calling this one “outdated.” ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Some have formed the opinion that SAM’s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer is racist because of comments she made about diversity in an interview with CNN. During the interview, CNN’s Poppy Harlow asked SAM’s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer, who is a black woman, about diversity among company executives. Here’s a transcript of the exchange : Harlow: You are a rarity in the corner office in America. It’s something that so many people want to see changed. Not only are you a female CEO, you are a minority CEO. Where do you fall on who has to make the change and how it’s going to happen so that there are more women like you represented in the top echelons on corporate America. Brewer: I totally agree with you. It starts with the top of many companies. It starts with top leadership. I can tell you that even with myself, I have to live it also. My executive team is very diverse, and I make it a priority. I demand it of my team within the structure, and every now and then you have to nudge your partners. You have to speak up and speak out, and I try to use my platform for that. To remind people. I try to set an example. I’ve mentored many women inside the company and outside the company because I think it’s important. Harlow: And in hiring, do you demand that when you’re hiring for the top spots? Brewer: Absolutely. Not only that, I talk to my suppliers about it. Just today, we met with a supplier and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian male. That was interesting. Harlow: What did you say? Brewer: I decided not to talk about it directly with his folks in the room. But there were actually no females like levels down, so I’m going to place a call to him. Top Right News ran a story on the interview headlined, “Sam’s Club CEO Admits She Discriminates Against White Males… But It’s OK Because She’s Black.” The story was shared more than 10,000 times and many readers sounded off in the comments section. One person commented: She is the dictionary definition of a prejudiced, racist bigot. But she’s a female of color so her prejudiced, bigoted racism is, like, totally OK. Another person on the other side of the argument commented: You’re adorable! I love how you demonize minorities who gain power and then use it like white people! ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Muslims Were Banned from U.S. in 1952-Fiction!","2015-12-11 10:47:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslims-were-banned-from-u-s-in-1952/"," It’s been reported that Islam was banned from entering the U.S. in 1952 when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act. "," Muslims were not banned from the entering the U.S. in 1952. The purpose of the 1952 immigration law was to end the discrimination of immigrants based on “race and creed” — but it’s been widely accepted that the law went about that in a backwards way. That led to much of the law (including the provision in question) being repealed by Congress in 1990 . The 1952 immigration law became a hot topic after GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump released a statement calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” In response to backlash over the statement, Trump’s supporters pointed to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (which became Public Law 414) as “vindication” because the law supposedly banned Muslims from entering the country in 1952. Claims that Congress banned Muslims from entering the U.S. in 1952 can be traced back to Chapter 2 or Public Law 414 . As written, the law bans all aliens “who are members of or affiliated with” organizations that advocate for the overthrow of the U.S. government: (F) Aliens who advocate or teach or who are members of or affiliated with any organization that advocates or teaches (i) the overthrow by force, violence or other unconstitutional means of the Government of the Unites States or of all forms of law; or (ii) the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers (either of specific individuals or of any other organized government, because of his or their official character; or (iii) the unlawful damage, injury, or destruction of property; or (iv) sabotage. It’s true that the law would ban Islamic extremists from groups like ISIS, the Taliban and Al Qaeda who support the overthrow of the U.S. government from the country — but a small minority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims affiliate with extremist groups, according to data from the RAND Corp . That’s one reason we’re classifying claims that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as “false.” We’re calling the claim that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as “false” because it contradicts the original intent of the immigration law. With the bill, Congress ended the “blanket exclusion of immigrants based on race and creed” and established a (controversial) quota system for admitting immigrants from different and ideological grounds for excluding them based on personal history, according to the American Immigration Law Foundation . President Harry S. Truman believed the quota system didn’t go far enough in ending racial barriers, and he opposed ideological tests for immigrants as a violation of the Bill of Rights. He vetoed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Congress later overrode the veto) and wrote that the bill, “Presents a difficult problem of weighing the good against the bad, and arriving at a judgment on the whole.” Truman also wrote: I am asked to approve the reenactment of highly objectionable provisions now contained in the Internal Security Act of 1950–a measure passed over my veto shortly after the invasion of South Korea. Some of these provisions would empower the Attorney General to deport any alien who has engaged or has had a purpose to engage in activities “prejudicial to the public interest” or “subversive to the national security.” No standards or definitions are provided to guide discretion in the exercise of powers so sweeping. To punish undefined “activities” departs from traditional American insistence on established standards of guilt. To punish an undefined “purpose” is thought control. These provisions are worse than the infamous Alien Act of 1798, passed in a time of national fear and distrust of foreigners, which gave the President power to deport any alien deemed “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” Alien residents were thoroughly frightened and citizens much disturbed by that threat to liberty. Such powers are inconsistent with our democratic ideals. Conferring powers like that upon the Attorney General is unfair to him as well as to our alien residents. Once fully informed of such vast discretionary powers vested in the Attorney General, Americans now would and should be just as alarmed as Americans were in 1798 over less drastic powers vested in the President. In conclusion, we’ve classified the claim that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as false for two reasons. First, it assumes that all Muslims belong to or are affiliated with groups that want to overthrow the U.S. government, which is false. Second, that idea contradicts the purpose of the 1952 law to end discrimination of immigrants based on “race and creed.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Mark Zuckerberg Isn’t Really “Giving Away” $45 Billion-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-12-07 10:23:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mark-zuckerberg-isnt-really-giving-away-45-billion/"," Critics argue that Mark Zuckerberg isn’t really “giving away” 99% of his Facebook stock (about $45 billion), as he announced in December 2015. "," After Mark Zuckerberg announced that he plans to “give away” 99% of his Facebook stock, critics argued that Zuckerberg wouldn’t exactly be “giving away” his fortune because of the business model that Zuckerberg plans to use. Claims that Mark Zuckerberg isn’t really giving away $45 billion aren’t true or false. The answer falls somewhere in between because of complicated laws that define limited liability companies (LLCs) and 501c3 organizations (non-profit charities). We’ll lay out the facts and let you decide if claims about Mark Zuckerberg’s plans to “give away” $45 billion are closer to truth or fiction. First, we’ll start from the beginning. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they would donate 99% of their Facebook stock (about $45 billion) to “advancing human potential and promoting equality” in a letter to their newborn daughter on December 1, 2015. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg described the letter as such: Priscilla and I are so happy to welcome our daughter Max into this world! For her birth, we wrote a letter to her about the world we hope she grows up in. It’s a world where our generation can advance human potential and promote equality — by curing disease, personalizing learning, harnessing clean energy, connecting people, building strong communities, reducing poverty, providing equal rights and spreading understanding across nations. We are committed to doing our small part to help create this world for all children. We will give 99% of our Facebook shares — currently about $45 billion — during our lives to join many others in improving this world for the next generation. Thank you to everyone in this community for all your love and support during the pregnancy. You’ve given us hope that together we can build this world for Max and all children. After Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan announced that they would giveaway 99% of their Facebook stock, critics came forward to argue that the couple wasn’t exactly “giving away” their fortune. Because Zuckerberg’s Facebook stock will be meted out through a limited liability company (LLC) instead of a 501c3 (non-profit organization),they argue, Zuckerberg will still be able to use the money to invest in private companies, lobby politicians and donate to political campaigns. He’ll also be able to write checks from the LLC to anybody, including himself. Under the LLC structure, there’s also no board of directors to report to, federal disclosure requirements or minimum charitable contributions that need to be made each year, critics argue. James Kwak, an associate professor at the UConn Law School, called Zuckerberg’s decision to set up an LLC a “$45 billion loophole” in a blog post : Essentially, Zuckerberg can do everything with the LLC’s money that he can do with his own money. So on the most substantive level, he hasn’t done anything except announce some vague intentions. The “99%” claim made a lot of headlines, but there’s a lot less there than meets the eye. A lot of things that other billionaires do with their own money—like invest in other companies—Zuckerberg can now do with the LLC’s money. The only thing he seems to be saying is that he and his family will restrict their personal consumption to 1% of his fortune (about $450 million), but even that is not entirely clear. He certainly retains the ability to take money back out whenever he wants, and the LLC will almost certainly do some things that really are personal consumption (like political contributions). In addition, whenever the LLC makes a contribution to a real charity, the associated tax deduction will flow back up to Zuckerberg and Chan. So to the extent that they have to sell stock to pay for their consumption, they will never pay tax on those sales. (Put another way, their remaining $450 million, as well as any money they make in the future, is now all after-tax money.) Mark Zuckerberg responded to the criticism by explaining the decision to set up an LLC rather than a 501c3 nonprofit. In a follow-up Facebook post , Zuckerberg said that he had decided to forgo the tax advantages of establishing a non-profit organization to support charitable causes because an LLC would give him more flexibility to champion causes. Zuckerberg also said that proceeds from the LLC’s investments in private companies would also be devoted to charitable causes, which is another benefit of an LLC: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is structured as an LLC rather than a traditional foundation. This enables us to pursue our mission by funding non-profit organizations, making private investments and participating in policy debates — in each case with the goal of generating a positive impact in areas of great need. Any net profits from investments will also be used to advance this mission. By using an LLC instead of a traditional foundation, we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively. In fact, if we transferred our shares to a traditional foundation, then we would have received an immediate tax benefit, but by using an LLC we do not. And just like everyone else, we will pay capital gains taxes when our shares are sold by the LLC. What’s most important to us is the flexibility to give to the organizations that will do the best work — regardless of how they’re structured. For example, our education work has been funded through a non-profit organization,Startup:Education, the recently announced Breakthrough Energy Coalitionwill make private investments in clean energy, and we also fund public government efforts, like the CDC Ebola response and San Francisco General Hospital. In the end, there’s no reason to call Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that he’ll give away 99% of his Facebook stocks “false.” But it’s not accurate to say that Zuckerberg has already “given away” $45 billion of his wealth to charitable causes yet, either. That’s why we’re classifying this one as “truth and fiction.” ","9-11 Attack on America"

Summary of eRumor Reports have gone viral that the government is paying people $3,000 a week to smoke marijuana through a federal clinical study. "," The federal government doesn’t pay people $3,000 per week to smoke marijuana as part of a clinical study. That rumor started with the fake new website News Watch 33. In a story that has since been removed from the site, News Watch 33 reported in September 2015 that a clinical study paid participants $3,000 per week to smoke weed. Then, in November 2015, the false report resurfaced when two blog sites rekindled the flame. A website called The Joint Picked up the story on November 25 with a story headlined ,“Federal Study Will Pay You $3,000 Per Week to Consume Cannabis.” According to the report: The United States National Research Center (NRC) has been commissioned by the National Institute of Drug Abuse(NIDA) to conduct comprehensive research evaluating the effects of cannabis on the human body. The research, which will take part in seven facilities across the nation, is intended to determine whether or not cannabis can be used to relieve stress and stress-related disorders, while allowing consumers of the plant to maintain normal function in their lives. “This is one of the first, very promising studies, that will finally reveal the answer of the age old acquisition that stoners are ‘Just Lazy’,” says lead researcher Michael Gregory. “It’s an exciting new study that may push the legality of marijuana to all 50 states.” For the research, participants will be required to stay at the facility for six months (making it immediately un-doable for many if not most people), while performing various everyday activities such as cleaning, watching TV and reading, while also regularly consuming cannabis. During all of this, participants will be evaluated by medical staff. However, The Joint Blog posted an updated in which it said that the NIDA had informed the site that its not conducting the marijuana study and apologized for the confusion. The blog site Green Rush Daily then picked up the report in a story with a report that had been shared more than 6,000 within days. That report hadn’t been retracted or corrected — but it’s also false. Also, it should be noted that Congress voted in July 2015 to block federal studies on medical marijuana.

"Donald Trump: Thousands of American Muslims Celebrated 9/11-Fiction!","2015-11-24 12:10:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-thousands-of-american-muslims-celebrated-911/"," Donald Trump has said that he saw American Muslims in New Jersey celebrating as the World Trade Center fell on 9/11. "," There’s no proof to back up Donald Trump’s claims that he saw thousands of Muslim Americans in New Jersey celebrated as the World Trade Center fell on 9/11. Donald Trump first said that American Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks during a campaign stop in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 21, 2015: During the stump speech, Donald Trump defended his call for surveillance of mosques in the United States by recounting how “thousands and thousands” of American Muslims cheered as the World Trade Center fell on 9/11. Trump’s exact words were: I want surveillance of certain mosques, ok? If that’s ok, I want surveillance. You know what? We’ve had it before and we’ll have it again. Hey, I watched as the World Trade Center came tumbling down. I watched, in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. So, something is going on, we’ve got to find out what it is. I do want surveillance. I will absolutely take database on the poeiple coming from Syrian, if we can’t stop it, but we’re going to. And, if I win, I’ve made it known, they’re going back. We can’t have them. Then, the next day, Donald Trump doubled down on his comments that he saw American Muslims cheering as the World Trade Center fall during an interview with George Stephanopoulos. According to a transcript , Trump said: TRUMP: Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, the police say that didn’t happen and all those rumors have been on the Internet for some time. So did you meek — misspeak yesterday? TRUMP: It did happen. I saw it. STEPHANOPOULOS: You saw that… TRUMP: It was on television. I saw it. STEPHANOPOULOS: — with your own eyes. TRUMP: George, it did happen. STEPHANOPOULOS: Police say it didn’t happen. TRUMP: There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down. I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down — as those buildings came down. And that tells you something. It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don’t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good. STEPHANOPOULOS: As I said, the police have said it didn’t happen. But what I want to move on right now. Then, after the Washington Post called Trump’s claim that thousands of American Muslims celebrated as the World Trade Center fell “outrageous,” Trump tweeted a link to a Washington Post story from 2001 in an attempt to back up his claim: The Washington Post reported on September 18, 2001 , that police in Jersey City “detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgating-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.” It’s important to note that the report didn’t identify those people as Muslim, however. There isn’t any video footage of Muslim Americans celebrating as the World Trade Center fell, and even though the Washington Post article says “a number of people” were detained for allegedly celebrating the attacks, it doesn’t back up Trump’s claim that thousands upon thousands of American Muslims were celebrating as the World Trade Center fell. Serge Kovaleski, the lead reporter on the Washington Post from 2001 that Donald Trump linked to, said he didn’t see large groups of people celebrating: “We did a lot of shoe leather reporting in and around Jersey City and talked to a lot of residents and officials for the broader story. Much of that has, indeed, faded from memory,” said Kovaleski, who’s now an investigative reporter for The New York Times. “But I do not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds, of people celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember.” The former police commissioner of Jersey City also said the claim was false. So, there was at least one report that people in New Jersey were detained for celebrating as the World Trade Center fell, but we’re classifying Donald Trump’s claim that he saw thousands upon thousands of American Muslims celebrate false.

"Wendy’s Uses Horse Meat in Chili and Burgers-Fiction!","2015-11-24 09:53:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/wendys-uses-horse-meat-in-chili-and-burgers/"," The USDA has discovered that Wendy’s uses horse meat in chili and other food. "," Wendy’s doesn’t add horse meat to its chili, or to any other food. That false report started with the fake news website Empire News. Back in November 2014, the website reported that Wendy’s uses horse meat in its burgers, chili and other menu items: “Where’s the Beef?!” was a popular phrase in the 80s, based on the 1984 TV commercial for Wendy’s restaurants featuring little old ladies sampling other restaurant’s menu items. Apparently the answer to the question is, ironically,not at Wendy’s. At a press conference this morning, Wendy Thomas, daughter of founder Dave Thomas, and president of operations Carl Frosty admitted that mounting internet rumors are true, and that Wendy’s stopped using beef in their burgers back in 1984. “It’s true – the 1984 ‘Where’s the Beef’ ad was an inside joke started by my father. I really don’t see the big deal, honestly,” said Thomas. “Horse meat is FDA approved, is has been for ages. If you’ve enjoyed our burgers any time in the last 30 years, there’s no reason not to keep enjoying them. My father was a businessman; he experimented to find the cheapest, yet best tasting meat he could. He tried dog, cat, llama, and rats in our testing labs, but horse meat was the tastiest and the cheapest. It’s even less expensive than beef, if you can believe it.” The story reporting that the 1984 “Where’s the Beef?” ad was a subtle reference to the fact that Wendy’s had started using horse meat in its chili and burgers has been shared thousands of times on social media sites. Many of the people who shared and read the story were tricked into believing that Wendy’s uses horse meat and has since the 1980s, but that’s not the case. The disclaimer for Empire News states that the site is for “entertainment purposes only” so it shouldn’t be considered a trusted news source.","9-11 Attack on America"
"Giant Bear Killed in Alaska by Park Ranger-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-11-20 09:44:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/giant-bear-killed-in-alaska-by-park-ranger/"," Emails show photos of a giant bear that was supposedly killed in Alaska by a park ranger after eating three hikers. "," These photos actually show a giant bear that was killed in Alaska. But, like most good hunting stories, the line between truth and fiction has blurred over time with this one. Photos of a giant bear killed in Alaska first surfaced on a message board in 2004. At the time, it was reported that an airman hunting on Hitchcock Island killed the giant bear. Another version claimed that a park ranger shot the giant bear after it charged him from 50 yards away. After the giant bear was killed, according to urban legend, three hikers were found inside the giant bear’s belly. In both accounts, the bear weighed a monstrous 1,600 pounds. TruthorFiction.com was able to track down the original photos of the giant bear killed in Alaska, and the hunter who shot it. The photos first appeared at the website hunting-pictures.com. A hunter named Jim Urban, who was there when his buddy shot the giant bear, posted them. Jim Urban said that the bear weighed 1,000 to 1,200 pounds — not 1,600 pounds, as has been rumored. And the hunter was not a park ranger, he didn’t shoot the bear as it was charging, and the bear didn’t eat three hikers before it was killed. Those colorful “details” have made stories about the giant bear killed in Alaska into urban legend — but they’re not true. Jim Urban recounted the kill on a blog site called Black Bear Heaven back in 2003. In that account, Urban wrote that he and a hunting buddy, Ted, found the giant bear walking along a riverbed. The giant bear was walking toward them, so they looped around and waiting for it to approach: Murphy’s Law contended our plan, and unwillingly baffled our strategy! Where we stood not seconds earlier, the brush began to part. Ted and I found ourselves going “Mano a Mano” with a bear of a lifetime. The sound of Ted’s heavy breathing was the only thing fading out the dull drum of my now sunken heart. I ran through my mental checklist, “Safety off, round chambered, finger on the trigger and relax.” Now was not the time to make errors. I looked over at Ted who stood between the tree and I. “Are you ready,” I asked. He nodded. My attention focused back on the crosshairs of my riflescope. The gargantuan paw appeared first through the tall shoots, followed by the massive, robust cranium. The boar stepped closer. His head was lobbed low; his rusted muzzle leaked clouds of nasal vapor through quarter size nostrils; and those beady, bloodshot eyes stared through my partner and I. The solemn look alone was enough to make one feel threatened, but oddly the bear showed no sign of aggression. Each step closer the bear inched, I felt more compelled to renege on my agreement with Ted, and kill the bear myself. “Pull the trigger!” I demanded Ted, “Pull the trigger!” The blast of Ted’s .338 Win-Mag rang out and sent a direct hit to the bear’s nerve center bringing him to his hindquarters. Two shots to the vitals followed, completely dropping the bear, while a series of three additional rounds provided enough insurance to tame our own racing anxieties. The boar dropped in his tracks. What played through my head in slow motion seemed endless, but in reality was over in a fraction of seconds. So, photos of the giant grizzly bear that was killed in a Alaska that have been circulating for more than a decade are real, but stories surrounding them are false. In case your wondering, a hunter in Alaska shot the second biggest grizzly bear ever recorded in 2014. It measured nine feet tall, and its skull measured nearly 28 inches. There was no word on how much he weighed, according to Fox News .","9-11 Attack on America"

"," It’s true that Dr. Ben Carson has a portrait of him and Jesus hanging in his home. A photo of the Ben Carson-Jesus portrait was captured by a Guardian photographer who shot the inside of Ben Carson’s home in Maryland in 2014. The painting shows Ben Carson seated next to Jesus, who has his arm draped over Carson’s shoulder: The photo went viral on November 7, 2015, when the Guardian posted a photo gallery from the 2014 photo shoot on its website. Other photos show awards, degrees and honors hanging on the walls of Ben Carson’s home. The portrait of Ben Carson and Jesus isn’t new, either. The earliest reference to the portrait came in a 2009 Baltimore magazine profile of Ben Carson : Their strong faith is also a guiding force. “We are very spiritual people so you will see a lot of Bibles around the house and things that are indicative of that,” says Carson, who attends a Seventh Day Adventist Church in Silver Spring. “I don’t have to be politically correct here.” He points to a stained-glass window in his foyer, a painting of him with Jesus, and his favorite proverb over the fireplace—”By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life”—Proverbs 22:4. Photos and reports of the Ben Carson-Jesus portrait didn’t draw any attention before Carson became the Republican frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election in 2016 — but the portrait is definitely real.

We reached out to Spirit Airlines for comment on the rumor that it does not “cater to the military” and charges service members to carry their uniforms onto flights, and future updates will be posted here. The rumor surfaced when a man who identified himself as the father of a service member posted a comment to the “Spirit Airlines Sucks” Facebook page in October 2015 that reads: On 10/16/2015 my son came home from leave from the United States Army, he flew in on American Airlines, he tried to save by flying back on Spirit Airlines ( what a mistake ) when he was going back on 10/19/2015 the ticket agent in Detroit Metro Airport asked him what was in his garment bag he was carrying he replied my army dress blues uniform. The ticket agent informed him he would have to pay 55 dollars to bring it on board. I stepped in and said you are going to charge this kid in the army 55 dollars to bring his army uniform on the plane? HER EXACT WORDS WERE WE DO NOT CATER TO THE MILITARY. My son replied when i fly in on American or Delta they do not charge me, in fact they ask me if they can hang it up for me and tell me thanks for your service and flying with us. I have called Spirit and trying talking with them it’s like talking to a wall. I am fighting this as far as i can go, they have lost fares from everyone in my family and i am sure when this gets out they will lose a lot more from the military that travel their airlines. I hope people reading this will please share it on their face book pages… We’ve confirmed that most of what that Facebook post says about Spirit Airlines is true, but we can’t confirm the specific claim that this man’s service member son was charged $55 to carry his uniform onto a Spirit Airlines flight. Spirit Airlines is an economy airline that goes by the philosophy that “we believe in paying for what you use, not what you don’t.” The airline offers a “Bare Fare” ticket that allows travelers to get from point A to B at an “ultra-low” rate with one carry on item about the size of a backpack. There’s a $50 fee for travelers who purchase an additional carry-on item in advance, and a $55 fee for travelers who purchase an additional carry-on item at the gate, on the day of travel, according to Spirit Airlines . So, it’s true that Spirit Airlines charges $55 for an additional carry-on item when the airline isn’t’ notified in advance, and $50 when it is. It’s also true that Spirit Airlines does not offer military discounts for service members. Spirit Airlines explains , “Our fares are already very low, and we are unable to offer additional discounts.” Spirit Airlines has drawn scrutiny in the past for refusing to offer military discounts to service members. Other airlines offer discounts on rates, free additional carry-on bags and complimentary wheel chair service for disabled service members, Fox News reports . Spirit Airlines CEO Ben Baldanza has said that the airline offers an “al a cart” model of air fare to help educate customers about hidden costs that are included in other airline tickets — and to provide the cheapest option possible: That’s where the term Bare Fare came up. We want to try to be more obvious to people that our fare is kind of a stripped-down naked fare. The idea of Bare Fare, simple as it sounds, should just in and of itself tell you that there’s something a little bit different about this than just a normal fare, and get people to understand a little better. That’s just one small aspect of a broader initiative at Spirit in the way we talk to our customers on the website, the way we organize our airports, the language our reservations agents use, the way our airplanes look, the way we message to the media–all kinds of things. It’s all around a clearer understanding and more transparency around the true value proposition that Spirit offers, which is that we get you where you’re going for a lower price point, although they have to expect some compromise for that. Oftentimes when travelers find out that perks that are included in other airline fares (like discounts for service members) are not included in Spirit Airlines ticket prices, they are often upset and file complaints. So, the basic idea of Spirit Airlines is that when you buy the cheapest airline ticket possible — you get what you pay for. We’ve reached out to Spirit Airlines for comment on this rumor. Future updates will be posted here. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"NASA: November Blackout Confirmed, 15 Days of Darkness Ahead-Fiction!","2015-11-05 10:49:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nasa-november-blackout-confirmed-15-days-of-darkness-ahead/"," NASA has confirmed that a November blackout will occur when a “close parallelism” causes Venus to shine brighter than Jupiter, causing 15 days of darkness on Earth. "," Rumors that NASA has confirmed a November blackout or 15 days of darkness are false. The rumors started when a fake news website called News Watch 33 reported in July that NASA had confirmed a “once-in-a-million” November blackout would be caused by an usual alignment of Venus and Jupiter: Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2015 at 3 a.m. and will end on Monday, November 30, 2015 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the “November Black Out” event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter. This rumor can easily be debunked because it was started by a fake news website — but many YouTube videos and follow-up reports advance conspiracy theories that claim NASA has confirmed the November blackout, just not on its website. NASA hasn’t confirmed the November blackout on its website for a good reason: it’s not going to happen. The same exact claim was made back in December 2012 (when the Mayan calendar supposedly predicted end times), and Dr. John Carlson, the director of the Center for Archaeocastronomy at NASA, said the November blackout theory doesn’t hold any water: “Absolutely not. Neither NASA nor any other scientific organization is predicting such a blackout. The false reports on this issue claim that some sort of “alignment of the Universe” will cause a blackout. There is no such alignment. Some versions of this rumor cite an emergency preparedness message from NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. This is simply a message encouraging people to be prepared for emergencies, recorded as part of a wider government preparedness campaign. It never mentions a blackout. When asked if the planets could align in a way that would cause 15 days of darkness, or a November blackout, Carlson responded: There are no planetary alignments in the next few decades and even if these alignments were to occur, their effects on the Earth would be negligible. One major alignment occurred in 1962, for example, and two others happened during 1982 and 2000. Each December the Earth and sun align with the approximate center of the Milky Way Galaxy but that is an annual event of no consequence. So, the NASA November blackout rumor is a hoax, and it’s probably not the last one. Just remember that when rumors about 15 days of darkness or November blackouts coming to earth, science has proven them wrong time after time. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"Cracker Barrel Being Forced to Change its Name to “Caucasian Barrel”-Fiction!","2015-08-24 10:44:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cracker-barrel-being-forced-to-change-name-to-caucasian-barrel/"," An online petition is forcing Cracker Barrel to change its name to “Caucasian Barrel” in the spirit of political correctness. "," An online petition was launched to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but it’s a satirical petition. A Des Moines man named Ryan Koch launched the “Change the Name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel” petition on Change.org in July 2015. The petition, which had been signed by about 15,000 supporters, said: I say all of us European Americans start protesting C****er Barrel. It uses an offensive slur and it is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage. The name is offensive, their logo stereotypes European Americans as people who sit on chairs and lean against what appears to be a bourbon barrel, claiming we are all a bunch of alcoholics. Sure, they’ll SAY it’s a “cracker” barrel but everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels, they come in bags and boxes! Change the name C****er Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. After all, white people should have something to be offended by, too! The Cracker Barrel name change petition isn’t clearly labeled as satire, which tricked some people into believing that there was a genuine effort underway to rebrand the restaurant chain as “Caucasian Barrel.” But Ryan Koch told an ABC affiliate that the petition “is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes” and “to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America.” For its part, Cracker Barrel acknowledged the “satirical petition” and said “individuals have the right to express their opinion all types of things”: At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service. So, while it’s true that a satirical petition was launched to change the name of Cracker Barrel, the story mislead many into believing that it was a serious effort. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," We’ve confirmed that this commentary is by Wayne Allyn Root. The commentary, titled “Why Obama and Hillary Must Stop Donald Trump at All Costs,” first appeared on the website Personal Liberty on July 9, 2015. A written version of the commentary then appeared on Wayne Allyn Root’s personal website, Root for America , about two weeks later. Wayne Allyn Root’s commentary on Donald Trump’s presidential bid has been viewed more than a half million times, and it’s been shared more than 100,000 times on social media sites. The commentary has also been widely circulated in mass emails. Root theorizes that Trump wouldn’t be owned big-money donors because he’s a self-supported billionaire. That would be disastrous for Obama and Hillary Clinton, Root said, because Trump wouldn’t be part of the “old boys club” that runs politics: These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there’s one man — and only one man — who isn’t beholden to anyone. There’s one man who doesn’t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teachers union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the bar association to fund his campaign. Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn’t need anyone’s help. That means he doesn’t care what the media says. He doesn’t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters. Root’s commentaries have focused almost entirely on Donald Trump since he entered the presidential race in June 2015. ","9-11 Attack on America"

Timothy White doesn’t face discipline or criminal charges for opening fire at Mohammod Abulazeez, the man who killed five Marines in Chattanooga. The Navy’s investigation into Abulazeez’s shooting is ongoing, but Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White didn’t face discipline for carrying a personal weapon at a military facility when the rumor went viral, according to a statement from the Navy: “Stories of Navy personnel being charges with an offense are not true. There is still a long way to go in reviewing the facts of this tragic incident, but at this time we can confirm no service member has been charged with an offense.” Shortly after the shootings in Chattanooga, reports surfaced that  Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White and a slain Marine had opened fire on Abulzeez with personal sidearms, Navy Times reports : A Navy officer and a Marine fired their sidearms hoping to kill or subdue the gunman who murdered five service members last week in Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to multiple military officials familiar with internal reporting on the tragedy. It remains unclear whether either hit Muhammad Abdulazeez, who was shot and killed on July 16 after he gunned down four Marines and a sailor at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga. It’s also unclear why they were armed, as it is against Defense Department policy for anyone other than military police or law enforcement to carry weapons on federal property. A report distributed among senior Navy leaders during the shooting’s aftermath said Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White, the support center’s commanding officer, used his personal firearm to engage Abdulazeez, Navy Times confirmed with four separate sources. A Navy official also confirmed a Washington Post report indicating one of the slain Marines may have been carrying a 9mm Glock and possibly returned fire on the gunman. Rumors that Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White could face military discipline or criminal charges for carrying an unauthorized weapon quickly lit up the blogosphere. The blog site Western Journalism first reported that White “may be punished” for carrying a personal weapon at a military facility. The report didn’t make specific claims about charges against White. Rather, it implied that White could technically face discipline. Then, Alan B. West reported that he had received confirmation that Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White would in fact face charges: Ladies and gents, resulting from the text message I received yesterday, I can confirm that the United States Navy is bringing charges against Lt. Cmdr Timothy White for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property. West didn’t cite his source, or explain what charges White would face. The Navy quickly shot down the report with its statement that said there was a “long way to go” in its investigation of the shooting. Investigation into the shooting is ongoing.

"ABC News Bans Flag Lapel Pins – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-04-20 01:58:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abcflag/"," ABC News executives told reporters not to wear American flag lapel pins because the network should remain as neutral as possible. "," Rumors that ABC News has banned American flag lapel pins have been swirling ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim was based in truth at one time, but it has drifted more toward fiction over the years. The 9/11 attacks resulted in a wave of patriotism that had not been seen in decades. The shared enthusiasm for the country and flag were widespread. It created difficulties for reporters, however, who try to professionally earn and keep people’s trust by avoiding personal partisan displays while reporting in the news. Many media outlets struggled to preserve their image as journalists while at the same time appearing unpatriotic in a time of crisis. Some journalists elected to wear American flag lapel pins on air, and the debate started. CBS, NBC and CNN did not have a lapel pin policy in place before or after 9/11, the Orlando Sentinel reports . Reporters for those stations regularly wore American flag lapel pins on air while covering 9/11. When word got out that ABC News had “banned American flag lapel pins,” the network became a lightning rod for criticism. However, the eRumor began to drift away from the truth almost immediately. The network never specifically singled out American flag lapel pins — it prohibited its reporters from wearing any lapel pin on the air. David Westin, the former president of ABC News, said in a 2012 interview with CNN that he made the decision to stick with the no-lapel pin policy in the days that followed 9/11: “It came up while I was in the control room. As you’ll recall, we were on the air for about four and a half days straight — 24 hours, seven days a week with no commercial interruption or anything else. There was constant reporting coming in during that time and we were having to make decisions about what to do and what not to do … They came to us and said, ‘We are being asked why we’re not wearing lapel pins,’ because a number of other outlets, particularly cable news, were. Fox News in particular had integrated the American flag into the backdrop and bumpers and teases and everything else. And we’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort. The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly, ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision.” Ever since, the stance that ABC News takes on all lapel pins — including American flag lapel pins — has been widely misunderstood. Under the policy, reporters are simply asked not to wear lapel pins. What happens if they do anyway? Not much, apparently. Terry Moran, who covered the Bush administration for ABC News in 2001, chose to defy the network and wore a flag lapel pin . He still climbed the network’s ranks over the next decade and became co-anchor of the show “Nightline.” This eRumor has resurfaced a number of times over the years. After President Obama temporarily stopped wearing an American flag lapel pin in 2007, ABC News was accused of “following the president’s lead” in a series of viral emails. Considering the long standing lapel pin policy at ABC News, that claim is false. Then, in early 2015, another viral email claimed that ABC News had just ordered reporters not to wear “lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia.” That email was outdated and stretched the truth about the policy to begin with.

When light shines through translucent fabric, there is frequently a distribution of the light along the pattern of the weave of the fabric.  This particular picture appears to have been taken when the sun was toward the upper portion of the blue section of the flag so the upper portion of the vertical line is shorter than the lower portion, resulting in a traditional looking cross.  If the sun had been in the middle of the blue portion of the flag, the lines would have been more equal in each direction.

They are designed to transport and land troops, supplies, and equipment such as amphibious vehicles and helicopters. Designated as LPD. It is one of three similar ships that are being built and being given names that are associated with The Attack on America.  In addition to the USS New York, the USS Arlington will be named because of the location of the Pentagon, which was hit by American Airlines flight 77.  The USS Somerset will be named after the county in Pennsylvania in which United flight 93 crashed after being taken over by hijackers. The ship is being built in New Orleans.  Twenty-four tons of steel from the World Trade Center have been recycled for the project.  About seven tons were melted down and poured into a cast to make the bow section of the ship’s hull.  The steel has been treated with reverence by the ship builders and several workers have postponed retirements for the honor of working on the USS New York. According to Naval records, several other ships have carried the name the USS New York. This new ship got the name the USS New York when New York governor George Pataki wrote to Secretary of the Navy Gordon England and requested that the Navy approve of the name in honor of the victims of September 11 and on ships that will be used to fight the war on terror.

"," This is a hoax…but has generated more mail to TruthOrFiction.com than any of the eRumors resulting from the terrorist attacks. Update! According to an article on Wired.com , the face in the picture of “The Last Picture” is a Hungarian named Peter who has declined to reveal his last name, but provided other pictures of himself from the same day on top of the World Trade Center to authenticate his claim.  He said he created the version with the jetliner using Photoshop and emailed it to a few of his friends as a joke.  It took off from there.  A young man in Brazil has previously claimed to be Tourist Guy and has gotten quite a bit of visibility as a result including an advertising contract with a major car manufacturer.  Some of Peter’s friends thought the record should be put straight and revealed his identity on a Hungarian news site . It’s kind of become a form of recreation to figure out all that is wrong with the picture. Several things to say about it, including some comments from our readers: 1. The most significant is that of the two towers of the World Trade Center, only one of them had an outside observation deck, tower #2, also called the south tower. 2. The south tower was struck by a United Airlines plane, not an American airlines plane.  The aircraft in this picture is an American jet. 3.  We’ve discovered what we think may be the source of the picture of the airliner in this photo.  It is from Airliners.net. CLICK HERE to see the a thumbnail of the picture. CLICK HERE to see a larger version of the picture. Photo by Jonathon Derden Our thanks to Airliners.net 4.  The picture of the aircraft in this photo is a Boeing 757.  The actual American Airlines plane that was hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center was a Boeing 767. 5. If such a thing as a camera with film had survived the collapse of the building and there were a picture of an airliner moments before impact, do you think the only way you would hear about it would be through a forwarded email?  Such a picture would be astonishing and showcased by media world-wide. 6.  We’ve had several emails from readers commenting that the date on the picture appears to be wrong.  The date doesn’t show up well in our reduced version of the picture, but the original does have “09-11-01” on it.  Here it is enlarged.  Some of the pixelization in and around the date is thought by many to be evidence that it was pasted into the picture. 7.  Numerous readers have pointed out that it was a nice September day on the eleventh and the person in this picture appears to be braced for the cold. 8.  TruthOrFiction.com reader James O. looked up the weather for that day from Accuweather.  The temperature was headed for a high of 81 degrees. 9.  Several readers pointed out that the angle of the shadows on the tower doesn’t seem to be evident on the airplane. 10.  James O. also pointed out that neither of the jetliners was in level flight when hitting the towers.  They both struck while in a banking turn. 11.  Reader Walter H. notes that the airplane seems to be too high compared with where the American jet hit the building. 12.  According to the former website topoftheworld.citysearch.com, the observation deck did not open to tourists until 9:30a.  The airliner attacks took place prior to that 13.  Many have written that if this picture had actually been taken at the World Trade Center, there would not be such a short railing.  Most high buildings have restraints to keep people from falling or jumping off.  On WTC 2 however, the observation deck did not go to the edge of the building.  If anyone went over the railing, they would fall to another deck below. 14.  Many have written to say that this picture appears to have come from a low-quality camera that would not have been likely to catch an airliner that is traveling at 300+ miles per hour without blurring.  We haven’t looked into that. 15.  Other emails ask whether both the tourist and whoever took the picture wouldn’t hear the jetliner approaching. update:9/14/12","9-11 Attack on America"

"Focus on Internet petitions","2015-03-17 22:38:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/petitions/"," One of the new trends on       the Internet is petitions.  Some ask you to add your name to       the bottom of an email and send it to your friends.  Others ask       you to go to a website to register your opinion.  Are these       valid?  Do they work? "," The effectiveness of these petitions depends on a number of factors, but there are problems with both methods. EMAIL PETITIONS The email versions  are usually forwarded from person to person and have a long list of names or email addresses at the bottom.  The recipient of the email is asked to add his or her name and forward it to others. The main problem with many of these email petitions is that a surprising number of them do not seem to have a final destination.  In other words, they keep circulating from person to person, but there’s no information about who is going to give the names to the government agency, politician, celebrity or whoever is supposed to receive them. Other email petitions do have instructions, usually to forward the latest version to the originator’s email address when a certain number of names have been accumulated..  Others ask that when the goal of names has been reached, the email be forwarded directly to the White House or wherever. If you want to add your name to one of these Internet petitions, that’s your privilege but we have to tell you that in our experience, none of them has accomplished its purpose. The biggest problem with email petitions is that they do not really carry the weight that people normally associate with petitions.  Typical paper petitions are valid because real people have signed them with real signatures and, presumably, real addresses.  When petitions are circulated to qualify a political candidate for public office or an initiative is launched to change a law, the petitions are accepted only if a minimum number of the signers can later be  validated by comparing name and address information with known records such as voter registration data.  The names on an email petition, however, can be easily fabricated.  There is no way of knowing whether the alleged “signers” really attached their names or if someone simply created or borrowed a list of names and pasted them into the email.  As a result, an email with a lot of names on it does not really say much of significance. ONLINE PETITIONS The online petitions that ask you to register your name at a website potentially carry more clout because they ask for names and addresses, although there is still the lack of a signature (unless electronic signatures become popular for petitions).  That leaves open the question of whether the names and addresses have been fabricated or borrowed. The biggest question with regard to online petitions, however, is who is sponsoring them and why?  This is where it gets a little slippery. One of the largest online petition websites does not list the names of any of the people running it, has no information about the organization or organizations associated with it, if any, and gives no evidence that the petitions they sponsor have been presented to politicians..  Yet hundreds of thousands of people have given this website their personal information including addresses, business information, and email addresses. If the website was not committed to the petition campaigns, why would it exist? The answer is:  mailing lists. Those hundreds of thousands of names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses are a gold mine for marketers who use the lists to send various kinds of solicitations and they can make a fortune renting or selling the names to other businesses.  The online petition sites have been a sensational source of not only new names for mailing lists but names of people who can be identified as having particular interests such as supporting conservative or liberal causes, environmental issues, animals rights, etc. There is nothing wrong with businesses and other organizations accumulating mailing lists and there is nothing wrong with any of us ending up on one…as long as we know and give approval for it. If you are tempted to sign an online petition, make sure the sponsoring site either discloses, or responds to your questions about, several things: 1.  Who owns, sponsors, or runs the site either individually or organizationally?  Don’t accept vague descriptions such as, “Our site has been organized by people who believe in protecting the environment.”   What are the names of the individuals or groups involved? 2.  Can they attest that their petitions have been presented to people or organizations where the petitions would do any good? Will they give specifics so you could check out their claims? 3.  Will they honor your request to not be included in any mailing list.  All you want to do is sign the petition and be on your way.

The website asks several questions, which we will deal with in order. 1.  “The Associated Press first reported that a booby trapped truck had caused the explosion.” If this AP report was made, TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find it and none of the sites that makes reference to it lists a source.  Conflicting reports are common during breaking stories and if someone did speculate a truck bomb, that theory quickly disappeared. 2.  “Can you explain how a Boeing 757- 200, weighing nearly 100 tons and travelling at a minimum speed of 250 miles an hour only damaged the outside of the Pentagon? ” First, the Pentagon suffered extensive damage to more than just the outside. CLICK HERE TO SEE CHART Also, the portion of the Pentagon where the plane hit was probably the most heavily reinforced.  In the October 3, 2001 edition of Architecture Week, B.J. Novitski wrote that the impact of the plane was in “Wedge One,” which had been strengthened by recent renovation, a project that was inspired, in part, by the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He says that contrary to what is believed, the casualties among workers in the Pentagon were not low because of vacant offices, but because of the extraordinary structural strength of the building.  Novitski says that about 80 percent of the workers in the wedge were on duty that day, but …”the exterior walls had been reinforced with steel beams and columns, bolted where they met at each floor. Some of these reinforced walls very near the point of impact remained in place for a half hour before collapsing, allowing uncounted hundreds to escape.”  The hijackers chose one of the most reinforced buildings in the world to crash into. 3.  ‘Can you explain how a Boeing 14.9 yards high, 51.7 yards long, with a wingspan of 41.6 yards and a cockpit 3.8 yards high, could crash into just the ground floor of this building?’ Eyewitnesses to the crash as well as video from a security camera at the Pentagon show that the plane struck at ground level.  Considering the description of the strength of the building (above), it is not surprising that the weaker appendages of the plane such as the tail and the wings would not have had as much of an impact as the main body. 4.  “Can you explain why the Defence [sic] Secretary deemed it necessary to sand over the lawn, which was otherwise undamaged after the attack?” According to the article in Architecture Week, it was for a gravel bed that provided a road for large trucks to have access to the crash site. 5.  “Can you explain what happened to the wings of the aircraft and why they caused no damage?” Same answer as in #3.  Photographs show indentations where the stronger, inner portions of the wings may have made impact, but the farther out towards the tips of the wings and the tail, the less they would have had effect. 6.  “Can you find the aircraft’s point of impact? We’re not sure what this question is supposed to mean.  There are plenty of pictures that show clearly where the airplane hit the building.  For some reason, the creators of the website chose two of the pictures that don’t show it clearly.  Dick Bridges, the deputy manager for Arlington County was quoted by AP on September 14, 2001, as saying that both of the “black boxes” for flight #77 were found “…right where the plane came into the building.”  If the recorders didn’t get much beyond that, the plane not only struck the building at that point, but the ground as well.  The cockpit voice recorder was so badly damaged that it didn’t yield any information. Other considerations… 1.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77 that hit the Pentagon, then where is the airplane and the 64 people who were aboard? None of the conspiracy sites answers that question.  Few of them even ask it. 2.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77, then why do they have evidence of the bodies of known crew, passengers, and hijackers? C. Christopher Kelley of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology says that the effort to identify bodies that ended on November 16, 2001, identified all but one of the victims of flight 77. 3.  In response to the question of “Where is the Boeing,” the answer is “in pieces.” There was plenty of evidence of the airplane at the site including debris from the plane, as mentioned above, the remains of the passengers, and the cockpit data and voice recorders.  Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reported on September 13,2001,  that members of congress who had visited the Pentagon crash site were told by rescue officials that much of the fuselage of the Boeing 757 remained intact inside the damaged Pentagon. 4.  Radar tracked the plane toward the Pentagon. Much has been made on some of the conspiracy sites that the transponder in the cockpit was turned off by the hijackers so it isn’t clear what happened to the plane after that.  The founder of TruthOrFiction.com, Rich Buhler, is a licensed commercial pilot and says the transponder being turned off doesn’t mean the plane can no longer be seen on radar.  The transponder is a device that not only makes the airplane more visible on a radar screen, but also gives the radar controller other information such as the altitude, speed, and sometimes the identity of the airliner.  If the transponder is turned off, radar controllers can usually still see what is called the “primary target.”  That means there is a blip on the radar screen showing the location.  According to www.airdisaster.com , flight 77’s transponder was turned off shortly after departure from Dulles airport near Washington DC, but radar controllers could see the primary target flying directly toward the White House.  Then the plane was seen to veer away from the White House and head for the Pentagon.","9-11 Attack on America"
"Air Force General Richard Hawley’s comments on the Attack on America-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hawley/"," A series of strongly worded observations about reactions to the Attack on America from a U.S. Air Force General, Richard Hawley. "," General Richard Hawley is now retired, but was most recently the commander of the Air Combat Command, headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.  He is a decorated pilot who flew more than 400 combat missions in Vietnam. TruthOrFiction.com contacted General Hawley and he says he did not write this eRumor that bears his name. He did, however, send us his own comments about the issues that the eRumor addresses: From the real General Richard Hawley: 1) Goodness, Evil and Relativity: There are some really good people in this world. They volunteer to help those who need it, and ask nothing in return. There are also some really bad people in this world. They exploit those who need help, or who have less wit or “charisma”, and motivate them to join in committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against people they don’t even know. Then there are the rest of us. Average people who try each day to do no harm, to provide for their families, to do an occasional act of kindness. The evil that was perpetrated against our land on 9/11 was the product of Mullahs who see our prosperity and power as a threat to their control over the uneducated Muslim masses on whose shoulders they ride through life. And so they preach hate. They are evil. 2) Violence begets violence: It’s true. Violence does beget violence. But sometimes there is no alternative but to confront those who would perpetrate evil acts against us. This is one of those times. We are blessed to have courageous men and women willing to put their lives on the line to track down and annihilate those who have been so imbued with evil as to be beyond redemption. But violence is not a strategy. It is a necessary and fully justified reaction to an unimaginable threat. But it is not a strategy. If we are to win this war, we must defeat the Mullahs. And to defeat the Mullahs, we must find ways to separate them from their uneducated flocks. We cannot kill all those who have been taught to hate us, nor should we wish to. Far better to change their minds than to change their state of being. 3) The intelligence community let us down: Well, maybe just a little. Lots of senior and not so senior intelligence people became just as enamored of high tech gadgets as their political masters. The protests over our evisceration of the human intelligence component of the agency were not very loud or forceful. Keeping spies on the ground is a high risk and often dirty business, and it wasn’t just liberal politicians who didn’t have much stomach for it. 4) Poverty is the breeding ground for terrorists: No, it isn’t; but religious extremism is. The Mullahs fear our wealth and power because it shows that a secular society with democratic institutions and a free market economy can do a better job of taking care of its peoples’ needs, both spiritual and physical, than the oppressive Islamic regimes that they aspire to lead. The Mullahs are the problem, not poverty, but poverty does make it easier for the Mullahs to spread their evil – as do governments that tolerate and even reinforce their hateful message. 5) Profiling: We are at war here! We are not talking about traffic stops. If we were at war with Iceland, I would expect those charged with our defense to pay very close attention to any Icelander who ventured near our shores. In this war I expect them to pay very close attention to Muslims with ties to the places that spew hatred against us. Random checks when there are no such obvious targets available are a good way to keep the evil ones guessing, but let’s not make small children and grandmothers take their shoes off while we watch far more likely candidates walk aboard unchecked. 6) Resolutions: a. Never forget that what happened on September the 11th of 2001 was an act of war. b. Never sit silently by while someone tries to justify what happened on that day as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East or elsewhere. c. Fly our nation’s flag proudly – it represents this world’s greatest hope to move beyond the pain and suffering that inflict so many across the globe. Richard E.

"Canadian Gordon Sinclair’s commentary on America-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gordonsinclair/"," This is a heart-warming and encouraging email that quotes what it says is a Canadian television broadcast by Gordon Sinclair.  It is a tribute to America. "," The commentary by Gordon Sinclair is true, although people along the way have altered portions of it. Originally written for a Toronto newspaper, it was broadcast on June 5, 1973 on CFRB radio in Toronto, Canada. It had a big impact at the time. A recording of Sinclair reading his commentary became a best-selling record that hit Canada’s top 30.  Canadian broadcaster Byron MacGregor produced a version in his own voice.  It was called “Americans” and became a hit record as well, rising to Canada’s top 5, selling 3.5 million copies.  That meant 3 gold records for MacGregor.  He donated the proceeds to the American Red Cross. Both the eRumor and the text from the original broadcast are below. Original script of Gordon Sinclair’s commentary: “The Americans” The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the earth. As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtse. Who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did. They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries into help… Managua Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped. The Marshall Plan .. the Truman Policy .. all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war-mongering Americans. I’d like to see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. Come on… let’s hear it! Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar or the Douglas 107? If so, why don’t they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or women on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times … and safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them … unless they are breaking Canadian laws..are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here. When the Americans get out of this bind … as they will… who could blame them if they said ‘the hell with the rest of the world’. Let someone else buy the Israel bonds, Let someone else build or repair foreign dams or design foreign buildings that won’t shake apart in earthquakes. When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke. I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don’t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our neighbours have faced it alone and I am one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians. And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th Annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. This year’s disasters .. with the year less than half-over… has taken it all and nobody…but nobody… has helped. ORIGINAL SCRIPT AND AUDIO COURTESY STANDARD BROADCASTING CORPORATION LTD.

"Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, views on September 11-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/falwell-robertson-wtc/"," There are several different versions of the eRumor.  Some say that in an Interview on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club telecast, Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell seemed to be resting the blame for the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on 9/11/01 on their political and moral enemies rather than the terrorists themselves.  Others simply repeat their remarks that gays, abortionists, the ACLU, and the People For the American Way should share in the blame for a spiritual vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place. "," According to the CBN website, the Interview took place on Thursday, September 13 (Some versions of the eRumor say it was Wednesday). Both men spoke harshly of the terrorists and clearly blamed them for the attacks. During a discussion about whether this crisis might bring revival to America, Jerry Falwell said God may have allowed what the nation deserved because of moral decay and said Americans should have an attitude of repentance before God and asking for God’s protection.  He specifically listed the ACLU, abortionists, feminists, gays, and the People For the American way as sharing in the blame.  Pat Robertson responded with agreement. APOLOGY The was national publicity over the Robertson-Falwell interview and strong reaction from representatives of some of the groups that Falwell named. On 9/14/01, Falwell issued an apology for his comments and said he believes that the terrorists alone were responsible for the attacks.  He reiterated, however, that theologically he believes that groups that have worked to secularize America have helped remove the nation from its spiritual foundations. Pat Robertson, on his website, distanced himself from the comments that he had agreed with at the time they were made.  He said that during the interview, Falwell suddenly made a “…political statement of blame directed at certain segments of the population that was severe and harsh in tone, and, frankly, not fully understood by the three hosts of The 700 Club who were watching Rev. Falwell on a monitor.”  Robertson said he considered the comments “totally inappropriate” and that critics had taken the words out of context. THE TRANSCRIPT Here are their comments in context: Pat Robertson began the interview asking Falwell what his response has been to the terrorist attacks.  Falwell said there had been a massive prayer gathering of members of his congregation along with students from Liberty University.  He told the TV audience that they had humbled themselves before God, prayed for President Bush and his advisers and for the victims of the attacks. Falwell then likened the attacks to Pearl Harbor and that at that time, Hitler wanted to destroy the Jews and conquer the world.  Now, “Islamic fundamentalists, radical terrorists, Middle-Eastern monsters” want to destroy Israel and conquer the world. The two men then talked about religious revival and whether the events of September 11 might spark spiritual renewal in America. Then Falwell said, “What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.” Robertson replied,  “Well, Jerry, that’s my feeling. I think we’ve just seen the antechamber to terror, we haven’t begun to see what they can do to the major population.” Falwell said, “The ACLU has got to take a lot of blame for this. And I know I’ll hear from them for this, but throwing God…successfully with the help of the federal court system…throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools, the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad…I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who try to secularize America…I point the finger in their face and say you helped this happen.” Robertson said, “I totally concur, and the problem is we’ve adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government, and so we’re responsible as a free society for what the top people do, and the top people, of course, is the court system.” Falwell added, “Pat, did you notice yesterday that the ACLU and all the Christ-haters, the People for the American Way, NOW, etc., were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress, as they went out on the steps and and called out to God in prayer and sang ‘God bless America’ and said, let the ACLU be hanged. In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time, calling on God.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Airline pilot who asked his passengers to take action if hijacked-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:01:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/airposse/"," A passenger writes an account of her experience aboard an airliner shortly after the terrorist hijackings of September 11.  She says the pilot gave a pep-talk before take-off that included his instruction that the passengers should overpower any hijackers that might try to take over the flight.  Among other things, he allegedly told them to throw things at the hijackers and try to get blankets over their heads so they couldn’t see. "," This has been an odd one to track down, but here’s what we’ve got: The Internet eRumor version of the story merely mentions a female business traveler flying from Denver to Washington, D.C. There is a commentary in the Washington Times on September 21, 2001 written by Paul Hannaford who is described as a public affairs consultant.  He doesn’t say whether he was on the flight but he does give details of what transpired. There is also an Associated Press story from September 21, 2001 written by Sharon Cohen that says there was a passenger aboard the flight named Kathy Rockel who experienced it all first-hand.  She is a medical transcriptionist who was traveling on the flight on September 15, the Saturday after the terrorist attacks.  She says it was United flight 564 from Denver to Dulles airport. TruthOrFiction.com has tried twice to get comment from United Airlines and they have declined. The first time was an outright “We have no comment.”  The second was “We’re trying to deal with the needs of families who experienced loss on September 11, and we don’t have the time to look into stuff like this.”  In other words, they don’t want to talk about it.

"," Lynne Palmer is a Las Vegas Astrologer who bills herself as “adviser to Hollywood stars and Wall Street Financiers.” In her self-published book “Lynne Palmer’s 2001 Almanac,” Palmer lists September 11-13 as among the dates to “avoid terrorist attacks.” TruthOrFiction.com spoke with Lynne Palmer who said that she also chose those dates as ones associated with fire and explosions. Many of the emails we’ve received are from people who are under the impression that she pinpointed the days of the terrorist attack and “predicted” it. TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed some of her book however, and it’s not as precise as that. To be fair to Palmer, she has not claimed that she “predicted” the attack but only that September 11 was among the days in September that she considered best for “avoiding” terrorist attacks. Palmer’s book is an exhaustive astrological guide that lists nearly 500 different categories of activity and thousands of dates that ought to be avoided.  It advises the best days for everything from cutting cloth to having surgery. Under the category of “Avoid: Terrorist Attacks” she listed more than 130 dates in 2001. For September, she listed 16 dates for avoiding terrorist attacks..  Since there are only 30 days in the month, she had better than a 50 percent chance of a terrorist attack happening on one of those days.

"," Updated! This has gotten a lot of attention in the email underground. There was a book found unharmed on a stool in a second-story office in the damaged portion of the Pentagon. A newspaper article quoted a soldier as saying it was a Bible. There are other reports from people who’ve seen pictures of the book on the stool and who speculate that it was a dictionary. None of the pictures of the book is close enough to tell what it is so, apart from the soldier’s story, there is no information from the scene otherwise. The original story was published in USA Today on September 14, 2001. Reporter Andrea Stone was interviewing solders on the scene of the Pentagon attack, one of whom was Sgt. Mark Williams who entered the building within four hours of the crash. Here is the portion of Stone’s article that talks about the Bible: “Yet, as he looked up into the black chasm torn into the symbol of the mightiest military in the world, Williams saw a sign of hope. On a second floor, right next to where the jet sheared off a section of the building, was an undisturbed stool. And on it was a thick, open book. Fellow searchers who had gotten a close look said it was a Bible. It was not burned. Nor was anything around it or on the two floors above it. ‘I’m not as religious as some, but that would have me thinking,’ the soldier said. ‘I just can’t explain it.'” Because of the level of interest in this story, TruthOrFiction.com has tried to find some first-hand information from soldiers or others who were on the scene. We have found other soldiers who were told that the book was a Bible, but we’ve not found any who actually saw it. There are pictures of the book on the stool and we’ve viewed them, but they are inconclusive. The book is large and it does not seem that there would be a Bible of that size in a Pentagon office, but that was the report from among soldiers on the evening of the crash. updated 11/25/01 ","9-11 Attack on America"

The crews from the American and German ships had spent some time together while both were moored in Plymouth, England. The Lutjens asked to come alongside of the Winston Churchill, and as it did, the Americans saw a moving and spectacular site. The German ship was flying an American flag at half-mast.

The eRumor started with a story published by the National Report, a fake news website that   often uses the names of real people in “semi-real or mostly fictitious   ways,” according to its disclaimer . The fake article cited a bogus Change.org petition titled, “No early release for Selena   Quintanilla-Perez’s murderer, Yolanda Salvidar,” that said: “The murderer of Selena Quintanilla-Perez is    slated to be released from prison early due to health issues. This    would be an abortion of justice. Please do not release this woman    who took the life of such a promising and talented woman. Yolanda    Saldivar needs to serve out the rest of her sentence, and be behind    bars for the remainder of her natural life.” A user named Beatriz Garcia created the petition.

The website TMZ reports that Salvidar could get an early release from prison if   she can prove that her health is deteriorating: “There are reports Yolanda Saldivar — who shot    and killed the Tejano icon in a hotel in 1995 — was in declining    health due to kidney failure and asked the Parole Board for an    immediate release. “But our sources say Saldivar has some medical    issues but none serious enough to warrant early release. What’s more    … she has NOT even filed a petition for early release.” Salvidar, the former president of Selena’s fan   club, was convicted in 1995 of murdering Selena.

Embassy Attack Was an Act Of Terrorism – Truth! Senate Report Singled Out State Department for Failing to Bolster Security- Truth! Summary of the eRumor: Two photographs taken of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens during the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya are circulating in forwarded emails. They allege that Ambassador Stevens was dragged through the streets in a preplanned attack while the Obama Administration has called it a protest over an Anti-Muslim video. "," The photos are real and were taken on September 11, 2012 from a video after Ambassador Stevens was found in the wreckage of the sacked Benghazi Outpost. The photos and video have been misinterpreted into something other than what they documented, a rescue. According to a September 18, 2012 article by the Associated Press, “Libyans tried to rescue Ambassador Chris Stevens, cheering ‘God is great’ and rushing him to a hospital after they discovered him still clinging to life inside the U.S. Consulate, according to witnesses and a new video that emerged Monday from last week’s attack in the city of Benghazi.” Eleven years after the terrorist attack of the World Trade Center in New York, there was an attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens along with three members of his U.S. embassy staff were killed. Shortly after that violence erupted around the world at the sites of various U.S. Embassies. Senate Hearing Report Released January 15, 2014 On January 15, 2014 the official report from the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearings was released. Click here for the report. Analysis of the Senate report by the New York Times said in a January 15, 2014 article that the September 11, 2012 attack “that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, could have been prevented, singling out the State Department for criticism for its failure to bolster security in response to intelligence warnings about a growing security crisis around the city.” Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during the incident. Was this a Preplanned Attack or a Protest of an Anti-Muslim Video on YouTube? At first, there were questions asking if this was a preplanned act of terrorism or a protest to an anti-Muslim video on the Internet. President Obama issued a statement about the deaths of Stevens and members of his staff and told the American public that an increase in security measures would be taken to protect U.S. Embassies and members serving in the U.S. diplomatic corps. Three days later Press Secretary Jay Carney, a briefing to reporters, denied any act of planned terrorism saying that the protests were in reaction to an anti-Muslim video. Press Secretary Carney at White House Briefing on YouTube A poorly produced video called Muhammad Movie Trailer that depicted the life of founder of Islam was posted last July on the popular video sharing website, YouTube.com,. We found other samples of the same video titled Innocence of Muslims. It portrayed the Islamic prophet in a satirical sense focusing on his sexual promiscuity and violent past. The video also showed the persecutions Jews by Muhammad as was as persecution of Christians in modern times. With all the negative videos and commentaries on the World Wide Web about Islam, could a fourteen minute video actually spark Muslims to react violently at U.S. Embassies around the world? Reports conflicting to the White House press statement allege that the attack was a strategically planned operation by Al Qaeda who called for the killing of American diplomats and used the protest of the video as a cover for their mission. In a September 16, 2016 article by Fox News, Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif told NPR in an interview that his country had been infiltrated by foreigners over the past few months and said, “We firmly believe that this was a precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to attack the U.S. Consulate.” In a September 19, 2012 article Fox News reported that Intelligence sources told them that the the news network that they were convinced that the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate Outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was directly tied to Al Qaeda and was led by a former Guantanamo detainee. The article also said, “in the face of these conflicting accounts, Carney on Tuesday deferred to the ongoing investigation and opened the door to the possibility of other explanations.” It took just over a week after the incident for the White House to finally admit that Americans and been attacked by terrorists. In a September 20, 2012 article Fox News reported that the White House “conceded Thursday that it was ‘self evident’ that it was an act of terror — an admission that took eight days for any administration official to make.” Press Secretary Carney told reporters, “”It is, I think, self evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently and the result was four deaths of American officials. That is self evident.” The White House announcement came after National Counterterrorism Center Director Matt Olsen confirmed the act of terrorism during a Senate hearing on September 19th saying, “Yes, they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy.” Posted 09/12/12 Updated 01/17/14 WARNING: The Images below are shocking and may not be suitable for younger audiences.

"," The eRumor about Delta Flight 15 is said to have been written by a member of the crew, Nazim-Amin. There are plenty of other stories, not only from the passengers of flight 15, but from people from the other more than 50 airplanes that found themselves stranded in Newfoundland when air traffic was shut down in the United States because of the terrorist hijacking of four airliners. The residents of Gander and some of her surrounding communities were so warm, hospitable, caring, and generous that the stranded travelers they helped seem unable to express how much it meant to them.  The stories from those days are numerous and inspiring. The passengers of Delta Flight 15 were not the only ones to have been warmed by the good folk of Gander and the surrounding communities.  As Nazim-Amin’s account says, there were many other flights that were stuck in Newfoundland.  The passengers from other planes experienced similar hospitality and a bonding amongst themselves…so much so that they are setting up websites to document their stories and to honor the people who helped them so much. Here are some of the sites and links: Delta Flight # 37 It was flying from London to Cincinnati.  Passenger Wayne Newland put together this site. CLICK HERE for details.

"Disney to Feature Openly Gay Characters – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/disney-features-openly-gay-characters/"," Disney plans to produce an animated feature film with two openly gay lead characters. "," Disney has not announced plans to produce an animated movie that features openly gay protagonists. The eRumor started with a story posted at the satirical website Amplifying Glass: “’Princes’ is an adaptation of the children’s  book, ‘The Princes and the Treasure,’ by Jeffrey A. Miles. In the  book, two handsome princes, Earnest and Gallant, set off to rescue a  princess, but fall in love with each other instead. The fairytale  story ends with the two princes getting married and living happily  ever after. The book has recently been released internationally  after initially being available in the United States in February of  2014.” The story was quickly shared more than 350,000 times after it was posted in November of 2014. Those readers, however, may have failed to read the website’s disclaimer : “If you are looking for real breaking news  stories, you have arrived at the wrong location. Nearly everything  that we produce is designed to make you laugh and/or poke fun at the  ridiculous nature of life in America. You would do well not to take  anything that we say here too seriously.” “The Princes and the Treasure” is a real book by Jeffrey A. Miles, as described in the eRumor, but Disney hasn’t announced plans to make it into a full-length animated feature. But Disney did break new ground when it introduced openly gay characters on the Disney Channel for the first time in January of 2014. The characters appeared in the show “Good Luck Charlie,” TV Guide reports : “In the storyline, parents Amy and Bob Duncan  (played by Leigh-Allyn Baker and Eric Allan Kramer) set up a play  date for their preschooler Charlie (Mia Talerico) with one of her  new pals, who happens to have two mothers.” A video clip of the scene can be viewed HERE . A Disney rep said the storyline was developed under the “consultancy of child development experts and community advisors.” Still, the episode drew opposition from groups like One Million Moms, which, via the Huffington Post, said : “Conservative families need to urge Disney to  avoid controversial topics that children are far too young to  comprehend. This is the last place a parent would expect their  children to be confronted with topics that are too difficult for  them to understand. Mature issues of this nature are being  introduced too early and too soon, and it is extremely unnecessary.” TruthorFiction.com contacted the publishers of “The Princes and the Treasure” for comment on any plans to develop the book into a movie. Future updates will be posted here. ","9-11 Attack on America"

A number of concerned residents contacted local authorities after hearing reports about the mysterious whale, the Salt Lake Tribune reports : “A Davis Count dispatcher confirmed to the  Salt Lake Tribune that, no, there was no whale — but they did  receive a bunch of calls from people who saw the story.” The photo that accompanied the eRumor, however, does show a whale carcass that appeared in a field under unusual circumstances.

"," It is not true.  CNN has officially denied the claim.  Also, the person who originated the email has now said that his information was wrong and he no longer believes the story. It is true that there were Palestinians dancing in the streets and celebrating the terrorist attacks.  A spokesperson for CNN told TruthOrFiction.com that the footage they used was authentic and was taken shortly after the terrorist attacks. It is regarded as unethical among reputable news organizations to use film or video from one event and represent it as being from another event.  When footage is used from a time or place other than what is being reported, it is customary to indicate that for the viewer.  If it had been proven that CNN used 10-year-old pictures as though they were current, it would have been a major embarrassment. The eRumor got its start from a university student in Brazil.  He said that a teacher of his had videotapes from 1991 that proved that CNN had mislead its viewers and had complained to CNN and other news organizations about it.  The student was deluged with requests about the teacher’s claims so he contacted her outside of class about it and he says she denied having any videotapes.  She is quoted as having said only that she remembers seeing the footage in 1991, even though she told the class differently.

It makes a number of claims about the salaries of CEOs and the use of donor dollars. "," This forwarded email makes outdated or false claims about which non-profit groups you should avoid. The efficiency and effectiveness of charitable groups is an important consideration for donors. But any claim that a non-profit group dedicates 100 percent of its donations to its mission is false. Every group has to pay overhead costs for things like employee salaries and fundraising initiatives, but some groups do a better job of managing those costs. This email typically begins recirculating each holiday season. In 2016, it began circulating under the healdine” Christmas is Coming — Donating Items or Money to Charities … Which ones?” But the “new” email was just the same list of outdated and inaccurate claims that you’ll find below. TruthofFiction.com looked at each of the eRumor’s claims and used the most recent available tax information to determine whether they are true or false. Here’s our findings: American Red Cross President and CEO Marsha J. Evans’ salary for the year was $651,957, plus expenses – Fiction! This claim is untrue and outdated. Evans stepped down as the president and CEO of the American Red Cross in 2005. In 2013, American Red Cross President and CEO Gail McGovern was paid a $517,000 salary in 2015 , which was about .01 percent of the organization’s expenses. Charity Navigator rated the American Red Cross’s overall performance at 83.33 out of 100. March of Dimes is called the March of Dimes because only a dime for every $1 is given to the needy – Fiction! This claim is false. In 2014, March of Dimes reported generating about $195.8 million in revenue, and about 66 percent of that amount went to program expenses directly supporting its mission, 22 percent went to fundraising, and just about 10 percent went to administrative expenses. The charity ran a $7.9 million deficit for the year. Charity Navigator rated March of Dimes’ overall performance at 71.86 out of 100. This claim wasn’t accurate in 2012, when the email first went viral, either. That year March of Dimes reported about $205 million in revenue. Administrative expenses totaled about $23 million, and the organization spent about $196 million on fundraising and programming (it ran a $12 million deficit in 2012). March of Dimes dedicates much more than 10 percent of its revenue to the needy. United Way President Brian Gallagher receives a $375,000 base salary, plus benefits – Fiction! Gallagher’s salary is actually was actually much higher in 2014 than reported in the email. He was paid $1.3 million, which accounted for about 1.4 percent of the nonprofit’s total expenses. Still, Gallagher’s salary wasn’t out of line with the CEOs of similarly sized organizations. Charity Navigator rated the United Way’s overall performance at 92.99 out of 100. UNICEF CEO Caryl Stern receives $1.2 million per year, plus expenses and use of a Rolls Royce – Fiction! This claim is false. Stern earned a $476,000 base salary in 2013 and about $515,000 in 2015, accounting for 0.09 of the organization’s total expenses. UNICEF also said it does not provide a Rolls Royce, or any company car, for its staff. Charity Navigator rated UNICEF’s overall performance at 85.64 out of 100 in 2015. Goodwill CEO Mark Curran takes in $2.3 million per year – Fiction! This claim is false. Mark Curran has never been the CEO of Goodwill Industries International. That position is held by Jim Gibbons, and he earned $585,604 in reportable compensation and $126,598 in “other compensations” from the organization in 2015, according to tax forms. Goodwill Industries says 83 cents of every dollar it receives go to programs and services for people in need. Salvation Army Commissioner Todd Bassett earns $13,000 per year – Fiction! This claim has persisted for years, and it’s false. Todd Bassett retired from active service in 2006. Before that, Bassett and his wife received $79,389 per year in salary and $53,468 in benefits, the organization reports . In the most recent financial disclsoures, William A Roberts, the organization’s chief executive, earned $131, 243 in compensation and benefits . About 18 percent of the Salvation Army’s revenues are spent on administrative costs . American Legion’s top commanders receive no compensation – Fiction! This claim is false. A tax form reveals that its top officers received about $201,000, $152,000 and $162,000 in compensation in 2009.  The organization does not make more detailed information about program expenses available. Veterans of Foreign Wars national commander receives no salary – Fiction! VFW National Commander Richard Eubank received a $238,221 salary in 2009. Richard Freiburghouse, manager of the VFW Foundation, also earned $75,000 that year. The group spends about 8% of its revenues on administrative expenses . Disabled American Veterans national commander receives no salary – Fiction! Ronald Hope, a veteran of the Vietnam War, is listed as the national commander of DAV, and his salary information isn’t made clear in tax documents . But J. Marc Burgess is the national adjutant and chief executive of the organization, and his compensation is listed at about $319,000 per year. Charity Navigator rated DAV’s overall performance at 91.25 out of 100. The Military Order of Purple Hearts  National Commander receives no salary – Unproven! The Military Order of Purple Hearts does not include salary information for its national commander in its tax documents . The group paid Stephen Ruckman, its chief financial officer, about $150,000 in 2009. That year, the group also reported a $40,000 severance payment to its former executive director. Vietnam Veterans Association national commander receives no salary- Fiction! There is no known Vietnam Veterans Association; Vietnam Veterans of America appears to be the closest match. In 2009, the group paid President John Rowan $69,874 and CFO Joseph Sternberg $137,000, according to tax documents . The group does not make more detailed financial information available online. Make-A-Wish Foundation dedicates 100% of funds to programs – Fiction! It’s not true that the Make-A-Wish Foundation has no overhead or administrative costs. The organization dedicates about 73.3% of revenues to programs. Meanwhile, administration accounts for 11.3% of its spending, and fundraising initiatives account for about 15.4%. David A. Williams, the president and CEO of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, earned $479,676 in 2013. Charity Navigator rates the Make-A-Wish Foundation’s overall performance 81.31 out of 100. St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital dedicates 100% of funds to programs for children – Fiction! This claim is false. St. Jude’s spent less than 70% of its budget on programs for children in 2013. Administration accounted for 10% of the organization’s spending and fundraising accounted for 20%. Charity Navigator rates St. Jude’s overall performance 86.63 out of 100. Ronald McDonald House dedicates all donations to programs – Fiction! The Ronald McDonald House operates very efficiently, but this claim is false. The organization dedicated about 89 percent of its budget to programming in 2013. Administration accounted for less than 1%, and fundraising accounted for about 9% of its operating budget. Charity Navigator rates the Ronald McDonald House’s overall performance at 97.72 out of 100. Lions Club International dedicates 100% of donations to the blind, deaf and measles vaccinations- Fiction! This claim is false. Lion’s Club International dedicates about 83% of its budget to programs for the blind, deaf and others. Administration accounts for about 8% and fundraising accounts for about 7% of its total budget. It is true that the Lion’s Club International has launched a worldwide measles vaccination campaign .

"Your Extra Virgin Olive Oil Could Be Fake-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/your-extra-virgin-olive-oil-could-be-fake/"," Much of the extra virgin olive oil sold in the U.S. is fake because it’s made with genetically modified soybeans and unapproved chemicals. "," Many shoppers have been squeezed into buying cheap (or even fake) olive oil over the years, so this eRumor is true. Claims that some brands of extra virgin olive oil are cut with soybean or vegetable oils have been around for years. And some in the olive oil industry have drawn heat for using labels that make it hard to tell where their products come from, and what quality they are. A chain email that outlines some of those claims made the rounds in early 2015. It was based on a story that appeared in the New York Times opinion section in January of 2014: “Much of the oil sold as Italian olive oil does not come from Italy,  but from countries like Spain, Morocco and Tunisia … The oil is then  pumped into a tanker truck and shipped to Italy, the world’s largest  importer of olive oil. Meanwhile, shipments of soybean oil and other  cheap oils are labeled olive oil, and smuggled into the same port.  At some refineries, the olive oil is cut with cheaper oil. Other  refineries are even worse. They mix vegetable oils with  beta-carotene, to disguise the flavor, and chlorophyll for coloring,  to produce fake olive oil. Bottles are labeled ‘Extra Virgin’ and  branded with ‘Packed in Italy’ or ‘imported from Italy.’ Oddly, this  is legal, even if the oil does not come from Italy — although the  source countries are supposed to be listed on the label.” You should look for the phrase “produced in Italy” if you want to make sure that’s where your olive oil came from. Some of the other claims came from a study by the UC-Davis Olive Center (yes, UC-Davis has an Olive Center). Researchers carried out a yearlong study that evaluated olive oil based on standards set by the International Olive Council (IOC). Sadly for lovers of olive oil, 73% of the top five extra virgin olive oil brands sold in the U.S. failed. That means, researchers said, “These samples are oxidized, of poor quality, and/or adulterated with cheaper refined oils.” Other forms of olive oil fraud have been around even longer. In 2007, author Tom Mueller covered the problem for New Yorker magazine: “The American market, which is worth about one and a half billion  dollars, is the largest outside Europe, and is growing at a rate of  ten percent a year. Yet the Food and Drug Administration considers  olive-oil fraud a relatively rare problem and does not  routinely test oils for adulteration. Instead, the agency relies on  major producers and trade groups, like the North American Olive Oil  Association — whose members include several companies that also  belong to ASSITOL — to alert it to suspicious products. With the  industry acting as a watchdog, Martin Stutsman, a specialist  in adulterated food at the F.D.A., told me, “you don’t waste your  resources on surveys that are likely to make somebody comfortable  but that don’t do much toward protecting the public health.” “In February, 2006, federal marshals seized about sixty-one thousand  litres of what was supposedly extra-virgin olive oil and  twenty-six thousand litres of a lower-grade olive oil from a New  Jersey warehouse. Some of the oil, which consisted almost entirely  of soybean oil, was destined for a company called Krinos Foods,  a member of the North American Olive Oil Association. Krinos blamed  the fraud on its supplier, DMK Global Marketing, which in turn  blamed the Italian bottlers from whom it had bought the oil. The  marshals destroyed the oil, but no criminal charges were  brought against Krinos or any other companies. “My experience over a  period of some fifty years suggests that we can always expect  adulteration and mislabeling of olive-oil products in the absence of  surveillance by official sources,” David Firestone, an F.D.A.  chemist who was the agency’s olive-oil specialist from the  mid-sixties to 1999, told me.” Tom Mueller went on to write a book on olive oil fraud called, “ Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil .” In 2012, the USDA expanded its Quality Monitoring Program and included extra virgin olive oil. Olive oil producers were “invited” to voluntarily comply, but that didn’t pan out. Time reports : “Even though concerns over poor quality, mislabeling and  outright fraud surfaced a few years ago, olive oil continues to be  plagued with credibility issues, even as it finds its way into more  American homes and countries around the globe attempt to set  quality-control standards. The state of extra-virgin olive oil  — which is extracted from olives via mechanical means, not chemicals  or heat — has been particularly controversial. While some industry  insiders insist that stories of rampant adulteration are  greatly exaggerated, others beg to differ… “In the hope of improving matters, the USDA invited olive-oil brands to comply voluntarily with its Quality Monitoring Program. But so far only one company — Pompeian, the second largest olive-oil bottler in the U.S. — has chosen to participate. To do so, Pompeian officials say, they have had to greatly increase the size of their quality-control department, spending “several hundred thousand dollars” for staffing, training, research and record keeping.” After a long history of fraud and scandal in the olive oil industry, the moral of the story is to be careful when shopping for extra virgin olive oil.

"Wal-Mart Now Offering Halal Meat – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/wal-mart-now-offering-halal-meat/"," Wal-Mart stocks Halal meat in its grocery departments in an effort to cater to the dietary restrictions of Muslim shoppers. "," Wal-Mart stocks Halal chicken in about 175 of its grocery departments across the United States. A Wal-Mart spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that the halal offerings are part of regional programs used to meet the varying needs of the communities it serves. “It’s important to remind folks that we’re the nation’s largest grocer, and we serve a broad cross-section of America,” the spokesperson said. “There are 140 million customers who shop at our stores in a given week, and they come from all walks of life.” And Wal-Mart’s regional programs don’t just cater to Muslims. The retailer also stocks more Kosher products in areas populated by Jewish customers and expanded seafood selections in predominantly Catholic communities during lent, the spokesperson added. The eRumor surfaced in November of 2014 after a Wal-Mart manager announced that he would stock halal meat at a location in Oxford, Ohio. The manager made the decision after requests from students at the University of Miami in Ohio, the Miami Student  campus publication reports : “Upon the request of Muslim students at Miami University, Walmart recently made the decision to provide halal-certified meat at the Oxford location. Store manager Elijah Woodard made a formal announcement on Oct. 21 that the store would be accommodating these requests. ‘I appreciated the students bringing this interest to our attention,’ Woodard said. ‘I am pleased to announce that we have set a halal meat section in the store.’’” A visiting assistant professor who made the request with members of the Muslim Student Association told the student newspaper that the closest retailer that sold halal meat had previously been about 40 miles away in Cincinnati. The Wal-Mart spokesperson confirmed to TruthorFiction.com that the retailer had determined there was enough demand to stock halal chicken at the store in Oxford. Some opponents of the announcement said Wal-Mart had pandered to Sharia Law, the moral code and religious law of Islam. Some social media users sounded off with statements like this one: “Time to BOYCOTT ALL SUPERMARKETS selling HALAL!!!” In recent years, retailers have had to balance public opposition to halal product offerings with what’s best for their bottom lines, Bloomberg Businessweek report ed in 2010: “While corporations have long catered to Muslim communities in Europe, businesses have only tentatively started to follow suit in the U.S. — and they are doing so at a time of intensified anti-Muslim feeling that companies worry could hurt them, too. American Muslims seeking more acknowledgment in the marketplace argue that businesses have more to gain than lose by reaching out to the community. The worldwide market for Islamically permitted goods, called halal, has grown to more than half a billion dollars annually. Ritually slaughtered meat is a mainstay, but the halal industry is much broader, including foods and seasoning that omit alcohol, pork products and other forbidden ingredients, along with cosmetics, finance and clothing.” Halal products can have added benefits for non-Muslim consumers, too. The Wal-Mart spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that its halal chicken, for example, has appealed to many non-Muslim customers because it doesn’t include antibiotics. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Wounded Warriors Project is a Fraud – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/wounded-warriors-project-is-a-fraud/"," The Wounded Warriors Project is a fraud and dedicates a small percentage of its proceeds to assisting veterans who were wounded in the line of duty and organizations that support them. "," This claim is false. In fiscal year 2013, the Wounded Warriors Foundation took in $234 million in donations and dedicated 80 percent of that amount to programs for wounded veterans, according to tax records . The eRumor’s claim that the organization spends just 3.5% of its total income on grants for individuals and veteran organizations is misleading. The Wounded Warriors Foundation began awarding grants to veteran organizations with similar goals in 2012, the year cited by the eRumor, and the amount it awards in grants has increased dramatically since. The Wounded Warriors Foundation reports : Since its inception in 2012, WWP Program Grants has held two grant  cycles each year. WWP Program Grants are awarded in amounts up to  250,000 and last one full year from the date of award. Our in-depth grant evaluation process ensures WWP provides financial  support to groups espousing kindred priorities and policies, and  with the same commitment to our mission to honor and empower Wounded  Warriors. Historically, WWP has supported organizations that seek to  enhance the lives of wounded service members through programs aimed  at improving mental health and wellness; exposing wounded service  members to new opportunities for physical fitness and activity;  connecting wounded service members with their peers and communities;  and enhancing economic empowerment and independence. In 2013, the Wounded Warriors Foundation reported that it paid $16.8 million in grants to other veteran organizations. And the claim that the group pays less than $1 million in grants to individual veterans is also false. Various organizations that receive grants from the Wounded Warriors Foundation use that money to provide direct assistance to disabled veterans, and those figures aren’t reflected in the eRumor’s claim. In just one grant cycle in 2014, a number of grant recipients provided direct support to veterans, according to the Wounded Warriors Foundation: 2014 SECOND CYCLE GRANT RECIPIENTS Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans – Homelessness Prevention: MACV offers short-term assistance when payment or service will  resolve the veteran’s current crisis. Assistance includes direct  payments for rent/mortgage, security deposits, transportation,  utilities, food, clothing, and more. This direct assistance helps  veterans to continue concentrating on long-term stabilization goals  to obtain secure housing and employment. US Vets – Homelessness Prevention: Wrap-Around Shelter and Support Services for Homeless Veterans  provides housing, meals, mental health counseling, case management,  and employment services to post 9/11 veterans and their families who  are homeless or at-risk for homelessness. Veterans One-stop Center of Western New York – Military to  Civilian Transition: The Warrior Transition & Integration Assistance Program assists  warriors with their transition and integration to civilian life  through the collaborative provision of integrated care management.  Direct services focus on homelessness prevention, workforce  readiness and development, family resiliency/reintegration, and  other supportive services to help empower warriors to complete their  transition and integration. Variations of this eRumor also make claims about so-called excessive salaries that Wounded Warrior Foundation executives earn. Steven Nardizzi, the executive director of the group, earned $375,000 in 2013, according to the independent website Charity Navigator . That’s on par with the average salary of executives from other non-profits. Overall, the Wounded Warriors Foundation receives high marks for its overall performance, financial efficiency and transparency. Charity Navigator rated its overall performance at 86.11 out of a possible 100 for fiscal year 2013. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Valerie Jarrett has never identified herself as a Muslim, and there’s no record of her saying that she wanted to help make America more like Islamic countries. A social media post that went viral claimed that Valerie Jarrett uttered a comment making America more Islamic while she was attending school at Stanford University in 1977: “I am a Iranian by birth and of my Islamic faith. I am also an  American and I seek to help change America to be a more Islamic  country. My faith guides me and I feel like it is going well in the  transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself.” The quote’s sentence construction isn’t consistent with the way American students at high-level universities like Stanford talk. It appears to have been said by someone who isn’t very familiar with the English language. In 1977, Valerie Jarrett was a junior at Stanford and had been living in the U.S. since the age of 5. It’s unlikely she would say something like, “I am a Iranian by birth and of my Islamic faith.” In truth, Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran — but to American parents. Her father was a geneticist and pathologist named Dr. James Bowman who was born in Washington, D.C. In 1955, he accepted a position in Iran to study favism, a glucose deficiency disease. Valerie Jarrett’s mother, Barbara Bowman , was born in Chicago and became a professor and expert in early childhood education. Valerie Jarrett was born while her parents were in Shiraz, Iran, in 1956. The family lived in London from 1961-1962 while James Bowman studied genetics. Then, the family moved to Chicago, the Stanford Alumni reports : “Jarrett grew up in Hyde Park, the racially diverse neighborhood  that abuts the University of Chicago, where her father worked. She  went to Massachusetts for prep school, and on to the Farm  (Stanford). Her conviction to attend Stanford was so strong it  didn’t even occur to her to visit beforehand.” Valerie Jarrett earned a degree in psychology at Stanford and then earned a law degree from the University of Michigan. She entered politics in the 1980s, working for former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. It was while traveling in Chicago’s social and political circles that Jarrett met Barack and Michelle Obama. Valerie Jarrett has served as a senior advisor to President Obama since his inauguration — and it’s true that a number of former White House staffers like press secretary Robert Gibbs and chief of staff Rahm Emanual reportedly resigned or were fired after run-ins with Jarrett, as the eRumor claims. The press has also had an uncomfortable relationship with Valerie Jarrett, with a number of news outlets reporting that it’s not clear exactly what she does in the White House. Politico reports : “For starters, even today, nobody knows precisely what Jarrett does  in the White House. What exactly do her titles—senior advisor to the  president, assistant to the president in charge of the Office  of Intergovernmental Affairs, the Office of Public Engagement, the  White House Council on Women and Girls—mean? More to the point,  Jarrett has often used the aura of authority that these titles give  her to stand in the way of talented White House staffers and a  smoother-running administration, according to several books that  have been written about the Obama presidency.” So, Valerie Jarrett has had a number of well-documented run-ins with former White House staffers and has faced questions about what exactly her role in the Obama Administration is. But claims about Jarrett’s religious beliefs, or her intention to make America more like Islamic countries are false. ","9-11 Attack on America"

Do you have problems with indigestion? Have you taken antibiotics in the last five years? Do you regularly eat any sugary foods such as fruit or honey? If you said “yes” to any of the above, your belly is most likely swarming with what some doctors are calling “the Vampire Fungus.” This fungus grows and grows over time and often masquerades as fat because it can swell in your stomach to the size of a basketball. The warning signs described in the video — weight gain, skin problems, indigestion, use of antibiotics in the last five years — apply to virtually every adult in America. The narrator does not specify what Vampire Fungus is, where it comes from, or how the video can help viewers overcome it. The video does, however, cite a study carried out by researchers at Rice University that allegedly concluded that the Vampire Fungus affected up to 70% of Americans. An actual Rice University study that was published in 2004 found that up to 70% of Americans had colonies of a yeast-like parasitic fungus called Candida living in their intestines: Candida is common in humans. It’s estimated that 70 percent of people have Candida colonies in their intestines, mouths or on their skin. In most cases, the organism is commensal, meaning it does not harm people, even though it depends upon them for food. However, colonies of Candida sometimes grow too large, as happens in the case of yeast infections. While not life-threatening, vaginal yeast infections are a common and painful problem for a significant percentage of American women. The oral form of Candida infection, known as thrush, is a common problem for infants. The researchers at Rice University did not refer to Candida as a “Vampire Fungus,” nor did they describe its effects on the human body in the same way as the eRumor does. Research dating back to the 1990s indicates that probiotic bacteria — live microorganisms and yeasts — may be an effective way to counter parasitic bacteria like Candida in the intestines. A 1997 study by the National Institutes of Health found: Four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Each bacterial species and Candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. The presence of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, or Bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with C. albicans alone. The incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. Leaf Origin, the company listed as the producer of the Vampire Fungus video, happens to sell a daily probiotic supplement that claims to promote digestive immune system health. The supplement cost $157 for a 180-day supply. It would appear that the term “Candida” was changed to “Vampire Fungus” in the video  to scare up sales. TruthorFiction.com has reached out to Leaf Origin for comment on the video. Future updates will be posted here. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Vinegar and Water Can Deice a Windshield – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/vinegar-and-water-can-deice-a-windshield/"," A mixture of vinegar and water sprayed onto a frosty windshield acts as a cheap and effective deicer. "," Vinegar can help melt ice, but it’s not an effective windshield deicer. Various websites have repeated the claim that a 3:1 or 2:1 mix of vinegar and warm water act as a deicer. The eRumor goes viral each year as the winter months approach: A homemade solution of vinegar and water can help in scraping the ice off a windshield. The acidity in vinegar will make the ice melt and allow you to use less effort to scrape the ice away. The homemade vinegar-water solution will also save money because you will no longer need to purchase expensive windshield deicer for your car. In reality, all you have to do to make ice melt faster is lower the freezing point of water by adding particles to it. Salt, sugar, and almost anything else that forms a solution with water can be used, according to UC-Santa Barbara’s ScienceLine . Temperature is an indication of how fast particles such as molecules, atoms, and ions are vibration . When liquid water is in contact with ice at the freezing temperature, liquid water molecules are vibrating slow enough to be captured on the surface of the ice… The rate of capture and escape is the same, and so the ice will remain as ice and the liquid water will remain as liquid water. Salt is the most common additive used to speed up the vibration of particles in water to melt ice, but there are plenty of alternatives. Vinegar is mostly made up of acetic acid , which has been billed as a possible alternative to salt-based deicer, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reports : Acetic acid has numerous uses as an industrial chemical, which need no further elaboration. Some of the salts of acetic acid are relatively new. For example, (Calcium-Magnesium Acetate) is being promoted as a road salt substitute. The cost of CMA may seem high compared to chloride road salts, which are available for $20-40/ton. However, we pay a much higher net price when the effects of chloride salts are considered, e.g., damage to highways, bridges, concrete structures, vehicles, roadside vegetation, ground water contamination and other environment effects. The FAA has even approved CMA for use as a runway deicer at airports. But that doesn’t mean that you’ll have much luck deicing your windshield with diluted vinegar. The mixture may help lower ice’s melting point some and speed up the thawing process if the outside temperature is warm enough, but it would likely be more trouble than it’s worth. In a video of an unscientific vinegar-water deicing experiment carried out by a radio station, the mixture took the top layer of ice off the windshield, but an ice scraper would have been needed to finish the job. Still, many people argue that the vinegar and water mixture works if it’s sprayed on a windshield before ice forms. That claim has circulated for decades, as evidenced in this newspaper column from 1992: Question: I keep my car outdoors at night during the winter. I use one of those cardboards on the windshield but it still ices and frosts up. What can I do to stop this? Answer: Dip a sponge or cloth into a solution of three parts of either white or yellow vinegar to one part of water. The windshield should stay ice-free. Repeat occasionally. Another theory is that a windshield coated in vinegar and water will still freeze, but the sheet of ice that forms will be easier to remove. The Glass Doctor website says : Pour a mixture of vinegar and water on the windshield so that it freezes to the glass before the rain does, thereby preventing ice. Unfortunately, vinegar eats pits into the windshield glass. However, the claim that vinegar eats into windshields may be overblown. The only types of chemicals that aggressively attack glass are hydrofluoric acid, concentrated phosphoric acid, concentrated alkali solutions and superheated water, according to the Corning Museum of Glass .  Regardless, be forewarned that vinegar could damage your vehicle’s paint or metalwork, so sticking with an old fashioned ice scraper might be your best bet.

"UC-Irvine Students Ban American Flag on Campus – Previously Truth! Now Resolved!","2015-03-17 20:38:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/uc-irvine-students-ban-american-flag-on-campus/"," The American flag has been banned from the UC-Irvine campus. "," This one was true, but it has been resolved. UC-Irvine’s student government passed a resolution that would have banned all national flags — including the American flag — in the lobby of student government offices because some students find them offensive. The Executive Cabinet of the Associated Students of UC-Irvine (ASUCI), the university’s student government, vetoed it in less than a week. The resolution said that the flags should be taken down because “designing a culturally inclusive space is taken seriously by ASUCI.” The resolution went on to talk about how people view the symbolism of flags differently: “Whereas flags construct paradigms of conformity and sets  homogenized standards for others to obtain which in this country  typically are idolized as freedom, equality, and democracy. “Whereas symbolism is interpreted differently by different groups or  persons based on individual unique experiences. “Whereas a common ideological understanding of the United states  includes American exceptionalism and superiority. “Whereas the American flag is commonly flown in government public  service locations, military related entities, at homes, in foreign  lands where the U.S. government has a presence. “Whereas the American flag has been flown in instances of  colonialism and imperialism. “Whereas symbolism has negative and positive aspects that are  interpreted differently by individuals. “Whereas displaying a flag does not express only selective aspects  of its symbolism but the entire spectrum of its interpretation. “Whereas designing a culturally inclusive space is taken seriously  by ASUCI.” UC-Irvine Chancellor Howard Gillman said the university’s administration “swiftly, strongly and publicly denounced the action.” Gillman continued : “Importantly, UCI students also immediately began to express their  disappointment and outrage at the actions of these six students. Our  elected student body president condemned the action, calling the  decision ‘horrible’ and ‘an attack on American values.’ Those news  organizations that sought a truthful account of the issue, and that  interviewed UCI students, found one student after another saying  that the views of these six did not represent the students at UCI.” The ASUCI Executive Cabinet vetoed the resolution on March 8, 2015, and said that it was “counter to the ideals” of the university: “We fundamentally disagree with the actions taken by ASUCI  Legislative Council and their passage of R50-70 as counter to the  ideals that allow us to operate as an autonomous student government  organization with the freedoms of speech and expression associated  with it. It is these very symbols that represent our  constitutional rights that have allowed for our representative  creation and our ability to openly debate all ranges of issues and  pay tribute to how those liberties were attained.” Matthew Guevara, a student in the university’s school of social ecology, wrote the resolution .  Six members of the ASUCI Legislative Council approved it. Four members voted against it, and two weren’t there for the vote. The effort to ban flags from UC-Irvine’s student government offices drew national media attention. California State Sen. Janet Nguyen (R-Santa Ana) said lawmakers might introduce a constitutional amendment that would prohibit “state-funded universities and college campuses from banning the United States flag,” the Washington Post reports .

"Six Corporations Own 90% of News Media – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/six-corporations-own-90-percent-of-news-media/"," Six corporations own 90% of news media companies in America. "," This claim is true. News Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, CBS and Comcast own 90% of the TV stations, radio stations, movies, magazines and newspapers that 277 million Americans rely on for news and entertainment. The consolidation of news and entertainment media companies gained attention in early 2015 when an infographic that depicts six media corporations’ chain of ownership went viral on social media. The infographic is mostly accurate, but it’s a little out of date. It lists General Electric as the owner of NBC, Focus Features, Comcast and Universal Pictures, but General Electric sold its media holdings to Comcast in 2013. That means Comcast has replaced General Electric as one of the six corporations that control 90% of the media. Media consolidation has been on a fast march over the last 30 years. In 1983, 50 companies owned 90% of American media. Over that time, Congress and the FCC have largely deregulated the media industry. The number of television stations that one company can own jumped from seven to 12 in 1985. The FCC also stopped enforcing the Fairness Doctrine , it dropped requirements for a minimum amount of non-entertainment programming, and it lifted limits on the amount of advertising that could be broadcast in one hour. Those changes made it easier and more profitable for corporations to own more media properties. Then, in 1996, President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act , which led to rapid consolidation of the radio industry because it lifted a 40-station ownership cap. A 2004 appeals court decision also struck down even more media ownership rules.

"Smithsonian Admits Destroying Giant Human Skeletons – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/smithsonian-admits-destroying-giant-human-skeletons/"," I n an effort preserve the mainstream chronology of human evolution, the Smithsonian destroyed skeletal remains of giant humans found across the U.S. "," This story is a hoax based on theories about giant skeletons that have persisted for hundreds of years. A fake news report by the World News Daily Report claimed that recently-released documents dating back to the early 1900s proved that the Smithsonian had destroyed tens of thousands of giant human skeletons in a “major historical cover up.”  The article claimed that the remains were destroyed because “mainstream archeology can not admit to” their existence. Despite the website’s disclosure that its content is intended for “entertainment purposes,” the story was quickly shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. The website publishes satirical articles and accompanying photos in a way that makes them appear real. But readers who were duped by the story shouldn’t feel bad. A number of websites and groups have formed around the theory that the skeletal remains of giants have been found around the U.S. since the early 1800s. The History Channel has even featured the show, “ Search for the Lost Giants ,” on the subject. A speech delivered by Abe Lincoln during a visit to Niagara Falls in 1848 is often used to lend credibility to the giant skeleton theory. Speaking about the unique appeal of the Niagara Falls, Lincoln said : “But still  there is more. It calls up the indefinite past. When Columbus first  sought this continent — when Christ suffered on the cross — when  Moses led Israel through the Red-Sea — nay, even when Adam first  came from the hand of his Maker — then as now, Niagara was roaring  here. The eyes of that species of extinct giants, whose bones fill  the mounds of America, have gazed on Niagara, as ours do.” Lincoln appeared to embrace the idea that ancient giants had once walked the United States. The view wasn’t all that uncommon among influential figures of the time, either. The book “ The Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee ,” written by attorney and historian John Haywood in 1823, attempted to prove that native tribes of Tennessee were descendants of giant ancient Hebrews. In his book, Haywood writes: “In White County, a conical mound was lately opened, and in the centre of it was found a skeleton eight feet in length … With this skeleton was found another nearly of the same size, with the top of his head flat, and his eyes placed apparently in the upper part of his forehead. The descendants of these giants, both in the old and new world, agree with each other in bulk, as their ancestors did with each other, which proves a uniform cause operating equally both in the old and new world. The decrease in bulk seems to have kept pace everywhere with the increase of warm temperature, and with the abbreviation of longevity. The giants of Hebron and Gath, and those of Laconia and Italy, whose large skeletons to this day attest that there they formerly dwelt, compared with those now found in West Tennessee, demonstrate that a change of climate, or of some other cause, has worked a remarkable change in the human system.” Haywood was an influential and respected figure, which lends credibility to his work. At the time of the book’s publication, Haywood was a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court, and a county in Tennessee was named after him the same year it was published. However, Haywood’s work was later criticized for inaccuracies. It’s believed that Haywood interviewed early pioneers and recounted undependable second-hand accounts of their discoveries in his books. So, while conspiracy theories about the skeletons of giants in the U.S. have persisted for hundreds of years, nobody has actually found one. And the eRumor’s claim that the Smithsonian has plotted to keep it that way is false. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," This one is true. An audit by the Social Security Administration (SSA) Inspector General found that 6.5 million people who would be at least 112 years old still have active Social Security numbers. That’s a problem because The Centenarian, a website that provides statistics and info on aging, estimated that no more than 72,000 people living in the U.S. were older than 100 at the end of 2014. The Inspector General audit concluded that the SSA system isn’t able to “annotate death information” on the records of number holders that are much older than reasonable life expectancies. That has led to 6.5 million people who were born before 1901 being considered “alive” by the SSA. Identity fraud is the main problem with this. The audit found that one man opened two bank accounts using the Social Security numbers of people who were born in 1869 and 1893. Neither of them appeared in the Death Master File because of the glitch, so they were both considered to be alive. Thousands more of the Social Security numbers could have also been used to commit identity fraud, according to the report : “For Tax Years 2006 through 2011, SSA received reports  that individuals using 66,920 SSNs had approximately $3.1 billion in  wages, tips, and self-employment income. SSA  transferred the earnings to the Earnings Suspense File because  the employees’ or self-employed individuals’ names on the earnings  reports did not match the numberholders’ names. “During Calendar Years 2008 through 2011, employers made 4,024  E-Verify inquiries using 3,873 SSNs belonging to numberholders born  before June 16, 1901.” Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Tom Carper (D-Del.), leaders of the committee that oversees the SSA, said in a joint statement that the errors must be corrected: “It is incredible that the Social Security Administration in 2015  does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people  they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead,” Johnson said.  “This problem has serious consequences. Tens of thousands of these  numbers are currently being used to report wages to the Social  Security Administration and to the IRS. People are fraudulently, but  successfully, applying for jobs and benefits with these numbers.  Making sure Social Security cleans up its death master file to  prevent future errors and fraud is a good government reform we can  all agree on. “Not only do these types of avoidable errors waste millions of  taxpayers’ dollars annually and expose our citizens to identify  theft, but they also undermine confidence in our government,” Carper  said. “It is simply unacceptable that our nation’s database of  Social Security numbers of supposedly living people includes more  than six and a half million people who are older than 112 years of  age, with a few thousand having birth dates from before the Civil  War.  Preventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a  relatively simple problem that the government should pursue as a  high priority.” ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," It’s true that some Samsung smart TVs with voice recognition listen to and record users’ voices, including private conversations. But the voice recognition technology has been misunderstood. It only “listens” for specific commands, and it only records voices when a button on the remote control is pushed, so it’s misleading to say that Samsung Smart TVs listen to private conversations. The claim first surfaced when the news magazine The Daily Beast reported in February of 2015 that a sentence buried deep in a Samsung privacy policy opened the door for the company to spy on its users: “Careful what you say around your TV. It may be listening. And blabbing. A single sentence buried in a dense ‘privacy policy’ for Samsung’s Internet-connected SmartTV advises users that its nifty voice command feature might capture more than just your request to play the latest episode of Downton Abbey. ‘Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party,’ the policy reads.” The Daily Beast reported that the company’s goal appeared to be to “use a third-party service to convert speech to text” in an effort to improve Samsung’s voice recognition feature. But the privacy policy appeared to be overly broad. For its part, Samsung said the privacy policy, and its voice recognition technology, had been misunderstood. The company updated its privacy policy and explained the technology in plain terms: “Some Samsung Smart TVs offer voice recognitions functions. These functions are enabled only when users agree to the separate Samsung Privacy Policy and Terms of Use regarding this function when initially setting up the TV. Apart from initial setup, users are given the choice to activate or deactivate the voice recognition feature at any time. Voice recognition takes place in two ways: The first is through an embedded microphone inside the TV set that responds to simple predetermined TV commands such as changing the channel and increasing the volume. Voice data is neither stored nor transmitted in using these predetermined commands. The second microphone, which is inside the remote control, requires interaction with a server because it is used for searching content. A user, for example, can speak into the remote control requesting the search of particular TV programs (ex: “Recommend a good Sci-Fi movie”). This interaction works like most any other voice recognition service available on other products including smartphones and tablets.” So, a microphone inside the television may “listen” for predetermined keywords to complete commands like changing the channel or adjusting the volume — but it doesn’t record conversations. The updated privacy policy states that a second microphone inside the remote control will record and transmit conversations only when the “activation” button is pressed. The policy reads: “To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the voice recognition features to you. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with voice recognition features and evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.” So, it’s true that Samsung smart TVs — and other brands of TVs with voice recognition — listen to and record user voices, but the claim that they “secretly” listen in is misleading. Still, users who are still leery of the technology can always disable the voice activation feature entirely. Click here for step-by-step directions. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Scott Walker was not kicked out of Marquette University for cheating, and the claim that he had a 2.3 GPA is unproven. The two-term Republican governor and presidential hopeful left Marquette University during his senior year and never earned a degree. In a 2011 interview , Scott Walker said, “Certainly I wanted an education for more than just a job, but my primary purpose was to get a job, and so I left school before finishing my senior year.” Marquette University released two statements (with Scott Walker’s approval) in 2013 that back up Walker’s account of leaving college early, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports : “Gov. Scott Walker was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew from Marquette.” “Governor Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette University and when he left Marquette University. Governor Walker was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time.” And the claim that Scott Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he left school can’t be proven. School records are not public record, and Scott Walker has never released his college transcripts. During a run for governor in 2010, however, Scott Walker’s campaign said that he had earned 94 credits and accumulated a 2.59 GPA in college. The debate about Scott Walker’s college education started when he campaigned for governor in 2010. Then, in December of 2013, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that Walker had been “kicked out” of Marquette University for violating student election rules. The group later rolled back that claim and said , “Walker has proffered a number of conflicting explanations, including the unbelievable explanation that a job offer — not bad grades or worse — was what led him to not finish his pricey degree.” The “cheating” claim often relates to Scott Walker’s bid to become student body president at Marquette University in 1988, but there’s no evidence that he left college early because of it. The Marquette Tribune reported in February of 1988 that: “Potential ASMU presidential candidate Scott Walker was found guilty of illegal campaigning in a grievance hearing before members of the elections commission Monday night. ‘By speaking before a meeting of the Delta Chi fraternity Jan. 24, Walker, an arts and sciences sophomore, violated the rule which states, ‘No campaigning may begin before a candidate is registered,’ the committee ruled.’ “The election rules say candidates for president may not register until Feb. 3.” Then, Marquette University administrators investigated the “mass theft” of Marquette Tribune newspapers after its editors endorsed Scott Walker’s opponent in the race, which has fueled even more speculation. But the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that details of that investigation were sealed, and Scott Walker denied any involvement with the stolen papers. It should also be noted that Walker remained at Marquette University for a number of years after his failed election attempt. In February of 2015, claims about Scott Walker’s college days once again went viral on social media after the governor released a budget plan that called for a $300 million funding cut for the University of Wisconsin System. One viral social media post states: “Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he’s attacking teachers now?” The post repeats earlier claims about Scott Walker that are untrue or unproven. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Sharia Law Declared in Dearborn, Michigan – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sharia-law-declared-in-dearborn-michigan/"," Dearborn, Michigan, has become the first city to fully implement Sharia Law. "," This false claim was started by a fake news website. An article published by the National Report said the city council in Dearborn, a city just west of Detroit, voted to implement all aspects of Sharia Law. According to the report: The new law could see citizens stoned for adultery or having a limb  amputated for theft. Lesser offenses, such as drinking alcohol or  abortion, could result in flogging and/or caning. In addition,  the law imposes harsh laws with regards to women and allows for  child marriage. Some in town seem to welcome the new legislation while others have  denounced the move as “abhorrent”, a threat to freedom and  incompatible with the Constitution.  When asked by National Report  about the need for such a law, local resident Jeremy Ahmed  stated: “It is because of our need that Allah the Almighty, in all  his generosity, has created laws for us, so that we can utilize them  to obtain justice. We hope to see other cities taking this action in  the face of the governments inaction of passing such legislation.” The story was quickly liked and shared on Facebook more than 200,000 times. But the National Report prides itself on a “gentle” form of satire that “parodies real news in a way that seems almost designed with the specific goal of tricking its readers,” according to its disclaimer . Dearborn wasn’t chosen at random for this National Report spoof. The city has one of the largest Muslim populations outside the Middle East in the world. Just fewer than 100,000 people live in Dearborn, and about 40,000 of them are Arab Americans.

"Photo Shows Weasel Riding on Woodpecker – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/photo-shows-weasel-riding-on-woodpecker/"," A photo shows a weasel riding on the back of a woodpecker in flight. "," The photo of a weasel riding on the back of a flying woodpecker appears to be real. Amateur photographer Martin Le-May said he was bird watching at a park in Essex, England, when he heard the screech of a bird in distress, Reuters reports : “I picked my camera up, the bird flew off, and flew toward us. I snapped and took a couple photographs and realized, as I was doing that, there was something on the back of the woodpecker,” Martin le-May said. The photo went viral on Twitter just hours after Martin Le-May posted it. Thousands of users commented on the photo with the hashtag #weaselpecker . The bird in question is a European green woodpecker . The species can weigh up to 8 ounces, and its wingspan can measure up to 16 inches, so it’s a pretty large bird. The green woodpecker feeds on insects like ants, beetles and caterpillars — which is probably what the bird in the photo was doing when he was attacked by a least weasel that latched onto its back. Known as a small but fierce carnivore, the least weasel preys on birds, rabbits and frogs. It eats 40-60% of its bodyweight each day. The photo doesn’t appear to be doctored, either. Henry Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, said he saw no evidence that the photo was not real, National Geographic reports : “’’This would have required a nearly perfect and coincidental alignment of the two animals in their original photos so that they could be composited together,” said Farid. “This type of forgery is therefore more difficult to create than, for example, two animals simply standing side-by-side.’ There were also multiple photos of the scene, which would be nearly impossible to replicate, Farid said, There also weren’t any lighting, color, focus or quality differences between the weasel and the bird. And there’s good news: the green woodpecker successfully evaded the weasel’s attack and lived to see another day, Le-May said : “’The woodpecker landed in front of us and I feared the worst. I guess our presence; maybe 25 meters away, momentarily distracted the weasel. The woodpecker seized the opportunity and flew up and away into some bushes away to our left. Quickly the bird gathered its self respect and flew up into the trees and away from our sight. The woodpecker left with its life, the weasel just disappeared into the long grass, hungry.’” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Pope Francis: All Dogs Go to Heaven – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pope-francis-all-dogs-go-to-heaven/"," Pope Francis told a young boy grieving the death of his dog that he would see his pet again in heaven. "," Despite widespread media coverage to the contrary, Pope Francis didn’t comfort a grieving boy or promise that his dog would go to heaven. It was Pope Paul VI who told a young boy in the ‘70s that he would be reunited with his dog in heaven, a Vatican spokesperson told Reuters: “The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago. Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ‘one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.’ ‘There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,’ the Vatican’s deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said when asked about how the media ran with the story.” It appears that the confusion started after the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera covered Pope Francis’s weekly address at St. Peters Square on November 26, 2014. The address focused on the apocalypse and a “new heaven” and “new earth” that would follow. In response to the place of animals in the so-called new heaven and new earth, the paper reported : “Certainly the issue is recurring and sometimes controversial, in the Church. It is said that Paul VI had comforted a child in tears for the death of his dog and said: “One day we will review our animals in the Eternity of Christ.” An Italian version of the Huffington Post then picked up the story and confused Pope Paul VI with the apostle Paul: “Pope Francis opens the prospect of paradise for animals and does it in a general audience dedicated to the theme of life and death. In this regard, the Pope quoted the Apostle Paul that to a child in tears for the death of his dog had answered: ‘One day we will review our animals in the eternity of Christ.’” By the time English-language newspapers like the Express picked up the story, the headline had changed to, “’All donkeys go to heaven’ Pope says the Kingdom of Heaven is open to ALL God’s creatures.” The Express reported : “In his weekly audience in St Peter’s Francis quoted the apostle Paul who comforted a child who was crying after his dog died. ‘One day we will see our animals again in eternity of Christ’, Francis quoted Paul as saying. The Pope added: “Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.’ His position is markedly different from that of Pope Benedict XVI said that the other animals ‘are not called to the eternal life.’” The eRumor flew to new heights when American media picked up the story. By then, it was widely reported that Pope Francis had himself comforted the little boy who was grieving his dog’s death. The New York Times published a version of that false account and issued a lengthy correction on December 16, 2014: “An article on Friday about whether Pope Francis believes that animals go to heaven — a longstanding theological question in the church — misstated the pope’s recent remarks and the circumstances in which they were made. He spoke in a general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26, not in consoling a distraught boy whose dog had died. According to Vatican Radio, Francis said, in speaking of heaven, ‘The Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us.’ He did not say: ‘One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.’ Those remarks are reported to have been made by Pope Paul VI to a distraught child.” This eRumor wasn’t intended to mislead or dupe readers. It’s a perfect example of how a factual account can transform over time (and through multiple translations) until it loses its original meaning. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Pope Francis Says Atheists Go to Heaven – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pope-francis-says-atheists-go-to-heaven/"," Pope Francis said the traditional notion of God is outdated and it’s not necessary to believe in god to be a good person. "," There’s no record of Pope Francis saying that the church is outdated, or that you don’t have to believe in god to be a good person. The eRumor surfaced on Facebook in early December of 2014 when hundreds of thousands of users “liked” and “shared” an alleged quote from Pope Francis: “It is not necessary to believe in God to be a good person. In a way, the traditional notion of God is outdated. One can be spiritual but not religious. It is not necessary to go to church and give money — for many, nature can be a church. Some of the best people in history do not believe in God, while some of the worst deeds were done in His name.” The post doesn’t cite a source, and it doesn’t appear to be a direct quote from any prominent religious or public figure. It does, however, loosely reflect remarks that Pope Francis made about atheists being redeemed during a homily in May of 2013: “The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! ‘Father, the atheists?’ Even the atheists. Everyone! And this Blood makes us children of God of the first class. We are created children in the likeness of God and the Blood of Christ has redeemed us all. And we all have a duty to do good. And this commandment for everyone to do good, I think, is a beautiful path towards peace. If we, each doing our own part, if we do good to others, if we meet there, doing good, and we go slowly, gently, little by little, we will make that culture of encounter: We need that so much. We must meet one another doing good. ‘But I don’t believe, Father, I am an atheist!’ But do good: We will meet one another there.” Reports of Pope Francis’s homily went viral, and Vatican representatives quickly said his original meaning had been lost in translation. Fr. Thomas Rosica, a Vatican representative, explained : “This means that all salvation comes from Christ, the Head, through the Church which is his body. Hence they cannot be saved who, knowing the Church as founded by Christ and necessary for salvation, would refuse to enter her or remain in her. At the same time, thanks to Christ and to his Church, those who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ and his Church but sincerely seek God and, moved by grace, try to do his will as it is known through the dictates of conscience can attain eternal salvation.” The eRumor also borrows a subtext about religion vs. spiritualism and the idea of the church being “outdated” from comments made by Pope Francis’s niece, Cristina Bergoglio, in July of 2014, WPLG-Miami reports : “There’s a new art exhibit in Miami in an unlikely place and by an unlikely artist. Pope Francis’ niece and artist Cristina Bergoglio has her works on display at the Conrad Hotel in Brickell. Bergoglio said she is not religious, but spiritual and she doesn’t subscribe to any one religion. ‘I’m not afraid to say I see the church as outdated, and that’s why I believe life has put my uncle to renew this certain system of thought that was getting stagnated,’ said Bergoglio.” The original author of the eRumor isn’t known, but its text blends previous statements that have proven controversial in an apparent attempt to start a dialogue about spiritualism, or to incite those who practice Catholicism.

A marketing video that was shared more than 36,000 times on Facebook features testimonials from so-called satisfied customers, and it promises perfect vision using just a few “simple, easy, soothing and fun” exercises. Like many “miraculous” online health claims, however, marketers of the Quantum Vision System never explain exactly what it is, or how it can produce such incredible results.

"President Obama Threatened to Shoot Down Israeli Planes-Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-threatened-to-shoot-down-israeli-planes/"," President Obama threatened to shoot down Israeli planes if they were deployed to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities in 2014. "," Reports that President Obama threatened to shoot down Israeli planes if they were launched to attack Iran are unproven. The claim went viral days before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Capitol Hill to urge U.S. lawmakers to oppose a nuclear deal with Iran that the Obama administration had been brokering. The rumor quickly went viral after the Israel-based Ma’an News Agency cited a report by Al-Jarida, a newspaper based in Kuwait, that President Obama had threatened to shoot down Israeli planes: “Al-Jarida newspaper quoted “well-placed” sources as saying that  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had taken a decision to  carry out airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear program after  consultations with his minister of defense Moshe Yaalon and foreign  minister Avigdor Liberman in the presence of top security  commanders. “The decision came, according to al-Jarida, after Israel revealed  that the United States and Iran had been involved in secret talks  over Iran’s nuclear program and were about to sign an agreement in  that regard behind Israel’s back. “According to the report, Netanyahu and his commanders agreed after  four nights of deliberations to task the Israeli army’s chief of  staff Beni Gants to prepare a qualitative operation against Iran’s  nuclear program. In addition, Netanyahu and his ministers decided to  do whatever they could do to thwart a possible agreement between  Iran and the White House because such an agreement is, allegedly, a  threat to Israel’s security.” According to the Al-Jarida report, an Israeli official tipped of Secretary of State John Kerry, and President Obama threatened to shoot down the Israeli planes. Al-Jarida did not name the source for the inside information. The White House issued a statement that said, “That report is totally false.” An Israeli official may have tipped off Kerry about a specific plan, but the potential for Israel to launch a preemptive attack against Iran wasn’t a secret at the time. Israeli officials have publicly threatened to strike Iran for years, the Jerusalem Post reports : “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened the use of force  against Iran several times since 2009, even seeking authorization  from his cabinet in 2011. Iran’s program has since grown in size  and scope. “According to his aides, the prime minister’s preference is not war,  but the continuation of a tight sanctions regime on Iran’s economy  coupled with a credible threat of military force. Netanyahu believes  more time under duress would have led to an acceptable deal. But  that opportunity, in his mind, may now be lost.” Another report by the Atlantic in October of 2014 said the U.S. once feared Israel’s threats to attack Iran, but that the threats were no longer taken seriously: “…The fear inside the White House of a preemptive attack (or  preventative attack, to put it more accurately) was real and  palpable — as was the fear of dissenters inside Netanyahu’s  Cabinet, and at Israel Defense Forces headquarters. At U.S. Central  Command headquarters in Tampa, analysts kept careful track of  weather patterns and of the waxing and waning moon over Iran, trying  to predict the exact night of the coming Israeli attack. “Today, there are few such fears. “The feeling now is that Bibi’s  bluffing,” this second official said. “He’s not Begin at Osirak,”  the official added, referring to the successful 1981 Israeli  Air Force raid ordered by the ex-prime minister on Iraq’s nuclear  reactor. “The belief that Netanyahu’s threat to strike is now an empty one  has given U.S. officials room to breathe in their ongoing  negotiations with Iran.” In the end, there’s no way to tell whether the original Al-Jarid report is credible because the newspaper does not name a source. That unnamed source is the basis for the entire eRumor. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"President Obama’s Claims about Prisoner Swaps by Washington, Lincoln and FDR– Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obamas-claims-about-prisoner-swaps-by-washington-lincoln-and-fdr/"," President Obama falsely claimed that George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in post-war prisoner swaps similar to the one that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. "," President Obama was right in saying that George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt all negotiated prisoner swaps during combat situations while they were in office. But the president was wrong in saying that all three former presidents negotiated prisoner swaps “at the end of wars” because Washington, Lincoln and FDR all negotiated prisoner swaps during wars. Obama made the statement during a June 4, 2014, joint press conference in Poland. According to an official White House transcript , a reporter asked the president about a prisoner swap that led to the release of Bowe Bergdahl, who had been captured by the Taliban, and Obama responded, in part: “The United States has always had a pretty sacred rule, and that is  we don’t leave our men or women in uniform behind. And that dates  back to the earliest days of our revolution…. “…But this is what happens at the end of wars. That was true for  George Washington; that was true for Abraham Lincoln; that was true  for FDR; that’s been true of every combat situation — that at some  point, you make sure that you try to get your folks back. And that’s  the right thing to do.” A chain email that has made the rounds on the Internet claims that Obama’s remarks about Washington, Lincoln and FDR are historically inaccurate: “George Washington did not become president until six years after  the Revolutionary War ended in 1783.  By 1789 there were no longer  any prisoners for him to exchange. “Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in mid April of 1865. The Civil  War ended the following month. He was still dead at that time. No  deals were made to exchange prisoners after the war. All prisoners  were simply freed. “FDR died of a stroke before the end of WWII. Like Lincoln, he  stayed dead after the war so he couldn’t do what this jerk says he  did.” Although the email recounts accurate historical facts about Washington, Lincoln and FDR — it gets details of prisoner swaps that they negotiated during wars wrong. First, let’s take a look at George Washington. He wasn’t elected president of the United States until 1789, which was six years after the Revolutionary War ended, as the email claims. But toward the end of the war, Washington was forced to negotiate prisoner swaps as the commander in chief of the Continental Army, according to the Mount Vernon Research Collection : “By July 1779, the Continental Congress ordered that British naval  prisoners were to be imprisoned on ships in the same manner as the  Americans in New York. No compromise on the fair treatment of  prisoners was ever reached. “With few facilities to accommodate large numbers of prisoners, both  the Americans and the British participated in prisoner exchange.  Though Washington was actively involved in these matters, he  appointed commissaries to handle the day-to-day details. The  exchange of prisoners during the American Revolution was a chaotic  ordeal, mainly because there was never a consistent policy put in  place by the Continental Congress. Subsequently, a cartel (a formal  agreement on prisoner exchange) was never put in place between the  British and the Americans.” Holding prisoners in a humane way was bankrupting Congress to the point that Washington “was compelled to personally subsidize the cost of prisoner upkeep” by 1781, according to the Mount Vernon Research Collection . Still, considering the historical differences, Washington’s prisoner swaps had little to do with the prisoner swap involving Bowe Bergdahl. The email also claims that Abraham Lincoln didn’t participate in prisoner swaps because he was assassinated a month before the Civil War ended and prisoners were freed, which is false. General Robert E. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865, which effectively ended the Civil War. Lincoln was assassinated days later on April 14, 1865. But the timing of Lincoln’s assassination is irrelevant because prisoners were often released within days of their capture during the Civil War, according to the Historical Dictionary of the Civil War : “When the Civil War began, neither side anticipated the large number  of prisoners that would be captured. As a result, no special steps  were taken to construct prisons for long periods of internment, and  opposing commanders were forced to exchange and parole prisoners  informally. However, as the number of prisoners began to overwhelm  both armies, a more formal agreement had to be made. “In July 1862, John A. Dix and Daniel H. Hill, generals in the Union  and Confederate armies, respectively, worked out the Dix-Hill  Cartel, a formal agreement on how to handle prisoners. They were to  be paroled within 10 days of capture (although in reality it  sometimes took longer) and exchanged according to a strict formula.  Equal ranks would be exchanged on a one-for-one basis, two privates  for one sergeant, 60 privates for one general, and so on.” That agreement temporarily fell apart when Lincoln learned that black Union soldiers were being treated differently than white ones. That led to the rise of Civil War prison camps like Andersonville , but an agreement was reached to resume prisoner swaps in January of 1865 — four months before Lincoln’s death. Like Washington, Lincoln was forced to negotiate prisoner swaps because there weren’t enough prisons to hold them, and the cost would have drained the Union’s war effort. The email also claims that FDR didn’t engage in prisoner swaps because he died before the end of World War II. It’s true that FDR died before the end of the war, but, like Washington and Lincoln, FDR engaged in prisoner exchanges during war. After Pearl Harbor was bombed, FDR signed Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526 and 2527 to authorize the detention of aliens who had emigrated to the U.S. from enemy countries. Some of them were forced to repatriate to their home countries, according to the National Archives . A lesser-known side of FDR’s policy was that some of those aliens were sent to their home countries in exchange for American soldiers that were captured by Japan and Germany. One internment camp in Texas called Crystal City was reportedly a hub for prisoner swaps, the Chicago Tribune reports : “One little-reported aspect of U.S. war policy that (author Jan  Jarboe Russell) describes in emotional detail is that Crystal City  was a hub for prisoner exchanges. Families would be ‘repatriated’ —  and not of their choosing — to Japan or Germany in exchange for  Americans that the Japanese and Germans were holding. Many children  at Crystal City, who were born in the United States and  were American citizens in every imaginable sense, were parceled off  to war-ravaged Japan and Germany in these exchanges.” Even though Obama’s claims about prisoner swaps negotiated by Washington, Lincoln and FDR are technically accurate, there aren’t many parallels between those prisoner swaps and the one that freed Bowe Bergdahl.

"President Obama’s Policies Will Establish a Country Within a Country for Illegal Immigrants-Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obamas-policies-will-establish-a-country-within-a-country-for-illegal-immigrants/"," President Obama plans to establish a country within a country where 13 to 15 million illegal immigrants would be allowed to live. "," Reports that President Obama’s policies would lead to a country within a country are based on speculation about the impact of two different federal actions. And speculation can’t be proven right or wrong, so this claim remains unresolved. Still, taking a closer look at the stated purposes and details of those federal actions may be helpful. The two main ingredients of this eRumor are a rule proposed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in July of 2013, and a presidential memorandum issued in November of 2014. On November 20, 2014, President Obama announced a series of executive actions to “crack down on illegal immigration at the border, prioritize deporting felons not families, and require certain undocumented immigrants to pass a criminal background check and pay taxes in order to temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation.” Then, on November 21, 2014, Obama signed a memorandum that created the White House Task Force on New Americans. That memorandum is one of the key components of this eRumor. The stated purpose of the task force is to support local efforts to “fully integrate” new immigrants, Obama explained in an official statement : “I am establishing a White House Task Force on New Americans, an  interagency effort to identify and support State and local efforts  at integration that are working and to consider how to expand and  replicate successful models. The Task Force, which will engage with  community, business, and faith leaders, as well as State and local  elected officials, will help determine additional steps the federal  government can take to ensure its programs and policies are serving  diverse communities that include new Americans.” The president said the task force would focus on efforts to improve civic, economic and linguistic integration of new Americans. At the time the eRumor went viral, the task force had not yet submitted any specific recommendations to accomplish this. The committee was scheduled to deliver recommendations to the president in March of 2015. The second ingredient of the eRumor is the Affirmatively Further Fair Housing (AFFH ) rule that was proposed by HUD in July of 2013. The stated purpose of the rule was to improve the Fair Housing Act’s “obligation for state and local governments to improve and achieve more meaningful outcomes from fair housing policies.” HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said the rule would, “provide data for every neighborhood in the country, detailing the access African-American, Latino, Asian and other communities have to assets.” Claims that the proposed rule would give rise to a country within a country began to circulate the web in February of 2015 after an Independent Sentinel report was picked up by a number of websites and blogs: “The rule would give the government the power to redistribute  illegal immigrants, drug addicts, criminals, everyone who fits into  a ‘protected class’ according to the government’s definition  throughout every neighborhood in the country and do it according to  racial quotas. “The rule ties government zoning rules to HUD grants and it opens  communities up to lawsuits if they refuse their quota. “It transforms neutral policies and actions into racism.” But a summary of the HUD rule states that local governments wouldn’t be required to take any action based on community data supplied under the rule: “However, the concrete actions of a local government that would  generate benefits for protected classes are not prescribed,  obligated, or enforced by the proposed rule. Instead, the rule  encourages a more engaged and data-driven approach to assess the  state of fair housing and planning actions to affirmatively further  fair housing.” The proposed rule had not yet taken effect when the eRumor went viral, and its fate was uncertain. A legal challenge held up its implementation, and the outcome of the judicial process wasn’t known. So, in summary, the stated purposes of the federal actions were to help integrate lower-income citizens and immigrants into communities. But the Independent Sentinel story theorized that the federal actions would have the opposite effect because citizens would be “pushed into the shadows as the ‘new Americans’ come out of the shadows.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"The Power Innovator Program Can Cut Energy Bills by 80% – Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:38:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-power-innovator-program-can-cut-energy-bills-by-80-percent/"," The Power Innovator Program uses a forgotten invention by Nikola Tesla to cut energy bills by more than 80%. "," The Power Innovator Program doesn’t provide specific information about how it can cut energy bills by 80%, so it’s not possible to prove whether the claim is true or false. Advertisements and promotional videos for the Power Innovator Program have flooded the Internet. Promotional videos like this one discuss the supposed benefits of the Power Innovator Program without explaining what it does, or how it cuts energy costs. A transcript of the video reads: “Once you have the Power Innovator Program installed in your home, you’ll immediately be able to save 80% on electricity by tomorrow. Some people even reported 90% without spending months and trying to build solar panels, wind turbines or spending thousands of dollars. “You can take this little device with you. It’s so small that it fits in your bag, even your pocket. It doesn’t need to be recharged. It works everywhere, even if it rains on it. You’ll be able to power any kind of household appliances from lamps and toasters to AC units for pennies on the dollar, anytime anywhere.” People who view advertisements and videos for the Power Innovator Program are directed to a website where they are asked to pay $49 for a booklet and CD that supposedly serves as an instruction manual to create a device that was invented by Nikola Tesla in the 1800s. The website doesn’t provide specifics about the device, but it’s supposedly based on a patent on a coil for electro-magnets that was awarded to Nikola Tesla in 1894. Tesla explained the invention in his patent: “In electric apparatus or systems in, which alternating currents are employed the self-induction of the coils or conductors may, and, in fact, in many cases does operate disadvantageously by giving rise to false currents which often reduce what is known as the commercial efficiency of the apparatus composing the system or operate detrimentally in other respects. The effects of self-induction, above referred to, are known to be neutralized by proportioning to a proper degree the capacity of the circuit with relation to the self-induction and frequency of the currents. This has been accomplished heretofore by the use of condensers constructed and applied as separate instruments. “My present invention has for its object to avoid the employment of condensers, which are expensive, cumbersome and difficult to maintain in perfect condition, and to so construct the coils themselves as to accomplish the same ultimate object.” Electrical condensers are used to store an electric charge.

"Obama Agrees to Resettle 70,000 Muslim Refugees – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-agrees-to-resettle-70k-muslim-refugees/"," President Obama has agreed to resettle 70,000 Muslim refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. President Obama has awarded Social Security numbers to 5 million illegal aliens. "," Both of these claims are false. The first claim, that President Obama had “silently agreed” to resettle 70,000 Muslim refugees, first appeared in forwarded emails in December of 2014. Another version of the eRumor claimed that Obama had agreed to resettle 70,000 refugees from Syria alone. Those claims appear to stem from a misinterpretation of a United Nations Resettlement Program handbook that was issued in November of 2014. The handbook states that the U.S. planned to resettle 70,000 total refugees from 2014 to 2015 — but the vast majority of them were not from predominately Muslim countries. According to the handbook , about 33,000 of the refugees were expected to come from countries in Southeast Asia like Burma, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippians. About 17,000 refugees were expected to come from Africa, and about 13,000 were expected to come from countries in East Asia like China, Japan and the Koreas. And President Obama also can’t “silently agree” to resettle refugees, as the eRumor claims. Congress must approve resettlements under the Immigration and Nationality Act . President Obama delivered a report to Congress on his proposed resettlements for fiscal year 2015 in September of 2014. The report describes recent and future resettlement plans for Syrian refugees: “While the vast majority of Syrians would prefer to return home when  the conflict ends, we recognize that some remain extremely  vulnerable in their country of asylum and would benefit  from resettlement. UNHCR has announced that it aims to refer 30,000  Syrian refugees to all resettlement countries by the end of calendar  year 2014. Those numbers will likely rise in 2015 and 2016.  The United States has received more than 2,500 referrals as of  August 2014 and expects thousands more in the remainder of the year.  We will begin to welcome those Syrians who are approved for U.S.  resettlement to communities across the country in larger numbers in  2015.” So, while America does resettle a number of refugees from countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Iran each year, the claim that 70,000 Muslim refugees would be resettled in 2015 is false. The eRumor’s second claim, that President Obama had issued social security numbers to 5 million illegal aliens, is also false. In November of 2014, President Obama announced that he would take executive action to offer temporary legal status to 5 million illegal aliens. Under the temporary legal status, aliens would receive work permits — but not Social Security numbers, as the eRumor claims. The Washington Post reports that Obama said aliens who come forward, register and submit to background checks would be granted three-year work permits: “I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well,  it’s not,” Obama said. “Amnesty is the immigration system we have  today — millions of people who live here without paying their taxes  or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare  people and whip up votes at election time.” Obama also called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his remarks.

"“Muslim Mob” Destroys British War Cemetery in Libya – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslim-mob-destroys-british-war-cemetery-in-libya/"," A video allegedly shows a Muslim mob of men destroying a cemetery in Libya where British war veterans are buried. "," This claim is true. A video that was posted on YouTube in March of 2012 shows a group of men, some holding rifles, kicking over headstones at a cemetery. A Jewish Star of David can be seen etched on one of the headstones, and a number of men attempt to smash a tall concrete cross with sledgehammers in the video. A caption posted with the video roughly translated from Italian reads, “Rebels (NATO mercenaries) destroy a cemetery in Libya. NATO-al Qaeda rebels destroy Christian and Jewish graves.” The video was shot at Benghazi War Cemetery in the Libyan city of Benghazi. More than 1,200 Commonwealth troops who died in World War II battles in North Africa are buried there. In all, the vandals damaged about 200 headstones at the Benghazi War Cemetery. The vandals then moved on to a second cemetery, the nearby Benghazi British Military Cemetery, and damaged about a quarter of the graves there, Al Jazeera reported in 2012: “The National Transitional Council (Libya’s interim leadership after Muammar Gaddafi was forced out) has close ties with Western countries after a NATO bombing campaign helped it to topple the government of Muammar Gaddafi. However, a minority of hardline Islamists, who are opposed to any non-Muslim presence and in some cases have formed into heavily-armed groups, have gained ground since Gaddafi’s 42-year rule ended last August. The government in Tripoli has struggled to assert its authority over these groups. Salafists, followers of an ultra-purist interpretation of Islam, have already destroyed several tombs of Muslim holy men in Libya, which they consider to be idolatrous.” The National Transitional Council denounced the vandals and said in a statement that their actions were not “keeping with Islam.” By April of 2012, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said that new headstones were on order to replace the damaged ones. The group also said that both cemeteries had been “tidied up” after the attacks: “All the broken headstones have been removed from the Benghazi War Cemetery and the Benghazi British Military Cemetery, and temporary markers have been erected on all the graves that were damaged in the attacks last month. The cemeteries have been tidied throughout, and — in the words of Commonwealth War Graves Commission staff who’ve returned from Libya — the site looks ‘presentable’ again. The cemeteries are “dry” sites, so there is no grass to maintain. But CWGC staff have already removed weeds and tidied around the graves. The situation across Libya remains unpredictable, and the Foreign Office continues to advise against all but essential travel in the Benghazi area. But local CWGC staff are able to work again and their next task is to remove the remnants of the Cross of Sacrifice which was damaged in the attack on the Benghazi War Cemetery. New headstones are on order, and will be manufactured and shipped over the coming months.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Nancy Pelosi’s Jet is Gone – Truth! & Outdated!","2015-03-17 20:38:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nancy-pelosi-jet-is-gone/"," Congresswoman and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can no longer use an Air Force jet to travel from Washington to California. "," This eRumor’s claims about Nancy Pelosi’s use of Air Force planes are true, misleading and outdated. Nancy Pelosi sometimes flew on Air Force planes while she served as House Speaker — but she hasn’t held that position since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010. And the eRumor’s claims about the cost of Pelosi’s air travel to U.S. taxpayers are correct, according to public records obtained by the non-profit Judicial Watch in 2009 and 2010 : “The Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force  $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for  in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol.” However, the eRumor’s insinuation that Pelosi had requested or demanded to use Air Force planes is misleading. Former House Sergeant at Arms Bill Livingood said in 2007 that Pelosi didn’t make the request, but that he did for security reasons: “The fact that Speaker Pelosi lives in California compelled me to  request an aircraft that is capable of making non-stop flights for  security purposes, unless such an aircraft is unavailable.” The Bush Administration also stood behind Pelosi at the time. Former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow told CNN: “We think it’s appropriate. And so, again, I think this is much ado  about not a whole lot. It is important for the Speaker to have this  kind of protection and travel.” At the time, Pelosi said that she preferred to fly commercial but wasn’t allowed to because of security concerns. “I told them that I will travel across the country non-stop,  commercially, as I have done and have done probably 1,000 times  since I’ve been in Congress, so this is nothing new to me.” Ohio Republican Rep. John Boehner was allowed to forgo military transport after he was elected House Speaker in 2010. In a statement , the House Sergeant at Arms said Boehner would be allowed to fly commercial based on “the current security assessment.” TruthorFiction.com covered an earlier version of this eRumor.

"More People Are on Welfare Than Are Employed in 11 States – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/more-people-are-on-welfare-than-are-employed-in-11-states/"," A new welfare map that has been titled “Death Spiral” claims that there are now 11 states that have more people on welfare than employed. The eRumor also claims that the federal government pays an average of $168 a day in benefits to households that are below the poverty line. "," It’s not true that more people are on welfare than are employed in 11 states. The rumor appeared in chain emails in late 2014 and early 2015 under the subject line “New Welfare Map.” The map falsely identified 11 states — California , New Mexico , Illinois , MIssissippi , Kentucky , Alabama , Ohio , New York , Hawaii , South Carolina and Maine — as the ones in which more people are on welfare than have jobs. But a quick glance at Bureau of Labor Statistics data on each state’s workforce reveals that none of the states are even close to having more people on welfare than working. Mississippi registered a 7.2% unemployment rate in February of 2015, which was among the worst of the 11 states identified in the email. Still, there were about 1.24 million people in Mississippi’s labor force, and just 89,000 of them were unemployed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports . The chain email also claimed that households living below the poverty line receive an average of $168 in government support each day, which was true in fiscal year 2012. A report by the Senate Budget Committee said that figure includes food stamps, housing support, childcare, Medicaid and other benefits: “Based on data from the Congressional Research Service, cumulative spending on means-tested federal welfare programs, if converted into cash, would equal $167.65 per day per household living below the poverty level. By comparison, the median household income in 2011 of $50,054 equals $137.13 per day. Additionally, spending on federal welfare benefits, if converted into cash payments, equals enough to provide $30.60 per hour, 40 hours per week, to each household living below poverty. The median household hourly wage is $25.03. After accounting for federal taxes, the median hourly wage drops to between $21.50 and $23.45, depending on a household’s deductions and filing status. State and local taxes further reduce the median household’s hourly earnings. By contrast, welfare benefits are not taxed. It’s not true that more people collect unemployment than work in 11 states, but it is true that the federal government spent an average of $168 per day on households that are below the poverty line in fiscal year 2012.

The country began to slip into civil war in 2011 and the violence had escalated quickly by mid-2012. NBC News reports : “No one knows who did this. These Syrians want rid of their  president, and someone wants rid of them. Carnage is appalling with  scenes we cannot show. This is in the capitol, not even a funeral is  safe here. Syria is slipping into an abyss.” A Facebook user later posted the video with a caption that claimed the dozens of mourners who were killed were candidates for the 2015 Darwin Awards , which “commemorates those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it.” A caption posted with the video reads: “A suicide bomber was shot dead by Israeli forces. Muslims took up  his body and started protesting. These Darwin Award candidates did  not know that the suicide belt was still tied to the bomber’s body  which they were carrying. You will want to watch what happens next.” The video itself proves that the claim is false.

That claim first surfaced in 2012 when a Facebook page went up for the so-called “Lucifer Our Lord = LOL” community. Even though there was only one post on the page, the “Lucifer our lord” myth was spread by social media users who posted versions of it, like this one : “LOL = LUCIFER OUR LORD. YOLO= YOUTH OBEYING LUCIFER’S ORDERS. SWAG = SATAN’S WISHES ARE GRANTED. ROFL = RISE, OUR FATHER LUCIFER. BRB = BEELZEBUB RULES BELOW. WTF= WORSHIP THE FALLEN.” LOL is short for “laughing out loud.” So many people use it in their text messages and tweets that it’s included in dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and Merriam-Webster now, the Huffington Post reports : “Online, “initialisms” as they call them, are faster to type (as in  texts and tweets) and, crucially, ‘help to say more in media where  there is a limit to a number of characters one may use in a  single message.’ “But the rise of these all-caps acronyms has impacted the  non-electronic world as well. Found ‘in print, and even in spoken  use’ the OED notes ‘there often seems to be a bit more than  simple abbreviation going on.’ “When you’re LOL-ing in real life, apparently your e-shorthand helps  you connote that you are using an ‘informal, gossipy mode of  expression’ or even going so far as to ‘parody the level of  unreflective enthusiasm or overstatement that can sometimes appear  in online discourse, while at the same time marking oneself as an  ‘insider’ au fait with the forms of expression associated with the  latest technology.’” Surprisingly, the OED dug even deeper into the history of LOL and found that it was used to shorten “laughing out loud” as early as 1989. Before that, LOL was used to abbreviate “ little old lady ” in the 1960s. There’s no record of Satanists using the term. The same goes for other texting shorthand. YOLO stands for “you only live once,” not “youth obeying Lucifer’s orders.” That eRumor surfaced in 2012 when a “Youth Obeying Lucifer’s Orders – YOLO” Facebook page went up. The page was made by a group of comedians who said their interest was, “Making you, the fans, laugh!” That means it shouldn’t be taken seriously. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," This claim is false. The eRumor started with a post on social media sites that claims Marco Polo wrote, “The militant Muslim is the person who beheads the infidel, while the moderate Muslim holds the feet of the victim.” Polo was a Venetian merchant who gained fame for writing about his travels in China, Central Asia and Persia in the 13th and 14th centuries. The idea that Polo would use the modern concepts “militant” and “moderate” Muslims in the middle ages is unlikely. The quote first appeared online in 2008 in a post headlined, “Great Thinkers on Islam.” It was attributed to a professor of philosophy named Dr. M. Sabieski. The quote has regularly appeared online since — but Dr. M. Sabieski hasn’t. There are no online records of a professor of philosophy by that name, so its authorship can’t be verified. But it should be noted that Polo did comment on followers of Islam in his book, “The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian.” On page 45 , Polo describes his experiences with the people of Tauris (modern day Crimea): The Mahometan inhabitants are treacherous and unprincipled. According to their doctrine, whatever is stolen or plundered from others of a different faith, is properly taken, and the theft is no crime; whilst those who suffer death or injury by the hands of Christians, are considered martyrs. If, therefore, they were not prohibited and restrained by the powers who now govern them, they would commit many outrages. These principals are common to all the Saracens. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Parts of this email are true, and parts of it are false. The email went viral as America marked the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, that was led by Martin Luther King Jr. Protestors marched from Selma to Montgomery to encourage black voters in the south to register to vote. The three-day march drew national attention to the struggle of black voters in the south, and the Voting Rights Act was passed a year later. This eRumor covers a lot of ground. It makes claims about Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement, the 1965 march in Selma, and comments made by President Obama. We’ll do our best to look at three of its key points separately. Martin Luther King Jr. Was a Republican – Fiction! Republicans and Democrats have both tried to claim Martin Luther King Jr. for years, but he never identified with either party. King never endorsed a political candidate, and he said in a 1958 interview : “I’m not here to tell you how to vote. That isn’t my concern. I’m  not a politician. I have no political ambitions. I don’t think the  Republican Party is a party full of the almighty God, nor is the  Democratic Party. They both have weaknesses. And I’m not  inextricably bound to either party. I’m not concerned about telling  you what party to vote for. But what I’m saying is this, that we  must gain the ballot and use it wisely.” The South Was Under the Power of the Democratic Party Before the Civil Rights Movement – Fiction! This claim is false. Prior to the civil rights movement, southern states are what today we call “swing states.” Sometimes they voted Democrat, sometimes Republican, and sometimes third party. Electoral maps from 1948 , 1952 , 1956 , 1960 , 1964 and 1968 prove this, so the south was not “maintained in power” by any one party, as the eRumor claims. No single political party can be blamed for racism and segregation in the 20th century because the issue crossed party lines. But the eRumor’s claim that Sheriff Jim Clark, who was known for the “Bloody Sunday” clashes with protestors in Selma, was elected to office on the Democratic ticket is true. Clark served two terms before he was voted out of office in the 1966 Democratic primary, the Washington Post reports President Obama Said the Selma March Led to His Birth – Truth! During his first presidential campaign in 2007, then-Senator Obama spoke at an event that commemorated the 42nd anniversary of the march in Selma and talked about how the civil rights movement had made his birth possible. Obama has been criticized for saying that the march in Selma made his birth possible because it was held in 1965, and he was born in 1961. According to a transcript of the speech, Obama said: “And what happened in Selma, Alabama and Birmingham also stirred the  conscience of a nation and it worried folks in the White House who  said, you know, we’re battling communism, how are we going to win  the hearts and minds all across the world if right here in our own  country, (President Kennedy), we’re not observing the ideals that  are set forth in our Constitution? “…The Kennedys decided, we’re going to do an airlift. We’re going to  go out to Africa. And we’re going to start bringing young Africans  over to this country and bring them scholarships to study so that  they can learn what a wonderful country America is. And this young  man named Barack Obama got one of those tickets and came over to  this country. “And he met this woman, whose great-, great-, great-,  great-grandfather had owned slaves, but she had a different idea.  There’s some good craziness going on because they looked at each  other and they decided, we know that in the world as it has been it  might not be possible for us to get together and have a child. “But something stirred across the country because of what happened  in Selma, Alabama, because some folks were willing to march across a  bridge. And so they got together, Barack Obama Jr. was born. “So don’t tell me I don’t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don’t tell  me I’m not coming home when I come to Selma, Alabama. I’m here  because somebody marched for our freedom. I’m here because y’all  sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the  Moses generation.” The president was wrong when he said the march in Selma led to his birth. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," It’s true that dimethylpolysiloxane is used in household silicon products and as a food ingredient by restaurants like McDonalds. But studies have shown that dimethylpolysiloxane (also called polymethylsiloxane) is safe for human consumption in limited amounts. Dimethylpolysiloxane is used as an anti-foaming agent that’s added to deep fried foods like French fries and chicken nuggets at restaurants like McDonald’s , Wendy’s , Taco Bell , KFC , Chick-fil-A and Five Guys . McDonald’s explained : “The oil we use for our fried menu items, like our chicken McNuggets,  world famous fries and crispy chicken sandwiches, does contain a  small amount of dimethylpolysiloxane. This is an FDA-approved  ingredient that helps prevent the splattering of oil as foods are  cooked.” The FDA last approved dimethylpolysiloxane as a food additive in 1998. The move was requested by the Dow Corning Corporation, which describes itself as a “global leader in silicon-based technology and innovation.” The FDA placed a number of limitations on the use of dimethylpolysiloxane as a “secondary direct food additive” for human consumption: “Limitations: 10 parts per million in food, or at such level in a  concentrated food that when prepared as directed on the labels, the  food in its ready-for-consumption state will have not more than 10  parts per million except as follows: Zero in milk; 110 parts per  million in dry gelatin dessert mixes labeled for use whereby no  more than 16 parts per million is present in the ready-to-serve  dessert; 250 parts per million in salt labeled for cooking purposes,  whereby no more than 10 parts per million is present in the cooked  food.” A number of health agencies have reviewed the use dimethylpolysiloxane as a food additive over the years, and those studies haven’t linked it to any harmful side effects. The European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals carried out a review in 2011 that found it had no adverse affect on the immune system and was “rapidly excreted unchanged in the feces” when ingested by humans. The World Health Organization also explored potential long-term consequences of dimethylpolysiloxane exposure in lab rats. It concluded : “Studies have been carried out on silicone fluids with and without  the addition of silica. The presence of silica did not raise any  toxicological problems nor did it affect the results of the  experiment in a significant way. Short-term studies have been  carried out in several species, including one study on an emulsion  of dimethylpolysiloxane. An adequate long-term study with  dimethylpolysiloxane has been carried out in the rat. None of these  studies has revealed any significant toxicity.” Dimethylpolysiloxane is also used as an inactive ingredient in over-the-counter drugs, lotions and hygiene products. It can be found in makeup, nail polish, contact lens solution, sunscreen, deodorant and shampoo. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," The lengthy essay that has made the rounds in many forwarded emails was in fact authored by Jan Morgan, the owner of the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Jan Morgan describes herself as a 2nd Amendment advocate, speaker, NRA Certified Firearms Instructor and an investigative journalist. She also operates the website Jan Morgan Media and published the “Muslim free zone” essay there in September of 2014: “To understand why I am have a problem with islamists, you must  first consider the nature of my business. This is not a coffee and donut shop. This is a live fire indoor  shooting range. People come here to buy, rent, and shoot lethal  weapons. In the range, people are shooting guns in close proximity to each  other, so my patrons depend on me and my discretion regarding who I  allow to shoot beside them. One mistake in judgment on my part could cost innocent people their  lives.” Jan Morgan then lists 10 reasons to explain her decision to ban Muslims from the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range. Some of the 10 reasons are general statements about Muslim people, but a number of the claims can be investigated more. One of Jan Morgan’s first claims is that the Quran contains “109 versus commanding hate, murder and terror against all human beings who submit or convert to Islam.” This claim has been repeated many times, and it remains disputed. Defenders of Islam say that those versus have been “cherry picked” or taken out of context for dramatic effect. The website The Religion of Peace, which is a self-described presenter of the “politically incorrect truth about Islam,” was among the first groups to make the 109 versus claim : “The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war  with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule.  Some are quite  graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill  infidels wherever they may be hiding.  Muslims who do not join the  fight are called ‘hypocrites’ and warned that Allah will send them  to Hell if they do not join the slaughter. Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the  verses of violence in the Quran are mostly open-ended, meaning that  they are not restrained by the historical context of the surrounding  text.  They are part of the eternal, unchanging word of Allah, and  just as relevant or subjective as anything else in the Quran.” However, people on the other side of the debate say the 109 “violent” passages from the Quran only appear to be open-ended because of the way they are presented. Philip Jenkins, a professor at Penn State University, said violence in the Quran is largely a defense against attack: “By the standards of the time, which is the 7th century A.D., the  laws of war that are laid down by the Quran are actually reasonably  humane,” he says. “Then we turn to the Bible, and we actually find  something that is for many people a real surprise. There is a  specific kind of warfare laid down in the Bible which we can only  call genocide.” Debates about specific passages in the Bible and the Quran will most likely never be resolved, so Jan Morgan’s claim about the 109 violent passages remains disputed. Another claim made by Jan Morgan was that Muslims killed 270 million people in Islam’s first 1,400 years of existence, which is also disputed. The claim seems to have first appeared in the online newsletter , “Tears of a Jihad.” The website said it provided a “rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.” Other variations of the claim say that 270 million people were killed by jihad over a 1,000-year period. Haroon Moghul, a fellow at New America Foundation, called the claim a myth in a column published by Al Jazeera: “I imagine (the claim) means the period from roughly 600 to 1600 AD,  which covers the time when Muslim states were generally not (as was  subsequently true) on the receiving end of colonial conquest. When Islam emerged in western Arabia, around 610 AD, the total  population of the world was likely between 300 and 400 million. Fast  forward to right past our period. The United Nations Census  Report suggests that the world’s total population in the year 1800  was 1 billion; since then, of course, it has shot up to some seven  billion. At that point, the world’s largest Muslim population, which would be  located in South Asia, was almost entirely under British rule. (In  1947, the population of the Indian subcontinent was under 350  million.) We are being asked to believe that jihadis killed, by the  year 1600, more people than lived in South Asia in the year 1600.  Keep in mind that India is one of the most densely populated parts  of the planet and has long been a centre of world culture and  civilization.” So, while TruthorFiction.com can confirm the authorship of Jan Morgan’s “Muslim Free Zone” essay, we cannot confirm the individual claims she makes about Muslims. Those claims will likely continue to be the subject of debate for years to come. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"Green Beret Sniper Bryan Sikes Destroys Michael Moore in Letter – Authorship Confirmed!","2015-03-17 20:38:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/green-beret-sniper-bryan-sikes-destroys-michael-moore-in-letter/"," Green Beret Sniper Bryan Sikes slammed filmmaker Michael Moore after Moore said on social media that he’d been taught that snipers are cowards. "," It’s true that Bryan Sikes penned an open letter to Michael Moore that appeared at the website Clash Daily on January 25, 2015. The letter was written in response to comments that Michael Moore made about snipers on Twitter. Moore said that he’d been taught that all snipers were cowards after the move American Sniper, which tells the story of former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, became a box office hit . Moore later denied that his comment was directed toward Chris Kyle, or American Sniper. Bryan Sikes responded with an open letter that appeared on Clash Daily, a website founded by conservative author Doug Giles. In the open letter , which was shared more than 300,000 times within days of publication, Sikes begins by calling Michael Moore a sweetheart: “Mr. Moore- Good afternoon there sweetheart, I hope this finds you alive and  well. You can thank our men and women of the armed forces for that,  by the way, and that also includes us cowardly snipers. It seems  you’ve found time between licking the jelly off your fingers and  releasing your grasp of a bear claw to tweet some junk about snipers  being cowards. My buddies and I got a good laugh over the tweet, so I thank you.  For a guy worth $50 million dollars, you sure have quite a bit to  bitch and cry about. I guess like a moth to flame, you too gravitate  towards things that are popular and in the moment — in this case  it’s snipers. Too bad for you that your attempt at being relevant  via your 70+ year old family experience has failed. It has only made  you look dumber than a bag of hammers. Next time you should try  something more original than going after snipers for one reason or  another…that was so last month.” This isn’t the first time that Bryan Sikes has taken issue with Hollywood personality, either. In May of 2014, Sikes blasted actress Gwyneth Paltrow for comparing cyberbullying to combat in another open letter published at Clash Daily: “To Miss Paltrow, I’d first like to start out by saying how terrible I feel for you  and all your friends that on a daily basis have to endure mean words  written by people you don’t know. I can only imagine the difficulty  of waking up in a 12,000 square foot Hollywood home and having your  assistant retrieve your iPhone, only to see that the battery is low  and someone on twitter (the social media concept that you and all of  your friends contribute to on an hourly basis to feed your ego and  narcissistic ways), has written a mean word or 2 about you. You’ve  hit the nail on the head, war is exactly like that. You should  receive a medal for the burden you have carried on your shoulders  due to these meanies on social media. You said, “Its almost like, how in war, you go through this bloody  dehumanizing thing and then something is defined out of it.” I could  see how you, and others like you in “the biz”, could be so insecure  and mentally weak that you could pair the difficulty of your life on  twitter to my brothers who have had their limbs ripped off and seen  their friends shot, blown up, burned and disfigured, or wake up  every morning in pain – while just starting the day is a challenge.  How about our wives? The ones that sign on to be there for us  through thick and thin, that help us to shake the hardships of war  upon our return? And do all this while being mothers to our kids,  keeping bills in order because we are always gone, and keeping our  lives glued together. They do all this, by the way, without a team  of accountants, nanny’s, personal assistants, and life coaches.  Yeah, reading a mean tweet is just like all that.” So, Bryan Sikes’ open letter to Michael Moore isn’t necessarily a surprise. The former Green Beret and recipient of the Purple Heart has a history of outspoken support for veterans. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Home Depot Christmas Tree Kills Kitten – Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:38:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/home-depot-christmas-tree-kills-kitten/"," A Christmas tree purchased from Home Depot was treated with a chemical that killed a family’s pet kitten. "," It’s true that a family says its pet kitten, Luna, died a day after they brought home a Christmas tree from Home Depot, but the kitten’s cause of death isn’t yet known. Paul Berto, a spokesperson for The Home Depot Canada, told TruthorFiction.com that the report pertains to just one of the retailer’s specialty decor trees, a Fraser fir with artificially frosted white tips. The tree was only sold at stores in Canada’s Ontario province. “Less than 300 units were sold,” Berto said. “From a scope standpoint, we have removed the product from the stores, and we’re working with vendors and merchants in determining where an issue may lie.” Home Depot’s vendor had never before encountered an issue with the product, Berto said, and the retailer hasn’t encountered any issues with the other varieties of fresh-cut Christmas trees it sells. Social media users quickly posted warnings about Home Depot Christmas trees after CBC News broke the story about Luna the kitten on December 11, 2014: “A kitten is dead after it apparently ingested some amount of ethylene glycol , a chemical commonly found in anti-freeze, suspected to have been on a Christmas tree purchased at Home Depot. A Stoney Creek, Ont., family adopted a black kitten named Luna from the cat rescue group called Forever Home. Kimberley Coates brought home a Christmas tree from Home Depot after taking the kitten home. They said the feline ingested needles from the tree and later died. A veterinarian informed the family the cause of death may be poisoning from ethylene glycol, extremely toxic to cats.” The Coates family said Luna began “acting strange, falling over, and had to be rushed to the vet” a day after she chewed needles on low-hanging branches of the frosted Fraser fir, The Hamilton Spectator reports : “Coates called Home Depot in a panic. She says the store told her the trees are sprayed with ‘a hypoallergenic pet-friendly substance akin to house paint.’ After speaking with Home Depot, Coates says the supplier provided her veterinarian with a list of ingredients in the spray, one of which is ethylene glycol. Coates put the tree outside and Home Depot came to pick it up. This is the same chemical found in antifreeze and is highly toxic to animals, which are drawn by its sweet taste. The family’s vet, Dr. Jenny Kungl, is cautious about jumping to conclusions. She says she’s awaiting post-mortem results and without that, ‘we need more significant evidence to say exactly what happened here.’” In the wake of reports of Luna’s death, online commenters have suggested that Home Depot sprays or treats all of its live Christmas trees with chemicals to preserve them. That’s not the case, Berto said. “The trees are harvested, packaged and shipped directly to the store,” Berto said. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"General Pete Piotrowski Says U.S. Alerted North Vietnamese before Bombing Strikes-Authorship Confirmed!","2015-03-17 20:38:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/general-pete-piotrowski-says-us-alerted-north-vietnamese-before-bombing-strikes/"," Retired U.S. General Pete Piotrowski wrote in his book that the U.S. government alerted the North Vietnamese government about its bombing targets ahead of time. "," It’s true that retired General John “Pete” Piotrowski relayed this accusation in his book, “Basic Airman to General: The Secret War & Other Conflicts: Lessons in Life and Leadership.” The claim that the U.S. notified the North Vietnamese government of airstrikes ahead of time went viral in early 2015 when an excerpt from General Piotrowski’s book appeared in chain emails: “Nearly twenty years later, I saw former Secretary of State Dean  Rusk being interviewed by Peter Arnett on a CBS documentary called  ‘The Ten Thousand Day War.’  Mr Arnett asked, ‘It has been rumored  that the United States provided the North Vietnamese government the  names of the targets that would be bombed the following day. Is  there any truth to that allegation?’ “To my astonishment and absolute disgust, the former Secretary  responded, ‘Yes. We didn’t want to harm the North Vietnamese people,  so we passed the targets to the Swiss embassy in Washington with  instructions to pass them to the NVN government through their  embassy in Hanoi.” It should be noted that documentary “ The Ten Thousand Day War” was made by the Canadian Broadcast Company (CBC), not CBS, as the email states. In the book , General Piotrowski also said former Secretary of State Dean Rusk said, “All we wanted to do is demonstrate to the North Vietnamese leadership that we could strike targets at will, but we didn’t want to kill innocent people. By giving the North Vietnamese advanced warning of the targets to be attacked, we thought they would tell the workers to go home.” Dean Rusk served as secretary of state under President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson. It’s true that Rusk issued “warnings” to the North Vietnamese to deter North Vietnamese aggression toward South Vietnam leading up to U.S. ground troops being deployed, but it’s not clear that warnings were sent after combat operations began. On May 22, 1964, Rusk warned North Vietnam in a speech before the American Law Institute in Washington, D.C.: “Secretary of State Dean Rusk explicitly accuses North Vietnam of  initiating and directing the aggression in South Vietnam. U.S.  withdrawal, said Rusk, ‘would mean not only grievous losses to the  free world in Southeast and Southern Asia but a drastic loss of  confidence in the will and capacity of the free world.’  He concluded: ‘There is a simple prescription for peace — leave your  neighbors alone.” In the fall, there was incontrovertible evidence  that North Vietnamese regular troops were moving down the Ho Chi  Minh Trail to join the Viet Cong in their war against the Saigon  government and its forces.’ Military advisors were present in Vietnam as Dean Rusk tried to broker peace in 1964, but U.S. combat units weren’t deployed to Vietnam until 1965, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . As for General John “ Pete ” Piotrowski, he went on to serve as commander-in-chief at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the U.S. Space Command. As an Air Force command pilot he logged more than 5,000 flying hours, which included 100 combat missions, according to his official Air Force bio . ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," Reps for George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin Clooney say that claims about a pending divorce are false.

Amal is an internationally recognized human rights lawyer who doesn’t fit the profile of Clooney’s previous love interests. That’s made the public — and celebrity gossip magazines — take a lot of interest in their relationship. But reps for the Clooneys insist that George and Amal are doing fine. Stan Rosenfield, a rep for the couple, said , “This story is totally made up in order to sell their magazines.” Another rep for the couple said tabloids have “looked for cracks” in the Clooney’s marriage since it began because “divorce” is easier to sell than “happiness.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"German Automaker Develops First Salt Water-Powered Car – Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-17 20:38:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/german-automaker-develops-first-salt-water-powered-car/"," A German automaker has developed the world’s first salt water-powered car that has been approved for travel on European roads. "," There’s some truth to this claim, but it’s also misleading. A German manufacturer has developed a battery system for electric cars that uses ionic salt water as a storage medium — but the car is still powered by electricity, not salt water. The company, nanoFlowcell, displayed the technology at the Geneva Motor Show in July of 2014 in a prototype car called the Quant e-Sportlimousine. The company describes the battery technology as a “beacon of hope” because it’s a simple and effective storage medium for electrical energy: “Flow cells are chemical batteries that combine aspects of an  electrochemical accumulator cell with those of a fuel cell. Liquid  electrolytes circulate through two separate cells in which a ‘cold  burning’ takes place, during which oxidation and reduction processes  happen in parallel and thereby produce electrical power for  the drive train. The flow cell battery’s greatest advantage lies in its range: It can  drive a vehicle 20-times further than a conventional lead-acid  battery and 5-times further than the lithium-ion technology that  powers most of today’s electric cars. Flow cell batteries are also  durable. Furthermore, recharging them does not take hours and hours.  All that is required to recharge them is to exchange spent  electrolytes (which can be recharged outside the vehicle) for new,  charged fluid.” Wired Magazine explains that flow cell batteries like this are typically comprised of two kinds of metallic salts dissolved in liquids inside the battery that are separated by a membrane: “Ion exchange takes place between the membrane, although the liquids  themselves do not mix. When the battery is charged, electrical  energy causes a chemical reduction reaction in one of the liquids  and an oxidation reaction in the other. When the battery is in use,  the reverse reaction takes place. nanoFlowcell has made this process  very efficient so that the batteries can be small and the prototype  car has a range of up to 600 kilometers (372 miles) — at least  according to the company.” Excitement about the salt water-powered car took flight in January of 2015 when an article published by the website Aether Force appeared in many forwarded emails. The article, which appears under the headline, “Electric Car Powered by Salt Water: 920 hp, 373 miles/tank,” begins: “It’s finally here folks and it is LEGIT. Tesla eat your heart out, the Germans have created an electrical car  powered by salt water. It has four electric engines and is FAST with  some pretty sweet fuel economy for a sports car. Leave the Bugatti  at home and stop by the beach to refuel. The recent announcement that the Quant e-Sportlimousine, which is a  salt water powered car, has been certified for use on European roads  is a big sign that the Oil Cartels are losing the energy war.” While the article isn’t incorrect, it seems to misled readers on two fronts. First, it said that the car is “salt water powered” when, in reality, it’s powered by electricity that is stored in an ionic salt-water battery. The term “salt water-powered car” conjures images of pulling up to a filling station and pumping the car’s gas tank full of salt water. The article’s second misleading claim is that the battery’s approval for use on European roads means that it will likely disrupt global energy markets in the near future. The technology is still in the concept phase and is likely years away from mass production, if it reaches that point at all. Motor Authority reports : “The plan now is to get four working prototypes built so that  real-world testing can begin. (Company founder Nunzio La Vecchia) hopes  to eventually have a small production run of cars powered by his  nanoFlowcell technology.” Still, the technology could hold great promise. nanoFlowcell announced in December of 2014 that it would again showcase the technology at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show.

"FDA Admits Chicken Meat Contains Arsenic – Truth! & Outdated!","2015-03-17 20:38:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fda-admits-chicken-meat-contains-arsenic/"," The FDA has admitted that most chicken meat sold in the U.S. contains cancer-causing arsenic. "," This claim was mostly true in 2011, but it has been resolved. In 2011, the FDA carried out a study on the effect an animal drug called Roxarson, or 3-Nitro , had on chicken meat. The FDA allowed poultry producers to use the drug to prevent parasitic diseases in chickens, to promote weight gain, and to improve the color of chicken meat. The FDA studied 100 boiler chickens to determine whether the use of 3-Nitro led to elevated levels of arsenic in chicken meat. According to the study , higher levels of inorganic arsenic were found in the livers of chickens treated with 3-Nitro than in chickens that were not treated: Roxarsone and its metabolites were present in liver tissues from  chicks fed roxarsone-medicated feed. The incurred levels of  inorganic arsenic species were highly variable in treated chicks  but appeared to be significantly greater than that in the untreated  control birds. Withdrawal of the medicated feed led to a  time-dependent decrease in various arsenic species, many of which  were unidentified. Whether or not these unknowns could pose any  toxicological risk will be dependent upon their subsequent  identification and testing. The FDA first approved 3-Nitro for human consumption in 1944. Bernadette Dunham, the director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, explained the purpose of the FDA’s review of the drug, and the results of the study: Over the past seven to eight years, published scientific reports  indicated that organic arsenic can transform into inorganic arsenic  in the environment. These reports caused FDA to question whether  the organic arsenic that was present in animal drugs such as  Roxarsone would also transform into inorganic arsenic when used in  animals. We would like to stress that the levels of inorganic arsenic found  in chicken livers are very low and represent a very low health risk  to people who eat chicken. We would also like to stress that  consumers can continue to eat chicken as 3-Nitro is suspended from  the market. Furthermore, FDA does not believe there is a need to  recall chicken already in commerce. FDA’s findings demonstrate a  very low but avoidable public exposure to inorganic arsenic, a  carcinogen. Then, in June of 2011, Pfizer announced that it had voluntarily suspended the sale of 3-Nitro because of the FDA’s findings, which resolved the issue. However, the eRumor resurfaced as breaking news in early 2015. An outdated report claimed that the FDA had “just” admitted that 70% of chicken meat sold in the U.S. contained arsenic: So a few days ago when I turned on the tube and saw the news  headlines stating that the FDA has finally confirmed that chicken  meat sold in the USA contains arsenic, my head, and stomach, nearly  hit the roof. This cancer-causing toxic chemical, that in high doses  could kill you, is actually being added to chicken feed on  purpose, giving store-bought chicken the illusion of healthy  coloring and plump appearance. Shockingly, this is the case with  more than 70 percent of all U.S. chickens! That is just awful! But while the eRumor’s claims about 3-Nitro are outdated, there are more arsenic-based animal drugs that are approved for human consumption, the FDA says : 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) was the first arsenic-based product approved for  use in animal feed and is currently the most commonly  used arsenic-based animal drug. Other arsenic-based drugs that are  approved for use in food-producing animals (poultry and swine)  include nitarsone, arsanilic acid, and carbarsone. Current data  indicate that only the 3-Nitro and nitarsone products are being  marketed. These drugs all have forms of organic arsenic–the form of  arsenic that is less toxic and not carcinogenic–as their active  ingredient. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"Former Marine Dad Banned from Daughter’s High School over “Islamic indoctrination” claims – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/former-marine-dad-banned-from-daughters-high-school-over-islamic-indoctrination-claims/"," A former Marine named John Kevin Wood was banned from his daughter’s high school in Maryland after he took issue with an Islam study course that was part of her 11th grade world history class. "," It’s true that La Plata High School filed a no-trespass order against former Marine John Kevin Wood after he took issue with what he described as Islamic indoctrination in his daughter’s world history class. School officials defended the curriculum and said the no-trespass order was filed because John Kevin Wood threatened to create a “disruption” at La Plata High School in Maryland. The Thomas More Law Center (TMLC), a self-described national public interest firm that defends and promotes America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and moral values, is representing John Kevin Wood and his wife, Melissa, in a related court case. TMLC said that Wood discovered in October of 2014 that his daughter had been forced to “repeat religious tenets of Islam” and “write how the Prophet Muhammad was visited by the Angel Gabriel and preached that there is only one true god, who is Allah” as part of a world history homework assignment. In a news release TMLC went on to describe John Kevin Wood’s reaction: “When John Wood discovered the Islamic propaganda and indoctrination, he was rightfully outraged, and that evening unsuccessfully tried to contact the school by phone to voice his objections. Wood witnessed firsthand the destruction caused in the name of Allah and knows Islam is not ‘a religion of peace.’ He served in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and lost friends in that action. On 9-11, Wood responded as a firefighter to the smoldering Pentagon. He refused to allow La Plata High School to subject his daughter to Islamic indoctrination despite the threatened academic consequences. The next day, October 23rd, Wood had a phone conversation with a La Plata vice principal where he again reiterated his objections to his daughter being indoctrinated into the religion of Islam. The vice principal indicated that his daughter, a high school junior with college hopes, would receive zeros on her assignments on Islam if she did not complete them. He asked how the religion of Islam could be taught when schools are prohibited from teaching the religion of Christianity. The following day, October 24th, John Wood again spoke with the vice principal. She again refused to allow an alternative assignment.” However, school officials said the assignment had been given for years and related to economic policies in the Middle East. La Plata High School Vice Principal told the BayNet: “This is a world history class. We are not teaching religion. Part of those world history studies involves the economics of a region and part of that is the religion which relates to the economy of that part of the world. In the Middle East, Islam is the only religion and it contributes greatly to the economics of the region. In the overall scope of things, she said, Christianity is taught in segments about the reformation in Europe, along with Hinduism and Buddhism. “At some point we do comparative religion,” she said. “Religion is a big part of world history.” However, school officials said the assignment had been given for years and related to economic policies in the Middle East. The La Plata High School vice principal told Bay Net: “Students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it, along with politics, culture, economics and geography, contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example, when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation, students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India, students examine Hinduism and Buddhism. “There is also misinformation about why the school issued a No Trespass Order on a parent. This parent threatened to cause problems that would potentially disrupt La Plata High School this morning. To ensure the safety of students and staff at the school, the school administration placed a No Trespass Order on this parent.” So, while it’s true that former Marine John Kevin Wood was banned from his daughter’s high school for protesting an Islam study course, the circumstances leading up to it are disputed.

"," Questions about President Obama’s birth certificate posed in this forwarded email are pretty easy to answer, so we’ll look at each one of them. President Obama’s U.S. citizenship (and right to the presidency) has been questioned since he first arrived on the national political scene as a senator in 2006. The White House released a long form copy of Obama’s birth certificate in 2008 in hopes of bringing an end to the issue, and the four questions posed by the eRumor attempt to prove that the birth certificate was forged. The author of the email is identified as Richard Silverlieb, an attorney from New Jersey. TruthorFiction.com tracked down an attorney from Greater New York named Richard Silverlieb and reached out to confirm the email’s authorship. Future updates will be posted here. Authorship aside, the email makes specific claims about President Obama’s birth certificate that we can investigate. Here’s a look at each claim: President Obama is identified as an African-American on the birth certificate- Fiction! President Obama is not identified as an African-American on his birth certificate. The birth certificate doesn’t name a race for Obama, but his mother as identified as “Caucasian” and his father is identified as “African.” President Obama’s birth certificate says his father is from Kenya, which wasn’t a place in 1961 – Fiction! Obama’s birth certificate says his father was born in “Kenya, East Africa,” but the claim that Kenya wasn’t a known place in 1961 is false. Kenya’s original name was Kikuyu. It was named after Mount Kikuyu, which means “mountain of whiteness” because of its snow-capped peaks. However, during British colonization, the name was shortened to “Kenya” because British settlers were unable to pronounce “Kikuyu.” It’s true that Kenya won its independence in 1963, but it was known as Kenya for decades before that. Kapi’olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital, the listed place of President Obama’s birth, wasn’t called that in 1961- Fiction! The medical facility that President Obama was born at has been known as the Kapi’olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital since 1931. Click here for a previous TruthorFiction.com story that covers the history of the hospital. President Obama said his father fought in World War II in his book – Fiction! Obama has regularly talked about how is grandfather fought in World War II and was able to attend college because of the GI Bill. In a video from 2012, Obama misspoke and said that his father served in World War II, but it’s assumed that he meant to say that his grandfather had served. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," It’s true that 59% of fresh tuna in American restaurants and markets is not actually tuna, according to a 2013 study. The study was undertaken by Oceana, an ocean conservation advocacy group , to uncover seafood fraud, or the practice of passing off one kind of seafood for a cheaper kind. Tuna and red snapper were among the most commonly substituted seafood, but overall 33% of samples collected were incorrectly labeled: “From 2010 to 2012, Oceana conducted one of the largest seafood  fraud investigations in the world to date, collecting more than  1,200 seafood samples from 674 retail outlets in 21 states to  determine if they were honestly labeled. DNA testing found that  one-third (33 percent) of the 1,215 samples analyzed nationwide were  mislabeled, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  guidelines.” The study found that 54% of retail outlets visited sold mislabeled fish. Overall, 67 out of 114 tuna samples collected, or 59%, were mislabeled. One of the most common substitutions was a fish called escolar being substituted for white tuna: “Swapping escolar for white tuna is not only illegal, but it can  also cause serious health problems. Escolar, or oilfish (Lepidocybium  flavobrunneum), is not actually a tuna species at all, but is  instead a snake mackerel that contains a naturally occurring toxin,  gempylotoxin. This toxin can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal  problems even for some who eat only a few ounces of the  fish. Because of the health problems associated with escolar, Italy  and Japan have banned it, several other countries have issued health  advisories for it, and the FDA advises against the sale of it in the  U.S.” For its part, the FDA developed an “online learning module” in October of 2014 to help the seafood industry, retailers and state regulators ensure that seafood products are property labeled. The FDA said , “Proper identification of seafood is important throughout the seafood supply chain to ensure that appropriate food safety controls are implemented and that consumers are getting the type of seafood they expect and for which they are paying.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Facebook to Begin Deleting Inactive Likes From Business Pages-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-to-begin-deleting-inactive-likes-from-business-pages/"," Facebook will delete “inactive likes” from business pages on the social network. "," This eRumor is true. Facebook said it would begin to delete “likes” that came from accounts that are no longer active in mid-March of 2015. The change was supposed to ensure “data on Facebook is consistent and up-to-date,” the social network said: “There are two primary benefits to removing voluntarily deactivated  and memorialized Facebook accounts from Pages’ like counts: “Business results: Removing inactive Facebook accounts from Page  audience data gives businesses up-to-date insights on the people who  actively follow their Page and makes it easier for businesses to  find people like their followers through tools like lookalike  audiences. “Consistency: We already filter out likes and comments generated by  deactivated or memorialized accounts from individual Page posts, so  this update keeps data consistent.” Facebook said the change wouldn’t have much impact on individuals, but that business pages would probably notice a “small dip” in their number of likes. Some businesses have been known to purchase Facebook likes for their pages from “click farms” in the past. By hiring click farms, businesses are able to make their pages appear more popular than they actually are. If those likes came from accounts that have since been deactivated, the new policy would wipe them out. But other click farms will continue to thrive, the Huffington Post reports : “The CEO of Dhaka-based social media promotion firm Unique IT World  said he has paid workers to manually click on clients’ social media  pages, making it harder for Facebook, Google and others to catch  them. ‘Those accounts are not fake, they were genuine,’ Shaiful  Islam said.” And it’s not just businesses that pay for likes. Even the U.S. State Department got in on the action. A 2013 report found that the State Department had paid $630,000 to boost its social media numbers. Its likes jumped from 100,000 to 2 million over that time. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," This claim is a hoax. A report by the fake news website Empire News sent social media abuzz with a bogus report that a homeless man in San Diego had turned out to be Elvis Presley: “Earlier this month, an 80-year-old, homeless, white-bearded man was  found deceased under an overpass in San Diego, California. Nobody  knew the man’s name, but friends referred to him as Jessie, so  investigators decided to try DNA testing with hopes that something  would pop up in the nationwide DNA database. What popped up on the  computer screen in the high-tech lab stunned everyone. The DNA  results of ‘Jessie Doe’ were an exact match to the one and only,  Elvis Aaron Presley.” The story was quickly shared nearly 100,000 times on Facebook, and many users believed that Elvis Presley had been found alive and well nearly 40 years after his supposed death. Unfortunately, Empire News is a fake news website, according to its disclaimer . Conspiracy theories that Elvis Presley faked his own death and went into hiding have persisted for decades. That started a short time after Elvis was buried in August of 1977. It was believed that Elvis’s middle name was spelled “Aron” but appeared on the headstone as “Aaron.” The misspelling led many to speculate that Elvis wasn’t actually buried there, but it turned out that Elvis’s name was legally spelled “Aaron.” He had tried to legally change it to “Aron” at some point to match the name of his stillborn twin, Garon, but didn’t follow through, the Telegraph reports . After Elvis’s death, his estate tried to hide his prescription drug abuse from the public, which also fueled speculation of a coverup. A doctor close to Elvis told reporters that Elvis had died from heart failure, which doctors who conducted the autopsy knew wasn’t true, Salon reports .

"," It’s true that eos lip balm users have reported finding black mold inside the product. Reports of black mold found inside eos lip balm have sporadically appeared on social media for years. In February of 2015, one eos lip balm user’s account of finding black mold inside a container of half-used lip balm gained a lot of attention on Facebook: “I really liked your lip balm, until I got to the middle of mine and found the bottom was full of mold. I thought there was an air bubble in the middle, but it turns out it was a blob of mold. I tried to scrape it off, but it went all the way down to the bottom of the container. Super disappointed and disgusted. That was a waste of my money, and I won’t be buying any of your products again.” In the comments section under the post, many people uploaded photos of eos lip balm speckled with what they call black mold. And these reports aren’t necessarily new, either. Online reports of black mold found inside of eos lip balm date back to 2012. For its part, eos responded on Facebook that it “very occasionally” gets reports of its lip balm users finding black mold because it’s a natural product that doesn’t contain any preservatives: “We do very occasionally hear of this. Mold will grow on many surfaces, especially warm and moist places and on products with natural ingredients. The best way to prevent this is to try to not get the lip balm itself wet when applying it (apply to dry lips) and/or let any moisture that’s on the lip balm dry before you put the top back on. I hope this helps and thank you for using our products. “While mold very rarely grows on our lip balm, it has been known to happen, especially with all-natural ingredients. Our policy is that we’re happy to replace any defective lip balm so long as the customer provides a picture. So if you want to send a picture of the moldy lip balm to info@evolutionofsmooth.com , we’d be happy to send a coupon for a replacement. Thanks again for the feedback as it helps us improve.” The USDA reports that most molds found on food and consumer products are not toxic, but it is possible for some varieties to cause allergic reactions or respiratory problems.

"Claims About the Disneyland Measles Outbreak – Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-17 20:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-about-the-disneyland-measles-outbreak/"," Measles vaccines are less effective than previously believed and the patient zero measles carrier in the Disneyland measles outbreak may have been immunized against measles. "," Claims in this email are mostly true, but they are presented in potentially misleading ways to argue the case for the anti-vaccination movement. The eRumor first appeared in a blog post at GreenMedInfo.com . The mission of the website is to “provide free and convenient access to biomedical research available today on the therapeutic value of natural substances in disease prevention and treatment.” The founder of GreenMedInfo.com , and the listed author of the eRumor, is a man named Sayer Ji. He was a philosophy major who spent five years as a wilderness therapy specialist before becoming an “educator and consultant for the natural products industry and health and wellness field,” according to the bio on his website. The blog post went viral as a national debate about measles immunizations was sparked by an outbreak of measles at Disneyland in December of 2014. The post was quickly shared more than 60,000 times on social media and appeared in countless forwarded emails. Here’s a look at some of the eRumor’s individual claims: It’s widely believed that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 99% effective – Truth! This claim is mostly true, but the level of effectiveness varies from individual to individual. The CDC reports : “More than 95% of the people who receive a single dose of MMR will  develop immunity to all 3 viruses. A second vaccine dose  gives immunity to almost all of those who did not respond to the  first dose.” But vaccines have a margin of failure, even for those who have a double dose of the measles vaccine, Wired reports : “That’s why the CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine: After the  first dose, 5 to 7 percent of people won’t have a good enough  antibody response to protect them. A second dose ensures that enough  people get antibodies above that protective threshold to control the  disease. “And even with two doses, you can get some failure,” says  Greg Wallace, lead of the measles, mumps, rubella and polio team at  the CDC, “whether it’s because the initial response isn’t perfect,  or because the response waned in some people.” The World Health Organization reports that about 205 million children were vaccinated worldwide in 2013. Even with a 1% failure rate, more than 2 million children who were vaccinated in 2013 alone may still be susceptible to infection. That number could be higher if all of the 205 million children who received their first vaccination did not receive a second. 18% of measles cases occur in those who have been vaccinated against it – Unproven! The eRumor doesn’t cite a source for the “18%” claim, which makes it impossible to prove or disprove. During a separate measles outbreak in California in 2014, it was found that 18% of the people who contracted measles had been vaccinated, the Los Angeles Times reports : “Health officials said they are much more concerned about those who  are not immunized than about the cases of those who got sick  despite being vaccinated. ‘There’s the tug here between a very effective vaccine and  a very infectious virus,’ said Orange County Public Health  Officer Dr. Eric Handler. ‘And so when you have  a scenario where hundreds of people get exposed, then even if  the vaccine is 99% good after two doses, you’re going to have a  handful of people who are going to get sick.” So, the 18% statistic appears to be purely anecdotal. It refers to one specific outbreak, not all measles outbreaks. An immunized person in New York transmitted measles to four people for the first time in 2011 – Truth! This claim is true. A 22-year-old woman who received two doses of MRR early in life contracted measles in 2011, and four other people contracted measles after exposure to her. While it’s not uncommon for someone who has been vaccinated to contract measles, this was the first time that a vaccinated person was able to pass the virus on to others. A report that was published in the Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America in February of 2014 concluded: “This is the first report of measles transmission from a  twice-vaccinated individual with documented secondary  vaccine failure. The clinical presentation and laboratory data of  the index patient were typical of measles in a naive  individual. Secondary patients had robust anamnestic antibody  responses. No tertiary cases occurred despite numerous contacts.  This outbreak underscores the need for thorough epidemiologic and  laboratory investigation of suspected cases of measles regardless of  vaccination status.” TruthorFiction.com reached out to report co-author Dr. Jennifer Rosen of the New York City Bureau of Immunization for comment. Future updates will be posted here. – Scientists have linked measles vaccinations to autism – Fiction! There’s no scientific evidence that vaccinations can lead to autism. The claim first surfaced in 1998 in the Lancet, a British medical journal. In it, Dr. Andrew Wakefield claimed that his research proved that MMR was unsafe. However, the research paper was officially retracted in February of 2010. The New York Times reports : “Dr. Wakefield’s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children  with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal  development followed by severe mental regressions. He speculated  that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may have  caused some sort of chronic intestinal measles infection that  in turn damaged the children’s brains. He suggested that the  combined vaccine should be split into three separate shots and given  over a longer period of time. “But an investigation by a British journalist found financial and  scientific conflicts that Dr. Wakefield did not reveal in his paper.  For instance, part of the costs of Dr. Wakefield’s research were  paid by lawyers for parents seeking to sue vaccine makers for  damages. Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997  a measles vaccine that would succeed if the combined vaccine were  withdrawn or discredited.” Despite the Lancet’s retraction, Wakefield’s work is regularly cited by MMR opponents. – Patient zero in the Disneyland measles outbreak was immunized- Unproven!

"," The word dhimmitude is not included in the Obamacare healthcare law. A chain email claims that the word dhimmitude appears on page 107 of the healthcare law, and it defines the word’s meaning as: “Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling  non-Muslim populations conquered through jihad (Holy War).  Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for  tolerating their presence AND as a coercive means of  converting conquered remnants to Islam.” A search for the word dhimmitude in the healthcare law turned up no results. A search for the word in a companion bill to the healthcare law also yielded no results, so the eRumor’s claim is false. And the word dhimmitude does not appear in the Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam . However, a number of definitions for the word “dhimmi” can be found: “Dhimmi (Subject Entry) Non-Muslim under protection of Muslim law. A covenant of protection  was made with conquered “Peoples of the Book,” which included Jews,  Christians, Sabaeans. Dhimmī (Subject Entry) In Islamic law, a non-Muslim who is under a covenant of protection (dhimmah)  with the Muslim authority is considered dhimmī. Dhimmī (Subject Entry) In Islamic law one who is in the covenant of protection (dhimmah)  with the Muslim power is considered dhimmī.” In the book “ Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide ” dhimmitude is described as a social system in which non-Muslims (or dhimmis) live under Muslim law. The term appears to have been coined in the last 30 years or so by scholars and social commentators, but it doesn’t’ specifically refer to jihad or taxing non-Muslims, as the eRumor claims. And it’s true that individuals can be exempted from penalties under Obamacare for religious reasons, but no specific exemptions are listed for Muslims. And the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to exempt Hobby Lobby from the healthcare law’s contraceptive requirement based on the Christian beliefs of its owner demonstrates that religious exemptions do not apply solely to one religious group.

Paul Ryan’s budget plan would slash federal spending by $2.5 trillion over 10 years. "," A long list of cuts to government spending listed in this eRumor is real, but the list wasn’t taken from Paul Ryan’s budget plan. The list of spending cuts came from the Spending Reduction Act of 2011 , which was introduced by Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan in January of 2011. Paul Ryan was not one of the Spending Reduction Act’s 32 co-sponsors . The bill later died, and lawmakers signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 into law instead, which Paul Ryan voted in favor of. The Republican Study Committee (RSC) undertook a study on the impact of Jim Jordan’s bill in 2011, and the list of government spending cuts included in the eRumor was taken directly from the group’s report . The RSC found that: “The Spending Reduction Act of 2011 reduces federal spending by $2.5  trillion over ten years. The bill will specifically hold FY 2011  non-security discretionary spending to FY 08 levels, hold  non-defense discretionary spending to FY 06 levels thereafter for  the rest of the ten-year budget window (the same level as in effect  during the last year of GOP control of the Congress), and include  more than 100 other program eliminations or savings proposals,  consisting of proposals from the RSC Sunset Caucus, YouCut, or past  RSC budgets.” And it should be noted that opponents of the Spending Reduction Act of 2011 called the accuracy of the RSC’s report — and the merits of the bill — into question, ABC News reports : “After reading this radical proposal by House Republicans, we now  know why they have been so tight-lipped about their budget plans.  The likelihood of this becoming law is around zero, but even  putting forward a plan that puts more people out of work  and endangers our economic recovery calls into question how serious  the GOP is about tackling our nation’s most difficult challenges,”  said Doug Thornell, spokesman for the ranking member of the House  Budget Committee Chris Van Hollen. “House Republicans need to  realize that the campaign is over, the time for political stunts  has past, and they have a responsibility to move the economy forward  not backwards.” Somehow in January of 2015, the list of cuts from the RSC’s 2011 report was included in forwarded emails that touted the benefits of Paul Ryan’s budget plan. Paul Ryan’s actual 2015 budget plan is called “ The Path to Prosperity .” Ryan said his budget would cut spending by $5.1 trillion — more than double the eRumor’s $2.5 trillion claim — over the next 10 years: “By balancing the budget, the Path to Prosperity will promote  economic growth. Over the next ten years, it will cut $5.1 trillion  in spending, and CBO has said that such a plan would help  the economy. By paying down the debt, the federal government will  help keep interest rates low, which will spur greater investment and  productivity.

Evan Lapiska, a senior public relations specialist at Target, explained to TruthorFiction.com in an email: “At Target, we use a number of different factors to determine the  price for an item. The ending digit of a clearance price is  determined by several factors including the original retail price  and the applied percentage discount. It is not possible to determine  the final markdown or timing of the price change from the item’s  current price.” Advanced inventory systems enable retailers like Target and their vendors to track product margins and price points in real time to determine prices. The retailer uses a system called the retail inventory accounting method (RIM) to set regular product prices and sale prices, Target reports : “Under RIM, inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are  calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value  inventory. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in  the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will  result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market  because permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of  the retail value of inventory.” Target offers various types of promotions and sales, and each type serves a different purpose for the retailer. Simply understanding the differences between each promotion may help shoppers make more informed decisions. According Target’s investor relations department: “The price reduction on items labeled ‘Sale’ or ‘Temporary Price  Cut’ is for a limited time only. The price reduction on items  labeled ‘Price Cut’ is permanent. The price reduction  on ‘Clearance’ items is also permanent; in addition, these items are  usually being discontinued, and the price reduction is valid only as  supplies last.” The eRumor only makes claims about the prices of clearance items. Since clearance items are often being discontinued, the amount of inventory on hand should be able to help shoppers determine how long a clearance sale will last, and whether the price could be lowered again in the future.

"Clint Eastwood Once Threatened to Kill Michael Moore – Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clint-eastwood-threatened-to-kill-michael-moore/"," Clint Eastwood, director of the “American Sniper” biopic on the life of Chris Kyle, threatened to kill fellow director Michael Moore at an awards dinner held in 2005. "," Clint Eastwood did in fact threaten to kill Michael Moore at the 2005 National Board of Review awards dinner, but Eastwood’s threat was taken as an off-colored joke at the time. The story resurfaced in January of 2015 after Michael Moore tweeted that he’d been taught to believe that all snipers were cowards: My uncle was killed by a sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were  cowards. Will shoot u in the Back. Snipers aren’t heroes. And  invaders r worse. Moore’s tweet came days after Clint Eastwood’s biopic “American Sniper” broke box office records. The film detailed the life of Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL who is regarded as the deadliest sniper in military history. In the face of a public backlash, Moore said that he made the comment on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day because the civil rights activist had been killed by a sniper — not in response to Eastwood’s blockbuster hit. Still, the perceived spat between Michael Moore and Clint Eastwood led the website MRCTV to revisit the 2005 National Board of Review awards dinner in an article that quickly earned more than 100,000 views: At the National Board Review dinner in 2005, Moore and Eastwood were  both present, being honored on behalf of their films, “Bowling for  Columbine,” and “Million Dollar Baby.” Clint Eastwood accepted his award, and said the following, “Michael  Moore and I actually have a lot in common – we both appreciate  living in a country where there’s free expression,” Then came the . . . joke. “But, Michael, if you ever show up at my front door with a camera –  I’ll kill you.” The audience laughed, Moore laughed, then Eastwood said, “I mean it…” The exchange really happened, and media outlets light-heartedly covered it at the time. Clint Eastwood was at the dinner to accept an award for “Million Dollar Baby” and Michael Moore was there to be honored for “Fahrenheit 9/11” (the eRumor incorrectly reported that Moore was being honored for “Bowling for Columbine”), the New York Daily News reports . Michael Moore later reflected on the incident in a column on Clint Eastwood’s speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention hat was published by the Daily Beast. Moore admitted that Eastwood’s comments “creeped me out a bit.” Moore continues: A few years ago, at the annual National Board of Review film awards  held at Tavern on the Green in New York, I was there to hand out  one of the honors. When it came time for Eastwood to accept his, he  went up to the microphone and growled to me in front of the  audience, “If you ever show up at my house with that camera, I’ll  shoot you on sight.” The audience laughed, I laughed, but the person  who issued the threat wasn’t laughing. That creeped me out a bit. I  made sure never to go stand on Clint Eastwood’s lawn. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"Crocodile Bile Tainted Beer Kills Dozens in African – Investigation Pending!","2015-03-17 20:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/crocodile-bile-tainted-beer-kills-dozens-in-african/"," Scores of mourners at a funeral in Mozambique, Africa, died after they drank a traditional homebrewed beer that was poisoned with crocodile bile. "," It’s true that dozens of mourners died after drinking a traditional beer in Africa, but their cause of death isn’t yet clear. The eRumor started after the Associated Press reported that the beer had likely been poisoned with crocodile bile: MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — When a crocodile is killed, the bile of  the animal must be immediately removed and buried in front of  witnesses to prove that it has not fallen into the wrong hands, to  be used as poison, according to some African traditions. The deadly greenish-brown liquid, produced in the liver and stored  in the gallbladder, is now believed to have been put into  traditional beer that killed 69 people who drank it at a funeral on  Saturday in Mozambique’s northeast Tete province, health authorities  said. District health official, Alex Albertini, said poisoning by  crocodile bile was common in the area, in an interview with Radio  Mozambique. News outlets from around the world quickly echoed the report of deadly crocodile bile-infused beer, and the eRumor was born. Still, local health officials hadn’t determined what had poisoned the funeral goers — and scientists dispute the local legend that crocodile bile is poisonous. A translated report from Radio Mozambique doesn’t even name crocodile bile as a possible source of the poison, so it appears that the sensational idea led news outlets around the world to run with the unverified story. Radio Mozambique quoted Attorney General Beatriz Buchili: “So far no clues. (Local authorities), in coordination with other  institutions, (are) working on all fronts to determine the causes  and the type of product used to contaminate drinking. After that,  and if it is proved to have been a criminal act, we blame the  alleged perpetrators.” The victims reportedly drank a traditional local beer called “Phombe” — a mixture of sorghum, maize and sugar — on their way home from a funeral. Olivia Olocane, the 60-year-old woman who brewed the phombe, was among its first victims, the Global Post reports . The drink also killed a number of Olocane’s family members and neighbors. And as local officials rush to determine what led to the deaths of the mourners, it’s not even clear that crocodile bile is deadly. A study on commercial crocodile farming presented at the World Crocodile Conference in 2013 concluded that crocodile bile could be safe for human consumption in limited amounts. Similarly, Christian Lindmeier, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, told the Washington Post that crocodile bile is often used in cheap African home brew: “The use of bile is not uncommon in the production of local or poor  quality beer but is not known to be toxic to the extent this  outbreak shows,” he said. The cause of the mourners’ deaths won’t be known until local officials complete toxicology tests and autopsies. Future updates will be posted here. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"CDC Says Mothers Shouldn’t Breastfeed to Make Vaccines More Effective – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cdc-says-mothers-should-not-breastfeed/"," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised young mothers to delay breastfeeding because studies show that it could make vaccines less effective for their babies. "," This claim is false. A number of blog sites have cited a 2010 study titled, “The Inhibitory Effect of Breast Milk on Inactivity of Live Oral Rotavirus Vaccines,” in making this claim. The study explored why vaccines are less effective among children in poor, developing countries than in middle income and industrialized countries. According to the study’s abstract: The lower immunogenicity and efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in poor developing countries could be explained, in part, by higher titers of IgA and neutralizing activity in breast milk consumed by their infants at the time of immunization that could effectively reduce the potency of the vaccine. Strategies to overcome this negative effect, such as delaying breastfeeding at the time of immunization, should be evaluated. Researchers from the CDC did participate in the study, as the eRumor claimed. But the study does not suggest that women in the U.S. should delay breastfeeding. It suggests that delayed breastfeeding “should be evaluated” in developing countries at the time of the child’s vaccination. In the U.S, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) working group suggests that young mothers forgo immunizations — not breastfeeding — to avoid complications in their children: Precaution: A condition in a recipient that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction or that might compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity. Under usual circumstances, vaccination should be deferred. However, vaccination might be indicated because benefits outweigh risks. In the context of pregnancy and breastfeeding, serious adverse reaction includes maternal, fetal or neonatal serious adverse events linked to the vaccine. Contraindication means that there is direct evidence or strong biologic plausibility and suggestive evidence that the risk of severe adverse event is elevated for at least one of these groups. Precaution means there is no supporting evidence but there is some biologic plausibility; precaution may also mean that there is a lack of data to support safety. For its part, the CDC encourages that all young mothers breastfeed their babies and works to increase breastfeeding rates. The CDC reports : One of the most highly effective preventive measures a mother can take to protect the health of her infant is to breastfeed. However, in the United States, although most mothers hope to breastfeed, and 79% of babies start out being breastfed, only 19% are exclusively breastfed 6 months later. Additionally, rates are significantly lower for African-American infants. The success rate among mothers who want to breastfeed can be greatly improved through active support from their families, friends, communities, clinicians, health care leaders, employers, and policymakers. Given the importance of breastfeeding for the health and wellbeing of mothers and children, it is critical that we take action across the country to support breastfeeding. And “deferred breastfeeding” is a very small portion of global efforts to increase the effectiveness of vaccines in developing countries. One of the biggest hurdles is that vaccines must be kept cold to remain effective, yet children live in remote areas with limited access to electricity and refrigeration, so vaccines often spoil, the humanitarian group Deutsche Welle reports : Health workers have to keep vaccines cool at all times – from the moment of their production until they are administered by injection or in other ways. “This is one of the reasons why we’re still unable to vaccinate many children against diseases, which have been wiped out in developed countries – polio, for example,” says Sebastian Dietrich, a physician working with Doctors without Borders. “We just can’t get the vaccines to very remote areas while keeping them cool.” When Doctors Without Borders vaccinates people in developing countries, they face serious challenges, says Dietrich. Most sensitive vaccines solutions become unusable as soon as their temperature rises above eight degrees Celsius. Dietrich and his colleagues have to get the vaccines through customs before they go bad, and they have to find storage rooms with good refrigeration, or transport the vaccines by car to remote areas, where there may not even be electricity. Deutsche Welle concludes that developing nanovaccines that don’t need refrigeration is the key to increasing effectiveness — not delayed breastfeeding. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Bill O’Reilly Embellished Combat Experiences and Has a Brian Williams Problem-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:38:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-oreilly-embellished-combat-experiences-and-has-a-brian-williams-problem/"," Fox News host Bill O’Reilly “has a Brian Williams problem” because he lied about reporting from a combat zone during a brief war between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands in the 1980s. "," Bill O’Reilly disputes reports that he lied about or embellished his combat experience in the Falkland Islands in the early 1980s. Accusations about Bill O’Reilly’s combat zone experiences in the Falkland Islands War surfaced after NBC News anchor Brian Williams was placed on a six-month suspension for relaying untruthful accounts about his experiences reporting from Iraq. USA Today reports : “The scandal erupted earlier this month when Williams attended a New York Rangers game with a soldier who helped guard him and other American soldiers while a convoy of military helicopters they were flying on was forced to land on a desert in Iraq in 2003. “Williams said the helicopter he was on had been hit by enemy fire and forced down. Veterans from the convoy challenged Williams’ story — which he has repeated in the past — on Facebook. And the anchorman recanted the story on air Wednesday after Stars and Stripes wrote a story about their online exchange and interviewed Williams and the veterans. “Other news reports began emerging after the story, questioning other Williams statements. Williams has said he saw a body floating in front of his hotel in the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. The New Orleans Advocate pointed out last week that the Quarter was mostly dry and quoted an official questioning his story.” After the Brian Williams scandal broke, Bill O’Reilly became one of Williams’ most vocal opponents. O’Reilly said that other “distortions” from left-leaning media outlets should be questioned. That led one of those left-leaning media outlets, Mother Jones magazine, to investigate Bill O’Reilly’s own claims about his combat experiences. In a 2004 column, O’Reilly said : “Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands War, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash. If that wounded insurgent had a grenade or other explosive device, the entire marine squad and the photographer could be dead right now. In a killing zone, one cannot afford the luxury of knowing what is certain.” Mother Jones investigated Bill O’Reilly’s claims about the Falkland Islands War and reported that O’Reilly’s account had changed over time and had been disputed by other journalists: “Yet his own account of his time in Argentina in his 2001 book, The No Spin Zone, contains no references to O’Reilly experiencing or covering any combat during the Falklands war. In the book, which in part chronicles his troubled stint as a CBS News reporter, O’Reilly reports that he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the Argentine junta surrendered to the British, ending the 10-week war over control of two territories far off the coast of Argentina. There is nothing in this memoir indicating that O’Reilly witnessed the fighting between British and Argentine military forces—or that he got anywhere close to the Falkland Islands, which are 300 miles off Argentina’s shore and about 1,200 miles south of Buenos Aires.” Mother Jones also questioned Bill O’Reilly’s account of reporting on protests in Buenos Aires that followed the Falkland Islands War. O’Reilly reportedly said that a major riot had ensued, protestors were killed in the streets, and that he had to rescue a camera man who had been trampled. Mother Jones reported that O’Reilly’s account of the protest contradicts news coverage from that day, including footage that O’Reilly collected for CBS News, where he worked at the time: “The CBS Evening News that night aired about a minute of video of the protest, apparently including some of the footage that O’Reilly and his camera team had obtained. It showed angry Argentines yelling and denouncing the junta that had lost the war. The only act of violence in the spot was a man throwing a punch against the car of a Canadian news crew.” Billy O’Reilly disputed the accusations on his Fox News show, “The O’Reilly Factor,” on February 20, 2015. O’Reilly stood behind his previous accounts of the Falklands Islands War and said that Mother Jones had twisted his words: “33-years ago in June … Argentina surrendered to Great Britain … ending the Falklands War. “I was covering the conflict from Argentina and Uruguay for CBS News. After learning of the surrender … angry mobs in Buenos Aires … stormed the presidential palace … the Casa Rosada … trying to overthrow the government of General Leopoldo Galtieri. “I was there on the street … with my camera crews. The violence was horrific. … as Argentine soldiers … fired into the crowd … who were responding with violent acts of their own. My video of the combat … led the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather that evening … and later on … I filed a report … that ran nationwide. “That’s what happened. “I never said I was on the Falkland Islands … as (Mother Jones editor David Corn) purports … I said I covered the Falklands War … which I did.” Fox News also released a statement in support of Bill O’Reilly. So, both O’Reilly and Fox News have disputed claims that O’Reilly has a “Brian Williams problem.” Debate about the situation will likely continue from people on both sides of the argument. Brian Williams and NBC News, on the other hand, did not dispute claims that Williams had lied about or embellished his combat zone experiences. ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Bill and Melinda Gates’ Polio Efforts Led to 47,500 Kids Being Paralyzed-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-and-melinda-gates-polio-efforts-paralyzed-47500-kids/"," A polio vaccination campaign headed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in India led to 47,500 cases of paralysis. "," Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio vaccination efforts in India have not paralyzed 47,500 children. The eRumor surfaced in 2013 when the website Nsnbc International published a report that claimed Bill and Melinda Gates hired Bollywood actors to encourage Indians to take an oral polo vaccine in a campaign that went horribly wrong: “Polio is a terrible disease that kills many and paralyzes others. Fifty years ago it was widespread around the world. When you talk to people who remember polio in the United States, they’ll tell you about the fear and panic during an outbreak and describe grim hospital wards full of children in iron lungs that maintained their breathing. At its peak in the United States in 1952, polio paralyzed or killed more than 24,000 people. “But in 2011 alone, the Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio vaccine campaign in India caused 47,500 cases of paralysis and death.” The report goes on to claim that the CDC had “dropped the oral polio vaccine from its vaccine schedule in the U.S. because it was causing polio,” which is true. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has not been used in the U.S. since 2000. The CDC said the risk of paralysis, which effects one out of every 2.4 million children, was too high: “To eliminate the risk of VAPP, as of January 1, 2000, OPV was no longer recommended for routine immunization in the United States. However, OPV continues to be used in the countries where polio is endemic or the risk of importation and transmission is high. OPV is recommended for global polio eradication activities in polio-endemic countries due to its advantages over IPV in providing intestinal immunity and providing secondary spread of the vaccine to unprotected contacts.” The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said that it contributes technical and financial recourses to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to support things like targeted vaccination campaigns, community mobilization and stronger routine immunization efforts: “A cornerstone of the GPEI polio eradication strategy is the goal of reaching all children in the first year of life in the highest-risk countries with multiple doses of OPV, through both national and local vaccination campaigns. Efforts include door-to-door immunization in areas where poliovirus is known or suspected to be circulating, as well as in areas at risk of re-importation, with limited access to healthcare, high population density and mobility, poor sanitation, and low routine immunization coverage… “OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases — 1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine — can cause paralysis. In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population, just like wild polioviruses.” But the eRumor’s central claim — that Bill and Melinda Gates’ polio efforts caused “47,500 cases of paralysis death” — is false. It’s based on an editorial in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics. The editorial said 47,500 new cases of non-polio AFP reported in India in 2011 was “directly proportional” to doses of OPV administered there. The statistic was used to argue the larger point that donor funded “disease-specific” projects should be dropped in favor of community-oriented primary health care programs. But research doesn’t support the editorial’s claims. Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science and the World Health Organization launched a study on the rise of AFP cases in India, and found that a number of factors contributed to it. First, the definition of AFP had been broadened so that weakness and paralysis that result from non-polio viruses now fall under the AFP definition, which led to many more cases being reported. A second factor is that with polio nearly eradicated in India, screenings for non-polio viruses that cause AFP have spiked dramatically, which means that more cases have been identified. According to the study: “This large increase in non-polio AFP cases, which represent AFP cases caused by agents other than poliovirus, probably reflects the excellent implementation of the expanded definition of AFP and highly sensitive surveillance and detection methods used by NPSP in India from 2005 onwards, in contrast to the other polio-endemic countries, i.e., Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan, where the expanded AFP surveillance is not in place. The large increase in the non-polio AFP rate from 1.45 and 1.97 per 100,000 children during 1998–2003 to 16.20 in 2011 further reflects the excellent operational performance of the expanded AFP surveillance in India.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Beneful Dog Food Poisons, Kills Dogs Nationwide- Reported to be Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beneful-dog-food-poisons-and-kills-dogs-nationwide/"," Beneful dog food has killed and poisoned dogs nationwide. "," Reports that Beneful dog food has killed or poisoned dogs across the country have been around for years, but there’s no concrete evidence to back up that claim. The first reports surfaced in 2007 on a forum hosted by the website DoggyBling.com . The website is no longer active. A number of readers reported that their dogs became ill or died after eating Beneful dog food that was tainted with toxic mold. A Florida woman said her Dalmatian mix experienced glazed eyes, white gums, muscle weakness and constipation after eating Beneful, but the dog later recovered. Another woman reported that her dog experienced similar symptoms and died within days of eating Beneful dog food. Purina released a statement in 2007 that said it launched an investigation after reports that two dogs had died after eating Beneful dry dog food. The company said it had found that “the two dogs’ unfortunate deaths were unrelated to our product.” The statement continues: “Importantly, one of the Huntsville, Texas, consumers also requested  product testing through her veterinarian. The veterinarian submitted  a sample of product to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic  Laboratory for aflatoxin analysis. We received confirmation from the  consumer’s veterinarian late Monday, Feb. 5, that the results for  aflatoxin were negative. “Additionally, we have conducted physical inspections and analytical  testing, all of which confirm that our Beneful dry dog food products  are safe, and meet all quality assurance specifications. Purina  initiated the testing, which was conducted by an independent third  party analytical laboratory, as part of its investigation related to  the two Huntsville consumer contacts. As soon as we could contact  the consumers to verify product code and packaging information, we  secured finished product from our factories with the same production  run and date code as the products in question and submitted  the samples for testing. We received test results for the samples  late Monday, Feb. 5, and the results confirmed the safety  and quality of the products made at our factories. More  specifically, the samples showed no presence of aflatoxin.” Aflatoxins are toxic metabolites that are produced by specific types of fungi that can grow in animal feed. They’ve been linked to various diseases in domestic animals, livestock and humans around the world, Cornell University reports . The eRumor resurfaced in 2013 when more dog owners reported that their pets became sick or died after eating Beneful dog food. An Examiner.com contributor posted an article under the headline, “Is Purina’s Beneful dog food killing dogs nationwide; no recall issued by FDA” that fueled speculation. The article reads : “Other owners said that overtime the dog became sicker. Some people  just switched to Beneful for the first time because it is a softer  kibble and noticed an immediate problem. Either way, one common  thread in the reports was the anguish for having bought this  food that injured or killed their beloved pets. “Veterinarians have reported bacterial infections, liver and kidney  failure and high toxins in pets that have been brought in related to  Beneful dog food illnesses.” The article doesn’t name the veterinarians that supposedly found bacterial infections and liver and kidney failure in dogs that ate Beneful dog food. And a common theme begins to develop with this eRumor: scattered accounts from individual dog owners being used to back up the claim that Beneful dog food kills dogs, even though there’s no scientific evidence to support it. Concern among consumers in 2013 led the FDA to launch an investigation into a high-profile case from Pittsburgh. The case involved a 2-year-old English mastiff that had “died mysteriously, of symptoms that looked like poisoning, less than three weeks after she began eating Beneful,” local radio station WPXI reports : “The FDA found that Mazey died of Addison’s disease, an autoimmune  disorder in dogs that can shut down their kidneys. “Investigators blame her death on the disease, not on the Beneful  dog food. I spoke to Carissa and Scott Dority, Mazey’s owners, about  the findings. “It’s a very hard pill to swallow. I was convinced it couldn’t have  been anything other than the dog food,” said Scott Dority of  Cortland, Oh. “The tests also found no evidence of aflatoxin poisoning that can  come from moldy grains. “It’s nice having some closure, knowing exactly what happened and  why,” said Scott Dority. Purina also released a statement that said, “There are no safety or quality issues with Beneful. It’s a high quality, nutritious product that millions of dogs enjoy every day.” ","9-11 Attack on America"
"Sandy Hook Victim Appears in Pakistani School Shooting Vigils – Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sandy-hook-victim-vigils/"," Vigils for the victims of a school massacre in Pakistan in December of 2014 include a picture of a six-year-old boy who was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary two years earlier. "," It’s true that a picture of six-year-old Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner appeared in vigils for students killed in the Army Public School massacre in Peshawar, Pakistan on December 16, 2014. The use of the photo doesn’t, however, prove that Noah Pozner “died twice,” or that the school shootings didn’t happen, as a number of bloggers and websites like LiveLeak.com have claimed : “The school in Pakistan claims Noah Pozner as pupil Huzaifa Huxaifa who died in the Taliban attacks last month!” However, Noah Pozner was much younger than the students who were killed in Peshawar. The victims were in the eighth, ninth and tenth grades, the youngest being 12 years old, CNN reports . The picture of Noah Pozner that appeared in Pakistan was taken when he was six at a book fair held at Sandy Hook Elementary in November of 2012. His grandmother took the photo, and it’s publicly available on the “Remembering Noah Samuel Pozner” Facebook page. Noah’s picture first appeared in a BBC broadcast on the aftermath of the Taliban attack on the Army Public School that left 132 students dead in Peshawar. The video shows Noah’s picture in a montage honoring the dead. But less than a day later, BBC acknowledged that the photo was of Noah Pozner, not a Peshawar victim: “Meanwhile, another picture has been circulating online of victims of the Peshawar massacre — but the montage of images includes the photo of a young boy, Noah Pozner, who died in the Sandy Hook massacre in the United States in 2012.” Another image that made the rounds on the web shows a mourner holding Noah’s picture. It’s not known exactly why mourners used the photo of Noah Pozner in their vigils. It seems they should have been able to recognize that Noah was half the age of the Peshawar victims, so it probably wasn’t a mistake. Mourners may have intentionally used Noah’s image to show solidarity against school massacres around the world, and to highlight that these tragedies happen all over the world, not just in the Middle East. It should also be noted that Noah Pozner has become one of the most well known Sandy Hook victims since his death. Lenny Pozner, Noah’s father, has taken a public stand against Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists, which has incited even more scrutiny. In an editorial that appeared in the Hartford Currant in July 2014, Lenny Pozner wrote: “More than a year and a half after Adam Lanza brutally murdered 26 women and children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, parents and relatives of the victims still relive the terror of that fateful day along with the daily anguish and torment they suffer over the loss of their loved ones. Worse, they have to suffer the onslaught of delusional conspiracy theorists, commonly called hoaxers, who claim Sandy Hook was a ‘false flag’ event concocted by the government as a pretext to gun confiscation. “As a parent of one of the murdered students, Noah Pozner, I have worked to debunk and stop the cruel and hateful hoaxers who use the Internet to spread their lies. Recently, some hoaxers have stepped up the intensity of their twisted campaign in an effort to draw more people into this destructive tale of misinformation and continue to disrupt the lives of victims’ families.” Persistent conspiracy theories and claims about Noah Pozner’s death even led his parents to release a copy of his death certificate and report card. Then, just days before the eRumor claiming that Noah Pozner had “died twice” in separate school shootings went viral in December of 2014, the Pozner family joined a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the guns used by Adam Lanza in the shooting, the Hartford Courant reports : “The wrongful death lawsuit filed at Superior Court in Bridgeport claims that the Bushmaster AR-15 used by Lanza to kill 26 people, including 20 first-graders on Dec. 14, 2012, inside Sandy Hook Elementary School, should not be sold to the public because it is a military assault weapon designed for war. “In addition to Bushmaster, the lawsuit names Camfour, a firearms distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, where Nancy Lanza, the shooter’s mother, purchased the Bushmaster in 2010.” Noah Pozner has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook in the past, and this eRumor appears to be fueled by similar speculation.

Penney said she had been stationed for only a short time as a training officer at Andrews Air Force Base when she and her fellow pilots got the word that terrorists had commandeered commercial aircraft in a planned attack that targeted the Pentagon, a second undetermined site in Washington D.C. and the World Trade Center in New York City. When it was discovered that United Airlines Flight 93 was on a course toward Washington D.C. she said that she and another pilot, Col.

It encourages us to       stop buying from the companies that buy from the Middle East because       that will reduce the support of terrorism. It also suggests that in May of 2001, there was a successful       grass-roots effort to drive down gas prices by boycotting certain       companies. "," There are several issues in this eRumor. First, does the purchase of Middle Eastern oil help terrorism. There are varying voices on that. Some say that since Osama Bin Laden’s family made its money mostly from construction and that Bin Laden has been estranged from the family for quite a while, there isn’t any direct link. Others say that oil purchased from countries like Iraq goes directly toward support of terrorism and that profits for other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, indirectly aid terrorism because of wealthy Saudis who are said to help finance people like Osama Bin Laden. Second, what oil companies buy Middle Eastern oil? We were able to secure the statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy for various oil companies for calendar Year 2000: Shell purchased 3,611,000 barrels from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia BP purchased none from the Middle East. Chevron purchased 14,724,000 from the Middle East. Citgo-None from the Middle East. Amoco purchased 3,611,000 barrels from the Middle East. Exxon-Mobil combined purchased 13,273,000 barrels from the Middle East. Marathon purchased 10,710,000 in Middle Eastern oil. Sunoco purchased none from the Middle East. Conoco purchased 523,000 from the Middle East. Sinclair-We didn’t find any figures. Phillips-We didn’t find any Middle Eastern purchases. Third, was there a successful boycott in 2001? Not really. There have been several emails circulated from time to time that encourage a day or a week of avoiding buying gas, but there’s never been any evidence that we’re aware of that they had had any impact on gas prices. There is one version of this eRumor that adopts some information from another popular eRumor and claims that gas is projected to rise to $3 per gallon by the summer of 2002.  The Energy Department forecast, however, is for a high of $1.60 per gallon.  We have not found any forecasts for $3 per gallon.

The passenger was part of a group of foreign travelers and did have a translator who but he was sitting several rows behind, according to published reports. White also told TruthOrFiction.com that in no way was the passenger suspected of any terrorist plot or activities and that no TSA agents or police officers boarded the plane when it returned to the terminal. According to a report by the NBC News affiliated in Atlanta, GA, here is a chain events that led to the incident of Flight 297: A group of 12 “non-English speaking” passengers and their translator boarded the AirTran flight to Houston in Atlanta. When the plane began to taxi to the runway one of the non-English speakers was spotted by a flight attendant using his cellular phone. His translator was many rows back so was unable to tell the caller of the Federal Aviation Administration rules that requires all electronic devices to be turned off during take off and landing. Not understanding what the flight attendant was saying, the caller continued his conversation. This resulted in the flight attendant alerting the captain of the jetliner, who decided to return the plane to the terminal. Once safely at the terminal, the caller and the translator were asked to exit the aircraft and the rest of the non-English speaking group followed. When the mix-up was all sorted out all members of the group were allowed to return to the aircraft which was still at the terminal. At that time, twelve other passengers who were waiting on the plane “decided they didn’t want to fly on the plane and they all got off.” The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident but nobody was detained and no charges were filed.

"," It’s true that Ted Williams and John Glenn flew   combat missions together in the Korean War. Years before he was inducted into the baseball   hall of fame, Williams was called to active duty as a pilot in the   Korean War. He was dispatched to Korea in 1953 and carried out nearly 40   missions there, MLB.com reports : “He arrived in Korea in    February 1953 as a member of the first Marine Air Wing. It was then    he began his friendship with Glenn. ‘By luck of the draw, we    went to Korea at the same time,’ Glenn said. ‘We were in the same    squadron there. What they did at that time, they teamed up a    reservist with a regular to fly together most of the time just    because the regular Marine pilots normally had more instrument    flying experience and things like that. So Ted and I were scheduled    together. Ted flew as my wingman on about half the missions he flew    in Korea.’ This wasn’t a goodwill    tour. Williams got hit on several occasions, managing to escape    death each time. ‘Once, he was on fire and    had to belly land the plane back in,’ Glenn said. ‘He slid it in on    the belly. It came up the runway about 1,500 feet before he was able    to jump out and run off the wingtip. Another time he was hit in the    wingtip tank when I was flying with him. So he was a very active    combat pilot, and he was an excellent pilot and I give him a lot of    credit.’” The eRumor’s claim about Williams’ role in World   War II also appears to be true. He was drafted into service after the   attack on Pearl Harbor, but he initially received a deferment because   his mother depended on him, MLB.com reports : “This was not portrayed well in the press or    taken well by the fans. He was painted as ‘un-American.’ Fans    heckled him mercilessly. He made it through the 1942 season,    voluntarily enlisting in the Navy reserve and being called to active    duty in November of that year.” Williams would spend the next three years   “studying and learning how to fly.” He excelled as a pilot and set   “still-standing” gunnery records in reflexes, coordination and visual   reaction time, but he was never deployed into combat.

"Social Commentary on Race by Pat Buchanan-Authorship Confirmed!","2015-03-17 17:52:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pat-buchanan-social-commentary-on-race/"," A social commentary penned by Pat Buchanan about race relations in America has appeared in many forwarded emails. "," It’s true that excerpts from this forwarded email   were taken from a column that was posted on Pat Buchanan’s personal   website in 2008. But there are a number of differences between the   eRumor and Buchanan’s original column. The original column appeared under the headline, “A Brief for Whitey,” not under the   headline,“The White Side of the Story of Negroes,” as the eRumor   reports. The eRumor also omitted the original column’s   introduction in an apparent attempt to make it more applicable to   current unrest over Michael Brown’s shooting death in Ferguson,   Missouri, and Eric Gardner’s choking death in New York City. The original   version opens: “How    would he pull it off? I wondered. How would Barack Obama explain to    his press groupies why he sat silent in a pew for 20 years as the    Rev. Jeremiah Wright delivered racist rants against white America    for our maligning of Fidel and Gadhafi, and inveting AIDS to infect    and kill black people? How would he justify not walking out as    Wright spewed his venom about ‘the U.S. of KKK America,’ and howled,    ‘God damn America!’” Taken in its original context, the column was   directed toward controversial   sermons given by Wright that surfaced during the presidential   election in 2008. Still, the majority of the eRumor was excerpted from   Buchanan’s original column, often with slight variations. But the eRumor’s claim that CNN had “dropped”   Buchanan over the column is false. Buchanan worked as a political   analyst for MSNBC from 2002-2012, which is when the column was   published. Buchanan was fired over the release of his book, “Suicide of   a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?” Buchanan said in a 2012   column: “My days    as a political analyst at MSNBC have come to an end. After 10    enjoyable years, I am departing, after an incessant clamor from the    left that to permit me continued access to the microphones of MSNBC    would be an outrage against decency, and dangerous. The calls for my    firing began almost immediately with the Oct. 18 publication of    Suicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?” TruthorFiciton.com reached out to a Buchanan rep for comment on the   social commentary.

The other two were Chimene Okere, who was appointed to serve as special assistant in the Office of Capital Access at the Small Business Administration; and Taylor Dodd, who was appointed to serve as a confidential assistant to the director of the Department of Treasury, according to the university. But a number of bloggers singled out Noor’s appointment because of her Arabic name and an accompanying photo that shows her in traditional Muslim dress, including one video posted on YouTube: “Her name is Arabic. Translated it means, ‘The Daughter of the Profit Mohamed.’ So she’s Muslim, but you knew that by how she was dressed.” The name “Fatima” derives from “Fatimah,” which means, “To abstain” in Arabic, according to the website Behind the Name : “Means ‘to abstain’ in Arabic. Fatimah was a daughter of the Prophet Muhammad and the wife of Ali, the fourth caliph.” Aside from noting her Arabic name and her dress, the eRumor doesn’t include any other claims about Noor that can be investigated.

"," The incident did happen at Bangor International airport on Thursday, November 1, 2001. Nancy Oden does claim that she was singled out because of the Green Party’s views of the war in Afghanistan.  An official statement from the airport says it was not Oden’s political views or activities that resulted in her being scrutinized, but rather the manner in which her ticket was purchased.  They didn’t specify what that meant about her ticket, but under new screening guidelines, a person, for example, who has purchased a ticket on the same day of the flight and used cash to buy it may be selected by computer for additional screening. The airport statement says Oden refused to cooperate with the screening, and that by Federal Regulation, she could not be allowed to board the flight. Susan Libby, one of the screeners on duty on the day of the incident, also says Oden’s views had nothing to do with her being detained.  In a statement from the Bangor, Maine airport website, she says that none of them knew who she was or what her views were.  She says she was bothered by Nancy Oden’s rudeness to the National Guardsmen.

"Michael Moore Called Chris Kyle a Coward – Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michael-moore-called-chris-kyle-a-coward/"," Filmmaker and social commentator Michael Moore tweeted that Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL who inspired the movie “American Sniper,” was a coward. "," It’s true that Michael Moore said he’d been taught that all snipers are cowards, but Moore didn’t directly call Chris Kyle a coward. The claim went viral in January of 2015 after Moore tweeted about the role of snipers on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day: “My uncle was killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren’t heroes. And invaders are worse.” – January 18, 2015 “But if you’re on the roof of your home defending it from invaders who’ve come 7K miles, you are not a sniper, u are brave, u are a neighbor.” -January 18, 2015 Moore’s comments quickly went viral. News outlets like the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline Hollywood reported that the comments were directed toward “American Sniper,” the biopic that details the life Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. According to Deadline Hollywood: The Palme d’Or-winning director of the highest-grossing documentary ever doesn’t seem to like the Clint Eastwood-helmed Oscar nominee nor its subject, Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. In a tweet today, Fahrenheit 9/11 and former AMPAS Governor Michael Moore apparently lashed out at American Sniper and Kyle, who has been credited as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. Moore replied via Facebook that he had made the comments on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day because the civil rights activist had been killed by a sniper. Moore also noted that he made no mention of the movie starring Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle: Lots of talk about snipers this weekend (the holiday weekend of a great man, killed by a sniper), so I thought I’d weigh in with what I was raised to believe about snipers. My dad was in the First Marine Division in the South Pacific in World War II. His brother, my uncle, Lawrence Moore, was an Army paratrooper and was killed by a Japanese sniper 70 years ago next month. My dad always said, “Snipers are cowards. They don’t believe in a fair fight. Like someone coming up from behind you and coldcocking you. Just isn’t right. It’s cowardly to shoot a person in the back. Only a coward will shoot someone who can’t shoot back.” But Deadline Hollywood and the Hollywood Reporter turned that into stories about how I don’t like Clint Eastwood’s new film, “American Sniper.” I didn’t say a word about “American Sniper” in my tweet. The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline Hollywood both issued corrections to clarify that Moore’s original tweets were not directed toward “American Sniper.” Moore was, however, critical of Eastwood’s portrayal of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the film after the eRumor went viral in a Facebook post : If they wanted to know my opinion of “American Sniper” (and I have one), why not ask me? So here’s what I think about “American Sniper”: Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb! Oh… and too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis “savages” throughout the film. But there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there’s a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas — and then used it to kill the man who called himself the ‘America Sniper.’ Moore’s comments about snipers were made directly after “American Sniper” set box office records with more than $100 million in ticket sales on opening weekend. Given that, it would defy logic for Moore to think that general comments about snipers wouldn’t be viewed in light of the wildly popular film, or the life of Chris Kyle. Still, only Moore knows the purpose of his comments, and he didn’t directly call Chris Kyle a coward, as the eRumor claims. ","9-11 Attack on America"

"," This is a hoax, but judging from the emails we’re getting, people want something about it to be true. It is built upon the previously known fact that “NYC” has corresponding symbols in Wingdings that seem to have destructive meaning too. “Q33NY” is not associated in any way with any of the hijacked airliners.  It is not one of the flight numbers.  It is not the tail (registration) number of any of the airplanes (we have the actual tail numbers below), and was not a designation on radar that day, and is not the identity of the subway tunnel leading to the airport or the World Trade Center.  It’s not one of the gate numbers.  With few exceptions, all civilian aircraft in the U.S. have a tail number that begins with “N.”  TruthOrFiction.com has searched the FAA database that includes all airliners and found no airplane with Q33NY or any that begin with “Q” at all.

The “Wingdings” font in Microsoft Word is one that is a collection of symbols rather than letters.  It is true that if you use “Q33NY” in Windings, you’ll get the sequence of symbols suggested but it’s irrelevant.

The eRumor says that a billion dollars is going to be divided by 6,000 victims, or about $167,000 per family.  In reality, the money is going to be spread more broadly.  The funds are not only for those who lost someone in death.  The Chronicle has surveyed some of the organizations and intended destinations of funds.  They include: …Support for immediate family members of firefighters, police officers, and emergency workers who died. …Help for recovery workers with financial or counseling need. …Help for families who are without income because of unemployment that resulted from the attacks. …Help for those who were injured. …Help for funeral and memorial service travel expenses for those who lost family members. …Supplies for relief workers. …Help for charities that experienced losses. …Assistance for small businesses affected. …Help for poor people affected by the attacks. …Costs for treatment of respiratory ailments for those who do not have health insurance coverage. …Support of injured police officers. Regarding the percentages being used by the charities for collecting and processing the funds, that is common.

Costco officials said large candy purchases are not unusual and the authorities caution that there is no reason to believe that these purchases had anything to do with harming children. 10/22/01 ","9-11 Attack on America"
"The album cover that seemed to anticipate the World Trade Center Attack-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/coup/"," The story is that a rap group named The Coup had a new album with a cover painting that looked eerily like the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11.  So much so that the record company pulled it. "," This one is true. It is documented in numerous articles and interviews, but one interview with the group on www.rapstation.com provides a lot of background.  The group is based in Oakland and was about to release a new album titled “Party Music.” The cover for the album pictured the leader of the group, Boots Riley, holding a detonator and the World Trade Center blowing up in the background.  Although there isn’t anything like jetliners flying into buildings, the scene of smoke coming from near the top floors of the trade center looked as though they could have been patterned after the actual attacks.  The album was to have been distributed by Warner Brothers, who pulled it very quickly after the terrorist attacks. Click here to see the Wired News story and a picture of the album cover. Boots Riley says the picture for the album was created in May or June of 2001.  Riley is well known for ranting against capitalism and the album cover was supposed to symbolize his fight against it.  He says, however, that he wants to make it clear that he does not endorse what happened at the World Trade Center on September 11.  He doesn’t advocate defeating capitalism by blowing up buildings.
