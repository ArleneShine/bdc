"Woman Poops on Boss’s Desk After Winning the Lottery-Fiction!","2016-04-27 14:19:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/woman-poops-bosss-desk-winning-lottery/"," Reports that a lucky woman who won the lottery quit her job by pooping on her boss’s desk have gone viral. "," False reports about a woman pooping on her boss’s desk started with a fake news website. The Valley Report started the rumor with a story that appeared under the headline, “Woman Arrested for Defecating on Boss’ Desk After Winning the Lottery.” The story reports that a 41-year-old woman delivered her unpleasant resignation from a courier company after winning $3 million in the lottery: The courier company had no idea of her winnings. “I knew something was wrong because I came back from lunch and the door to my office was closed,” said the manager. I slowly opened the door to discover the woman with her pants around her ankles, hunched over on my desk like a hippopotamus/cheetah dropping a massive poo on my desk. She shot her head towards me and locked eyes. I was frozen in shock and fear. In my peripheral vision I saw a huge mud-monkey sliming out of her butt like a Play-Doh fun factory.” “It was worth it,” the woman said on arrest. “On Friday when I realized I hit the lotto, I knew this would be the first thing I would do. I hit up every Mexican food truck and saved my dumps all weekend. I was shuffling around like a death-row inmate trying not to explode. I’ve been putting up with that guy’s shit for years, it’s time he put up with some of mine.” Within days of being posted in April 2016, the story had been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook. Hundreds of comments poured in, some applauding her resignation — and others blasting it. However, The Valley Report disclaimer says its stories “may be exaggerated, embellished or an outright work of fiction,” so it’s not a reputable source of news. ","Humorous"

"," Reports that two cops from Georgia have killed 250 people in the line of duty appear to stem from a joke that went over the heads of many. The rumor started with a post that appeared on the “ Cop-Block ” Facebook community page. The group bills itself as being against police corruption and violent tactics. Someone posted a picture of two (fictional) cops that appear in A&E’s “The Walking Dead” show about a zombie apocalypse. The post claims that the two cops had killed 250 people in the line of duty: THIS IS HUGE!!! Why isn’t the mainstream media covering this? This is real brutality! When is the violence going to stop, people? These two officers in Georgia have killed over 250 people in the line of duty. They were best friends in high school and entered the police academy together only to fuel a more sinister and sexually devious lifestyle than anyone could predict… That, of course, follows the story of Shane and Rick, two cops from “The Walking Dead” who are pictured in the photo. The two started out as best friends but morphed into mortal enemies as the zombie apocalypse progressed. Some people missed the joke, and others were upset that someone had made light of police brutality. Either way, this one is fiction. ","Humorous"

"Michael J. Fox Arrested for Insider Sports Betting-Fiction!","2015-10-23 10:29:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michael-j-fox-arrested-for-insider-sports-betting/"," Reports that are eerily similar to the plot of “Back to the Future II” claim that Michael J. Fox has been arrested for insider sports betting. "," Don’t believe stories about Michael J. Fox being arrested for insider sports betting. The rumor started out as a joke about Back to the Future II, but lots of people missed the punch line. In the movie, Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) travels to the future — October 21, 2015, to be exact — to prevent his nemesis, Biff Tennan, from making millions on insider sports betting. Tennan had somehow got his hands on “a sports almanac from the future” and used it to place insider sports bets during the eighties. Because Marty McFly time traveled to October 21, 2015, in the movie, the date was celebrated (in real life) as “Back to the Future Day.” The false report about Michael J. Fox being arrested for sport betting, a parody of the movie’s plot, was part of that. The fake news website Stubhill News played a big role in the rumor going viral. The site reported that Michael J. Fox had been arrested for inside betting on the DraftKings daily fantasy sports website: Los Angeles—Michael J. Fox was arrested Wednesday morning in relation to insider sports betting on DraftKings. Fox aroused suspicion after achieving a statistically-impossible, perfect record on the site under the username NoChicken. Authorities found an unusually worn copy of a sports almanac which was just recently printed and which has markings cataloging winning bets Fox has placed since the late 80’s. “The operating theory is that the Back to the Future films were really documentaries from an original, prime timeline,” said NASA astrophysicist Barry Manilow. “The implications are heavy. It is suspected that we are living in an alternate 2015, as there are no flying cars and there are only four Jaws movies. We can only assume that we are forever stunted as a society. The amount of lives lost due to our lack of progress in technology and medicine is unfathomable. Worst of all, instead of hoverboards, this sad reality is limited to the Swagway.” But rest assured, Michael J. Fox has not been arrested for insider sports betting. ","Humorous"
"Dr. Ben Carson Loses Medical License Because of “Brainless Comments”-Fiction!","2015-10-16 11:19:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dr-ben-carson-loses-medical-license-because-of-brainless-comments/"," Dr. Ben Carson has had his medical license revoked in all 50 states after making “brainless comments” on the campaign trail in his pursuit of the GOP presidential nomination. "," False reports that Dr. Ben Carson had lost his medical license because of comments that he made on the campaign trail have been fueled by a satirical story published by the Huffington Post . The story appeared under the headline, “Ben Carson Loses Brain Surgeon License After Making Numerous Brainless Comments,” had been shared on social media sites more than 17,000 times within days of its publication: The Medical Boards for all 50 States in the Union announced today that they have revoked Ben Carson’s medical license and will no longer allow him to operate as a brain surgeon any where in the U.S. And they cited as their reason Carson’s mental and intellectual challenges — otherwise known as the propensity to sound like a total and utter nutcase. In a joint statement, the Medical Boards said: We have been increasingly concerned about the gibberish emanating from Mr. Carson’s cerebrum. We cite by way of example his belief that the holocaust could have been prevented by armed German citizens, that straight people go into prison and come out gay, and that Obamacare is the worse thing to happen to the country since slavery. We are therefore suspending his medical license in any state where he is qualified to practice. And should he choose to come out of retirement and re-apply for credentials, we will not allow him to operate on people’s cerebrums, or indeed cerebullums, limbic systems and brain stems, until he can demonstrate that his own are in fully working order.” The story appeared in the “comedy” section of the Huffington Post website, but that was lost on many who followed a direct link to the story and were unaware that it was published as political satire. But, in reality, the scenario that the (fake) news report outlines for Ben Carson to lose his medical license isn’t possible. State licensing boards don’t decide who can perform brain surgery — individual hospitals do, according to a CATO Institute report : …In the United States, state licensing boards do not decide who actually conducts brain surgery. Medical licensing is not specialty-specific; licenses are given to graduates of medical school who have passed a comprehensive exam. They are not evaluated for specialty-related training, skills, or experience. Instead of government-sanctioned licensing boards, hospitals decide who may practice neurosurgery. Members of a hospital’s medical staff credential and privilege medical professionals, determining exactly what an individual may do. They verify and evaluate the education, skills, experience, malpractice history, and competency of each individual medical professional before the individual is granted the right to perform specific tasks. Health maintenance organizations go through much the same procedure, verifying a wide range of background information when they establish networks or panels of physicians from whom patients may seek care. They do this because they might be held liable for a mistake made by a credentialed care provider, and because their reputations matter… So, even if medical boards in all 50 states wanted to revoke Ben Carson’s medical license to perform brain surgeries (which they don’t), they wouldn’t be able to.

Gabe Gabriel says this tale has existed since shortly after World War II but that history does not support the claims of the story.  The Roman ruts, according to Gabriel, were not for chariots but for narrow, hand-pulled carts.  Although there are many places where the ruts are visible, Gabriel questions that they played a role in English railroad standards 1400 years after the last Roman legions.  One of the claims of the eRumor is that the width of the ruts was affected by the need to make the chariot and it’s wheels the same width as the combined rears of the horses pulling them.  Gabriel says there’s a statue by Franzoni in the Vatican museum that is regarded as the most accurate known depiction of a Roman chariot.  The two horses are wider than the chariot and the chariot wheels behind them. Where did the four-foot, eight-and-a-half-inch standard originate?  Gabriel says it was from a Englishman named George Stephenson.  Carts on rails had been used in mines in England for years, but the width of the rails varied from mine to mine since they didn’t share tracks.  Stephenson was the one who started experimenting with putting a steam engine on the carts so there would be propulsion to pull them along.  He had worked with several mines with differing gauges and simply chose to make the rails for his project 4-foot, eight inches wide.  He later decided that adding another six inches made things easier.  He was later consulted for constructing some rails along a roadway and by the time broader plans for railroads in Great Britain were proposed, there were already 1200 miles of his rails so the “Stephenson gauge” became the standard. Interestingly, the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch width has not always been the standard in the U.S.  According to the Encyclopedia of American Business History and Biography, at the beginning of the Civil War, there were more than 20 different gauges ranging from 3 to 6 feet, although the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch was the most widely used.  During the war, any supplies transported by rail had to be transferred by hand whenever a car on one gauge encountered track of another gauge and more than 4,000 miles of new track was laid during the war to standardize the process.  Later, Congress decreed that the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch standard would be used for transcontinental railway. updated 5/30/02 ","Humorous"

In 2002 there was conflict between parents and school authorities at       Pacific Palisades Charter High School over an attendance policy. The school is a part of Palisades Charter Schools, which operate       under the Los Angeles Unified School District, but independently. The school tried to crack down on absences by deciding that any       unexcused absences of ten or more days per tem would result in       automatic failure for the student. A result was that during the first term of 2002, more than a hundred       students who had otherwise passing grades were flunked because of       absences and tardies. The parents cried foul. They said they had not know about the policy and some threatened to       take the issue to court. Then the Los Angeles Unified School District got into the fray by       saying that since the attendance policy had not been cleared with       them, the failing grades would have to be set aside. The school disagreed, saying it had the privilege of operating       autonomously because of being a charter school. In the midst of that, someone created the fictional answering       machine message, which has circulated ever since as a monument of       what teachers and administrators would like to be able to say to       some parents.

"Live on a Cruise Liner rather than a Retirement Facility?-Speculation!& Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cruiseretire/"," Summary of the benefits of spending your retirement money living on a cruise ship instead of a retirement home. "," An email comparison living on a cruise ship with living in a retirement facility has circulated on the Internet for quite a while. It was mostly speculative and humorous. Then versions started circulating saying that the writer had actually met someone on a cruise who was living aboard the ship and paying for repeated cruises instead of living on land. We’ve not found the source of the original email or anybody who has actually had the experience stumbling across a retired person who has elected to live as a cruse ship passenger because it was cheaper than living on land. The idea, however, is not complete fiction. Two experts on elder care from the Northwestern University School of Medicine have evaluated the idea and their thoughts were published in the November issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Then there’s the story of 86-year-old Bea Muller of Florida. Her husband died aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 while on a world cruise in 2000. Face with moving back home to live alone in a retirement center, she decided to sell everything and book herself onto the ship one year at a time. She’s been doing that ever since, even after the Queen Elizabeth 2 stopped doing trans-Atlantic crossings and operating only in Europe. She is said to still dance each night away with her constantly rotating clusters of new friends. Last updated 1-28-05 About 2 years ago we were on a cruise through the western Mediterranean aboard a Princess liner. At dinner we noticed an elderly lady sitting alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the main     dining room. I also noticed that all the staff, ships officers, waiters,     busboys, etc., all seemed very familiar with this lady. I asked our waiter whom     the lady was expecting to be told she owned the line, but he said he only     knew that she had been on board for the last four cruises, back to back. As we left the dining room one evening I caught her     eye and stopped to say hello. We chatted and I said, “I understand you’ve been on this     ship for the last four cruises”. She replied, “Yes, that’s     true.” I stated, “I don’t understand?” She replied without a pause, “It’s cheaper than a     nursing home”. Here’s the proof — when I get old and feeble, I am     going to get on a Princess Cruise Ship. The average cost for a nursing home is $200 per day. I     have checked on reservations at Princess and I can get a long term discount and senior discount price of $135 per day. That leaves $65 a day for: 1. Gratuities which will only be $10 per day. 2. I will have as many as 10 meals a day if I can     waddle to the restaurant, or I can have room service (which means I can have breakfast     in bed every day of the week). 3. Princess has as many as three swimming pools, a     workout room, free washers and dryers, and shows every night. 4. They have free toothpaste and razors, and free soap     and shampoo. 5. They will even treat you like a customer, not a     patient. An extra $5 worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. 6. I will get to meet new people every 7 or 14 days. 7. TV broken? Light bulb need changing? Need to have     the mattress replaced? No Problem! They will fix everything and apologize for your inconvenience. 8. Clean sheets and towels every day, and you don’t     even have to ask for them. 9. If you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you     are on Medicare. If you fall and break a hip on the Princess ship they will upgrade you     to a suite for the rest of your life. Now hold on for the best! Do you want to see South     America, the Panama Canal, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, or name where you want to     go? Princess will have a ship ready to go. So don’t look for me in a nursing home, just call shore to ship. P. S. And don’t forget, when you die, they just dump     you over the side at no charge. ","Humorous"

"Buy beer and recycle the cans instead of buying some stocks-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beer-stocks/"," In a unique argument to buy beer instead of stocks, the eRumor says that $1,000 invested a year ago in Enron, Worldcom, and Nortel would have been worth only about $5 to $50.  But buying $1,000 of Budweiser and recycling the cans in the state of Maine would have resulted in more than $200. "," It depends on what months the writer of the eRumor was comparing for the three stocks, but according to our figures, the Budweiser would have been a lot better investment than Enron, but not as valuable as Worldcom or Nortel.  Also, we could not find facts to support the conclusion that $1,000 worth of recycled Budweiser cans would have brought $214. Here are some of the details assuming the eRumor started circulating in June: Enron Was about $54 per share in June of 2001 so $1,000 would have purchased about 19 shares.  By June of 2002, the price was about 16 cents per share so the $1,000 investment would be worth about $3. Nortel Was about $14 per share in June of 2001 so $1,000 would have purchased about 71 shares.  By June of 2002, the price was about $1.60 per share so the $1,000 investment would be worth about $114. Worldcom Was about $18 per share in June of 2001 so $1,00 would have purchased about 56 shares.  By June of 2002, the price was about $1.41 per share so the $1,000 investment would be worth about $79. The Budweiser Beer Can Index According to a 711 and Bangor and a market in Augusta, the price of a can of beer in Maine is between $1.00 and $1.10.  That means that $1,000 would buy between 900 and 1,000 cans of Budweiser.  The writer of the eRumor says those cans would be worth $214 if recycled at 10 cents per pound, which is 2,140 pounds of cans.  We didn’t find how many beer cans can be crushed into a pound of recycled aluminum but a manufacturers group says that a pound of aluminum can be used to make 34 cans. The number of cans per recycled pound would be a lot less.  Using 34 cans as the measurement, however, means that 900 to 1000 cans would result in 26 to 30 pounds or about $2.60 to $3.00 worth at 10 cents per pound.  We checked with a couple of recycling centers in Maine who said that in August, 2002, the price per pound of recycled aluminum was 27 cents per pound so the value of the 26 to 30 pounds would be between $7 and $8.  It’s all academic, however, because most recyclers don’t accept aluminum cans, only other kinds of scrap aluminum.  In Maine, however, bottles and cans can be redeemed at local stores for five cents per unit so the $1000 worth of Budweiser cans would be worth between $45 and $50.   That’s better than putting the $1,000 into Enron a year earlier and not as good as having invested it in the Worldcom and Nortel stocks.

The first example in the eRumor alleged that actor, and President Lincoln assassin, John Wilkes Booth was a member of theDemocratic party. Booth was a member of the Know Nothing Party. Charles J. Guiteau, the man who shot and killed President James Garfield was a Republican. He wrote a speech for James Garfield. Guiteau shot Garfield because the president did not appoint him as an ambassador. Not much is known about the political affiliations of John Hinckley, Jr., who attempted to kill President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, but there was a Bush connection with the family. Hinkley’s father was a financial supporter of the campaign of George H. W. Bush when he ran for office in 1980. Also, Hinkley’s father, Scott, was scheduled to have dinner with Neil Bush, the son of the vice president, on the day after the attempted assassination of President Reagan. The McDonalds mass murderer was committed by James Huberty not James Hubert, as noted in the eRumor. We found no evidence that he was a Democrat. Huberty’s online biographies indicated that he was a survivalist and obsessed with Soviet agression. He believed in an impending breakdown of society, economic collapse, and that he was in the advent of a nuclear war. Because of this he had invested in non-perishable foods and an arsenal of weapons. Larry Ashbrook, not Larry Asbrook, was the man who killed seven people attending a concert by Christian rock group Forty Days at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. No political affiliation was found. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, was a immigrant from South Korea.

It is not clear what   date the eRumor was first circulated so it’s hard to know what actual   figures, if any, the writer was using for the 22-month comparison but   here is the best we can come up with: The total U.S. war   casualties referenced in the eRumor is 2112. That would mean that   the probable date of those figures would be November, 2005 when,   according to month-by-month figures the casualties in Iraq reached 2113. We’re not sure why the   writer chose to refer to that as a 22 month count because from the   beginning of the war in March, 2003 to November, 2005, was actually   about 30 months and that’s the period of time it took to reach a   casualty count of 2113. For approximately the   same period, the number of gun-related deaths in Washington DC was 464.   The population of Washington DC during that same period averaged about   560,000, for a rate of deaths per 100,000 of about 82. The eRumor’s   calculation of the death rate in Iraq , however, is incorrect. It’s not   60 per 100,000. It’s 1,320 per 100,000. Additionally, the   death rate of U.S. soldiers in Iraq has not been just “gun related.”   Many have been killed in other ways such as through roadside bombs.

The folks at TruthOrFiction.com have been looking into cow tipping since the first time it was brought to our attention in the early 1980’s.  Although there is occasionally someone who swears to have participated in it or seen it, we have not found any credible evidence that it exists. Further, the cow experts we’ve checked with say that although it’s possible that somebody somewhere has toppled a cow, especially a young one, the logistics of cow tipping argue against it being a routine occurrence.  Adult cows weigh several hundred pounds and are built low to the ground.  They have a low center of gravity.  Pushing one of them over would take a lot of muscle power.  That’s if you could get near enough to pull it off. Rich Buhler, the founder of TruthOrFiction.com, is from cattle country in Arizona and says that even though cows have the reputation of being slow, they are actually very aware and very smart and and that it would be tough for someone to sneak up on one, especially at night.  He also says that cows do not sleep standing up. Sara Brantmeier, editor of America’s largest dairy industry magazine, told the Charleston Gazette in June, 2001, that cow tipping is a myth and the whole idea is stupid, but humorous.  TruthOrFiction.com contacted her and she confirmed that cows do not sleep while standing up and she’s never known of any authentic cow tipping.","Humorous"

Fineman says Mr. Bush briefed them on plans for action against the terrorists and said, ““When I take action, I’m not going to fire a $2 million missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt. It’s going to be decisive.” ","Humorous"
