"Warnings About Shark Finning-Truth!","2016-08-17 14:53:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/warnings-shark-finning-truth/"," The practice of shark finning involves fisherman cutting off shark fins and dumping their carcasses back into the ocean. "," Shark finning is a phenomenon that leads to the deaths of countless sharks each year and threatens ocean ecosystems. The practice of shark finning involves fisherman catching various shark species, cutting off their dorsal fin, and dumping the carcasses back into the water to die. One of the driving forces of shark finning has been the historic significance of shark fin soup in China. Chinese empowers once believet hat the dish had healing power and represented the triumph of man over beast, the Smithsonian Ocean Portal reports : In the past, Chinese Emperors favored the soup as a dish that honored guests because it was thought to have medicinal benefits and represented a victory against powerful sharks. This popularity has not faded with time, and has even expanded with China’s growing population. Today shark fin soup is still prevalent and has become a staple for more than just emperors on special occasions. As a result, fishermen have a large incentive to gather and sell shark fins. Because shark fins are far more valuable than other parts of the shark, fisherman routinely dump the less valuable shark carcasses back into the ocean to save room on their boats for the more valuable commodity, National Geographic reports : It will cost countries money to monitor the international trade in shark fins. But keep in mind that fins are a luxury product that fetch exorbitant prices. We saw one set of large great hammerhead fins on sale in Bangkok that was advertised for USD$1,100 per kilogram (about $500 per pound). Shark fin soup was selling for $365 a bowl at a nearby restaurant. There is money in this trade that could and should be redirected towards ensuring compliance with the new international law and promoting sustainability. Overall, researchers believe that humans kill more than 100 million sharks each year, which endangers the species and threatens to imbalance the ocean’s ecosystems since sharks play an important role in them. However, there is some good news. A government frugality drive and public awareness campaigns in China had led to a 70 percent decrease in fin soup consumption by 2014, the nonprofit WildAid reports : Prices of shark fin are falling in China by 50 percent-70 percent and sales have decreased by 82 percent according to a new report released last week by WildAid. “Evidence of Declines in Shark Fin Demand, China” compiles public opinion surveys, surveys of shark find vendors and traders in the markets of Guangzhou, China (the current center of China’s shark fin trade) and surveys of shark fin price data from Indonesian shark fishermen, as well trade statistics and media reports. The report also found rising public awareness with 85 percent of Chinese consumers surveyed online saying that they had given up shark fin soup within the last three years. Two-thirds of these respondents cited awareness campaigns as a reason for ending their shark fin consumption, while the second and third most popular reason given were that they “want to protect sharks” and that it is “cruel the way they kill sharks” — key messages of WildAid’s ongoing public awareness campaign. Similar steps have followed in the U.S. Legislation that would ban the trade of shark fins in the country was introduced in June 2016. Even though shark finning is illegal in U.S. waters, shark fins are routinely bought and sold in the country. The bill would make that illegal, nonprofit Ocean reports : Oceana also released a new report today demonstrating why Congress needs to pass a federal ban on the buying and selling of shark fin products. The demand for shark fins is one of the greatest threats facing shark populations around the world.  In fact, fins from as many as 73 million sharks end up in the global market every year. According to the new report, a nationwide ban on the trade of shark fins would reduce the international fin trade, improve enforcement of the current finning ban, and send a message to other countries that the United States recognizes shark finning as a cruel process that should not be allowed to continue. “Shark finning is cruel and wasteful and it’s putting some shark species at risk of extinction. The United States rightly decided to ban the trade of ivory and rhino horns—yet we still import shark fins, which can be the result of an equally brutal practice,” said Lora Snyder, campaign director at Oceana. “To protect sharks, we need to end the demand for shark fins. Today, the United States took an important step towards achieving this. We applaud the leadership of the bill’s supporters today in helping to end the shark fin trade in the United States.” ","Animals"
"Ligers Are Biggest Cats in the World-Truth!","2016-08-17 14:31:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ligers-biggest-cats-world/"," A cross between a lion and a tiger, a liger, is the largest and possibly most dangerous cat in the world. "," Most of what you’ve heard about ligers is true — but breeding practices that result in these big cat hybrids are considered by many to be immoral and unethical. First and foremost, tigers and lions do not naturally breed with each other in the wild. The nonprofit Big Cat Rescue says that lions and tigers don’t coexist in the same areas of the wild, so crossbreeding is not something that happens naturally. Instead, ligers (the result of breeding a male lion to a tigress) and tigons (the result of breeding a male tiger to a lioness) occurs in captivity, most often for amusement. But often, the results aren’t pretty, Big Cat Rescue says: These cats suffer from many birth defects and usually die young. Because ligers are usually larger than either parent, it also puts the tigress at great risk in carrying the young and may require C-section deliveries or kill her in the process. When the public quits paying to see these unfortunate creatures, the evil people responsible for breeding them will stop this inhumane practice. Slate reported on the growing trend of breeding hybrid curiosities — zonkies, ligers, zebroids, just to name a few — and reported that ligers’ hearts and organs often can’t handle the weight of their enormous bodies, which leads to disability or death. And, while ligers are typically much larger than both of their parents, tigons are typically smaller. When standing on their hind legs, ligers can measure up to 12 feet tall, and they can weigh up to 1,000 pounds. To compare, average male lions typically weigh about 420 pounds and measure a little more than six feet long. So it’s true that ligers are the biggest cats in the world — but they are the result of highly questionable breeding practices.","Animals"

"," A fake news website is behind this tall tale. The story appeared on the fake news website Not Allowed To under the headline, “3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes.” The story, which was quickly shared nearly 20,000 times on social media, begins: Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning. Canadian tourist, John O’Keef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. “We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.

"Obama Replaces Bald Eagle with Buffalo As Symbol of America-Fiction!","2016-05-05 10:18:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-replaces-bald-eagle-buffalo-symbol-america/"," Reports that President Obama has ordered that the buffalo should replace the bald eagle as America’s national symbol. "," The buffalo has been designated as America’s national mammal — but President Obama didn’t “replace” the bald eagle with the buffalo as America’s national symbol. Those rumors started with a report that appeared at American News under the headline, “Obama to Replace National Bird the Bald Eagle with THIS.” The story reports : According to recent reports, our nation is about to get a new animal—and it’s quite a departure from the bald eagle, which has been the sole symbol of the United States for 234 years. Reports indicate that the National Bison Legacy Act has just been passed by Congress, and is expected to pass through the Senate next week. The act denotes the bison as America’s national mammal and a “historical symbol of the United States.” The eagle will reportedly still represent the nation, but it will no longer be the sole animal doing so. If passed, the bison will join the bald eagle, the oak, and the rose as a symbol for our country. The story isn’t factually incorrect, but its headline and overall tone have led readers to believe that the bald eagle has been outright replaced by the buffalo, which is not the case. Congress passed the National Bison Legacy Act in April 2016, which designates the buffalo as America’s national mammal. The legislation states that bison are a “historical symbol of the United States” and that the animal was” integrally linked with the economic and spiritual lives of many Indian tribes through trade and sacred ceremonies.” The bill, which was waiting for President Obama’s signature to become law when the rumor went viral, does nothing to change the bald eagle’s status as an American symbol. That’s why we’re calling this one fiction. ","Animals"
"Social Media Posts Make Claims About Veal Crates-Fiction!","2016-03-31 08:03:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/social-media-posts-make-claims-veal-crates/"," Viral videos and social media posts that claim to show pictures of veal crates that calves are stored in to limit their mobility and keep their meat tender have been circulating for years. "," There are plenty of valid arguments about the treatment of veal calves, but these posts and videos do not show “veal crates.” Claims about veal crates have been in widespread circulation among animal rights activists and their supports since 2014. That year, a YouTube video tilted “Baby Calves in Veal Crates” was posted, and a Facebook post showing an image of rows upon rows of so-called veal crates began making the rounds: There’s a big problem with these claims, however. The images and videos show pictures of calf hutches, not veal crates. These little plastic huts are filled with hay and provide a small fenced in grass area for calves to enjoy — which is pretty posh considering how veal calves are treated: So, female calves that will grow up to become milk producers are given the luxury of calf hutches. The vast majority of male calves, on the other hand, are slaughtered and processed into veal at about four months of age because they’re unable to produce milk, rendering them worthless to dairy farmers. Veal calves are kept in stanchions in veal barns that limit their mobility and prevent them from getting exercise that toughens their meat into muscle: Animal rights advocates have long called the practice of raising veal calves inhumane. From the dairy industry prospective, however, this setup allows veal calves to receive individualized care and for their eating to be closely monitored, the USDA reports : Today’s modern, environmentally controlled veal barns provide for animal health and safety. The barns are lighted artificially and by natural light, and a constant source of fresh air is circulated. Individual stalls are used for each calf. These stalls provide a safe environment where the calves can stand, stretch, groom themselves and lay down in a natural position. These pens are invaluable to the health of the animal. They allow the calves to be individually looked after. The stall’s slotted floors allow for efficient removal of waste. …Individual stalls allow veal farmers and veterinarians to closely monitor the health of each calf and properly treat a calf with a specific, government approved antibiotic. Veal farmers monitor each calf for health deficiencies such as anemia. The feed is controlled to meet the calves’ iron needs. Health products for use with veal calves are approved by the Food and Drug Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services before being put on the market. The FDA also regulates information on the labeling of the product, the doses permitted, and withdrawal period. So, again, there are plenty of valid questions about raising veal calves — but these social media posts of so-called “veal crates” undercut them. That’s why we’re calling this one fiction.

"BHA in Milk-Bone Dog Treats Causes Cancer-Unproven!","2016-03-25 12:51:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bha-milk-bone-dog-treats-causes-cancer/"," Claims that Milk-Bone brand dog treats contain BPH, a preservative allegedly known to cause cancer, have gone viral. "," Claims that Milk-Bone and other dog treats contain cancer-causing BHA aren’t new — and they are haven’t been proven true, either. Panic that Milk-Bone and Beggin Strips, the two most popular dog treat brands in the nation, cause cancer have been floating around the web since at least 2010. Back then, a WordPress site called Good Stuff For Dogs warned that these dog treats contain a number of toxins, including the preservative butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Then, the claim went viral again in March 2016 when a Facebook community page called “Planet Paws” repeated the claim in a video that was quickly viewed 15 million times: On its face, that claim has some merit. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) study found that there was “sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity” when BHA was added to the diets of lab rats and hamsters. And the California State Regulatory Program lists BHA on its list of Known Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxins . However, the FDA allows BHA to be added to human food (and dog treats) at certain levels and classifies the preservative as “generally regarded as safe.” The idea is that although BHA might cause cancer in lab rats, its metabolized differently by other animals —humans and dogs in particular — and it’s used in foods at amounts well below levels that would cause problems. Still, the FDA concedes that more research is needed : While no evidence in the available information on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) demonstrates a hazard to the public when it is used at levels that are now current and in the manner now practiced, uncertainties exist requiring that additional studies be conducted. For its part, Milk-Bone has responded to customer concerns on Facebook by saying that BHA has been recognized as safe by the FDA, and that “very small amounts of BHA” are added to Milk-Bone treats to preserve fats and prevent staleness: So, after years of speculation about whether or not BHA is a cancer-causing preservative, the jury is still out. The FDA has acknowledged that more research is need, but it considers BHA generally safe for both humans and dogs. That’s why we’re calling this claim unproven. ","Animals"
"Opossums Kill Ticks, Help Stop the Spread of Lyme Disease-Mostly Truth!","2016-03-23 13:19:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/opossums-kill-ticks-help-stop-spread-lyme-disease/"," Opossums stop the spread of Lyme disease because they kill up to 4,000 ticks a week. "," Claims about possums and ticks are mostly true — but the amount of ticks one possum kills in a week has been skewed. An “Awesome Possum” meme, as it has become known, was posted at the image-sharing community website FunnyJunk.com in mid-March. Within days, it had been shared thousands of times on Facebook, and the legend of the Awesome Possum was born: INSERT PIC The idea is that even though possums are scary looking scavengers that prowl in the night for animal carcasses to feed on, they actually serve an important purpose: preventing the spread of Lyme disease by “hoovering up and killing” up to 4,000 ticks a week, each. As it turns out, there’s scientific evidence to support the “Awesome Possum” claim. It comes from Richard Ostfeld of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. The Cary Institute reports : And now ecologists have learned something else about opossums. They’re a sort of magnet when it comes to riding the world of black-legged ticks, which spread Lyme disease. “Don’t hit opossums if they’ve playing dead in the road,” said Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. Ostfeld is forest ecologist and an expert on the environmental elements of infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Several years ago, scientists decided to learn about the part different mammals play in the spread of the ticks and the disease. They tested six species — white-footed mice, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums and veerys and catbirds — by capturing and caging them, and then exposing each test subject to 100 ticks. What they found, is that of the six, the opossums were remarkably good at getting rid of the ticks — much more so that any of the others. “I had no suspicion they’d be such efficient tick-killing animals,” Ostfeld said. Indeed, among other opossum traits, there is this: They groom themselves fastidiously, like cats. If they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it. (The research team on the project went through droppings to find this out. All praise to those who study possum poop.) Extrapolating from their findings, Ostfeld said, the team estimated that in one season, an opossum can kill about 5,000 ticks. So, it’s true that ticks are very good at removing and eating ticks — but not quite as good as the Awesome Possum meme claims. Researchers estimated that one possum could kill about 5,000 ticks in one season — not 4,000 ticks in one year. And the idea that possums stop the spread of Lyme disease is based on a simple cause-and-effect theory: possums help stop the spread of Lyme disease by killing ticks, which carry the disease. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly true. ","Animals"
"Nylabone Dog Treats Are Toxic and Cause Seizures-Reported as Fiction!","2016-03-15 08:24:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nylabone-dog-treats-toxic-cause-seizures/"," A viral Facebook post warns that Nylabone dog treats are toxic and can cause seizures.

Those rumors surfaced with a Facebook post from a woman who said she was passing along a message “from a friend” about her 2 year-old dog having a seizure while eating a Nylabone dog chew: It’s true that chicken flavored Nylabone FlexiChew Bones are “not recommended for strong chewers.” That doesn’t mean they’re toxic or can cause seizures, however. Rather, according to the company’s chew style guidelines, its bones are formulated for specific chewing styles to prevent damage to dogs’ teeth, and to prevent dogs from being able to bite off and swallow large pieces: Get to know your dog’s chewing style – It is important to select the appropriate chew type, size, and formulation based on your dog’s age, breed, chewing style and weight. The pressure exerted by a dog’s jaw is considerable, and when directed straight down can put tremendous stress on their teeth. It is recommended that non-edible chews be large enough to encourage chewing from the side rather than the top and bottom. If your dog is between sizes, choose the larger-size chew item. If you have more than one dog in your household, select chews appropriate for the largest, strongest chewer. If your dog is an especially strong chewer, a larger chew may provide more of a challenge. Nylabone product warnings state that dog owners should call a veterinarian if a dog swallows a large piece of a bone, but there’s been no indication that that would cause seizures. The Canine Journal reports that Nylabones are made from compounds that are very difficult for dogs to digest, which can cause blockage or other severe medical problems: If your dog has eaten part of a Nylabone, you need to go to the vet immediately! The components of a these bones are very difficult for your dog to digest and can cause many problems, not only to your pup’s health but also to your bank account. It’s important to watch your dog and check his toys each time before giving them to him to make sure the toys are still in good condition and that there aren’t any pieces missing. If your dog swallows a large piece of Nylabone or other chew toy you may have to get an x-ray, have him stay overnight at the vet’s, have him undergo expensive emergency surgery or worse. For its part, Nylabone released a statement calling accusations that its products are toxic and cause seizures incorrect: Recently there has been some misinformation about the safety of our products circulating on Facebook. The negative information—mostly originating from and being spread by fake spam accounts—is incorrect, and we would like to set the record straight. All of our products are made from non-toxic, pet-safe materials and are designed for the specific chewing style and size of your dog. From gentle teething puppies to extreme power chewers, Nylabone has a safe, healthy chew for every dog. Nylabone stands for the highest quality in chews and treats. It is our goal to exceed consumer expectations for our products in innovation, safety, quality, and the enjoyment of the people and pets we serve.

Summary of the eRumor: There’s a photo of a wolf pack walking in a straight line with a caption that claims the first three wolves are old or sick and set the pace for the rest of the pack. "," These rumors about the behavior of wolf packs are false. They cropped up on social media and image sharing sites in December 2015.

If it was the other way round, they would be left behind, losing contact with the pack. In case of an ambush they would be sacrificed. Then come 5 strong ones, the front line. In the center are the rest of the pack members, then the 5 strongest following. Last is alone, the alpha. He controls everything from the rear. In that position he can see everything, decide the direction. He sees all of the pack. The pack moves according to the elders pace and help each other, watch each other.” Cesare Brai’s photo. That makes for a compelling and inspirational story about teamwork — but it’s not true. David Attenborough took the photo in question for the BBC’s “Frozen Planet” Series in 2011. It shows 25 timber wolves hunting bison in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada. The female alpha wolf led the pack, and the others followed in a single file line to save energy as they made their way through deep snow, according to the environmental website Benvironment . Wolf packs are typically about half the size of the pack pictured in the photo from 2011. Most packs don’t hunt prey the size of bison (which is 10 times the size of a wolf), but the larger pack is able to. And the wolves walking in a single file line through deep snow is a classic example of how they’re able to use weather conditions to their advantage while hunting prey that’s much larger than them. Also, the idea that wolves have to be on the lookout for “ambushes” or attacks isn’t true, either. Wolves are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. Aside from turf battles with other wolves (which wouldn’t start in an ambush) bears are the only threat to wolves in Canada. Even so, experts say that bears are only able to prey on wolf pups because grown wolves are too fast, swift and clever to get caught by them.","Animals"

The most common type of rat in NYC is the Norway rat, also known as the brown rat. These rats typically grow to seven to nine inches in length and weigh less then a pound. As of 2004, the largest brown rat on record weighed about 2.5 pounds. Other breeds of rats can weigh up to 4.5 pounds, but they typically aren’t found in the U.S. The alleged 41-lb. rat shown in the viral picture fits the description of an African giant pouched rat or a Gambien pouched rat. They can grow to be up to three feet long but weigh nowhere close to 41 lbs. A description of the two species of rats on Animal Diversity Web indicates that the giant rat in photo is probably an African giant pouched rat because it has “soft, grey coats and white fur on the belly.” Pouched rats are not native to NYC, but they’re commonly kept as pets and sometimes are released into the wild. There have been scattered reports of Gambien pouched rats being caught in NYC over the years. Back in 2012, a gigantic Gambien pouched rat was found in a footlocker in the Bronx: It’s true that gigantic rats have been caught in NYC, but the “41-lb. rat” from the picture does not weight 41 lbs and it was not captured in NYC.

"Photo of Asian Beetles Embedded in a Dog’s Mouth-Truth!","2015-11-20 09:42:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/photo-of-asian-beetles-embedded-in-a-dogs-mouth/"," A photo shows Asian beetles embedded in a dog’s mouth and warns of the potential dangers of dogs eating Japanese beetles. "," This warning about Japanese beetles embedded in a dog’s mouth is true. Asian beetles (which look a lot like ladybugs) have been known to embed themselves in roof of dogs’ mouths and cause serious health problems. The medical jargon for the Asian beetles embedded in a dog’s mouth is “acute corrosion of the oral mucosa in a dog,” according to a paper published by the National Institutes of Health . The author wrote that multi-colored Asian beetles that had been ingested by a dog became ingested in its mouth and caused chemical burns: A six-year old mixed-breed dog presented with severe trauma to the oral mucosa suggestive of chemical burn. Sixteen Harmonia axyridis (Coccinellidae) were removed from the oral cavity, which revealed trauma consistent with chemical burn. The beetles had become embedded in mucosa covering the hard palate and required manual removal. A diagnosis of beetle induced chemical burn was warranted and consistent with the nature of the chemical constituents of H. axyridis hemolymph. A photo that shows Asian beetles embedded in a dog’s mouth went viral on Reddit in November 2015. The warning is very real, but it’s not clear where that photo came from. ","Animals"
"430-Pound Deer in Hartford, Michigan, Shot by Hunter- Truth! & Fiction!","2015-10-30 12:44:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/430-pound-deer-in-hartford-michigan-shot-by-hunter/"," A photo shows a monstrous 430-pound deer in Hartford, Michigan, that was shot by a hunter. "," This tale about a monster buck that was shot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula is a combination of truth and fiction. The photo of a hunter posing next to a 400-plus pound trophy buck usually resurfaces each year as deer hunting season approaches. The photo is usually accompanied by a caption that says a 430-pound in Hartford, Michigan, was “just shot”: The deer in the photo is real, but there are a few details that need to be cleared up. First, the buck was raised on a game farm called Wilderness Whitetails located in northern Wisconsin — not in the wilds of Hartford, Michigan. The owners of the game farm, Greg and Shorty Flees, use a genetic program to breed trophy bucks like the one pictured, according to the business’s website: Greg and Shorty, working purely with their own Wisconsin genetics program, began seeing the results of their meticulous and time consuming selective breeding program. Shorty and Greg’s first 200-inch buck developed on the ranch in 1989 when bucks of that size were unheard of. The Flees genetics pool today is so strong and so deep that the occurrence of 200-inch bucks on their property is as common today as 160-inch bucks were years ago. A photo of the (supposedly) 430-pound deer appears in a photo gallery of trophy bucks shot at Wilderness Whitetails in 2009. Shorty Flees told Field and Stream that a customer shot the buck in September 2009. And, contrary to rumors, it didn’t quite weigh 430 pounds. It was 420 pounds “live weight,” the largest whitetail ever shot on the game farm: “Our client hunted this deer for 11 days. We’d had very warm weather and this buck just would leave his bed in a cedar swamp during the day. But it finally cooled off, and the hunter caught the buck making its way from the swamp to a food plot. He was so pumped, he just went nuts. He was kissing the deer.” So, some of the details about the monster buck photo that circulates each year as deer hunting season approaches are true, and others are not. ","Animals"

"," There have been lots of reports of the world’s biggest anaconda being captured over the years, but don’t believe them. The biggest anaconda on record measured 28 feet long and 44 inches around. That’s not the biggest snake on record, however. That title belongs to an Asiatic Reticulated Python that grew to be 33 feet long. The website Before it’s News (falsely) reported in 2010 that a 150-foot snake had been captured after eating a man alive. The website later reported that a new record-breaking snake that measured 195 feet had been captured, which is also false. The website publishes user-generated content and isn’t a trustworthy source for news. Claims about the world’s biggest anaconda have been circulating the web ever since. Some claim that the world’s biggest snake measured 100 feet; others claim that it measured 160 feet. Either way, they’re all wrong. Most of stories about record-breaking anacondas show an areal view of a river with what appears to be a massive snake swimming against the current: But the photo has clearly been doctored. First, the “serpent” shown swimming would measure much longer than 150 feet. Given its proportion to the trees surrounding it, the serpent would be hundreds of feet long — if it were real.

"Famous Poacher Hunter Vows to Avenge Cecil the Lion’s Death-Mostly Fiction!","2015-07-29 14:38:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/famous-poacher-hunter-vows-to-avenge-cecil-the-lions-death/"," An ex-Marine turned “poacher hunter” has vowed to hunt down the poachers who killed Cecil the Lion in Africa. "," This one twists fact and fiction, but it’s mostly fiction. It’s true that poachers killed Cecil the Lion. It’s also true that there’s an ex-Marine turned poacher hunter named Kinessa Johnson. But it’s not true that she vowed to hunt down Cecil the Lion’s poachers. That rumor was started by the fake news website World News Daily Report in an effort to capitalize on public outrage over Cecil the Lion’s death at the hand of poachers. Cecil the Lion was one of the oldest and best-known lions in Zimbabwe. Researchers from Oxford tagged him in 2008 and have been tracking his movements ever since. Reuters reports that an American dentist from Minnesota named James Palmer paid a professional hunter in Zimbabwe $50,000 to hunt and kill a lion there. The professional hunter has been charged with failing to prevent the unlawful killing of Cecil the Lion. Palmer, meanwhile, said he didn’t kill Cecil the Lion and thought he had the permits required to hunt big game in Zimbabwe: Palmer said on Tuesday he had hired professional guides who secured hunting permits and deeply regretted taking the lion. He added that he had not been contacted by authorities in Zimbabwe or the United States and would assist in any inquiries. News of Cecil the Lion’s death sparked public backlash — and the fake news story that an ex-Marine poacher hunter named Kinessa Johnson had vowed to “hunt down” those responsible for Cecil the Lion’s death. According to World News Daily Report : Kinessa Johnson from Yelm, Washington State, works for the Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife (VEPAW), training park rangers to catch and detain the wildlife killers. The organization was founded by an ex-Marine and is made up of former soldiers who signed up post-9/11. “My intention is usually not to harm anyone; I don’t take pleasure in harming or killing poachers, but ultimately, it is the most efficient way to prevent poaching” she told local reporters. World News Daily Report regularly mixes fact with fiction in a “satirical” reporting style, according to its disclaimer : WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. This article is especially confusing because it blends actual events, people, organizations and quotes to create a fake news story. Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife — the group cited in the article — is a real non-profit organization, for example. And Kinessa Johnson — the ex-Marine turned “poacher hunter” who allegedly threatened to hunt down Cecil the Lion’s poachers — is real, too. But the fake news report stole a statement that Johnson made in an April 2015 profile by an NBC affiliate and applied it to Cecil the Lion’s poachers. The original quote reads: “We work side by side with park rangers and it’s truly a learning experience for not only park rangers but also our team,” said Johnson. “Our intention is not to harm anyone; we’re here to train park rangers so they can track and detain poachers and ultimately prevent poaching.” Cecil the Lion, Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife and Johnson are all real — but the World News Daily Report article isn’t.

"Sylvester Stallone Was Homeless and Sold His Dog to Make Rocky-Mostly Truth!","2015-07-23 07:33:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sylvester-stallone-was-homeless-and-sold-his-dog-to-make-rocky/"," Sylvester Stallone sold his dog as a broke aspiring actor and later bought the dog back for $15,000. "," It’s true that Sylvester Stallone sold his dog before starring in “Rocky,” but some parts of the young actor’s story have been sensationalized over the years. The rumor started with a story that first appeared on the website Endless Human Potential in 2009. The tale was later posted on Facebook , and Stallone’s rags-to-riches legend was born. The story goes that Stallone sold his dog outside a liquor store for $50 in the early 1970s because he was broke and nearly homeless. Then, once the actor managed to write and sell the script for “Rocky,” he bought the dog back for $15,000 so it could star in the upcoming movie. The basic facts of the story are true. Stallone and his wife moved from New York to Hollywood with his bullmastiff, Butkus, in the mid 1970s, Stallone said in an interview : “On our way from New York to Hollywood to seek our fortune, the heat became so intense that we had to pack old Butkus in cracked ice for two days. I promised him that if we survived, he’d someday get treated like a king. But I almost changed my mind when he practically got us killed in a wildlife preserve. An exceptionally large ostrich decided to peck him to death and attacked the car. Rather than being diplomatic, Butkus jumped out in a counter attack and I practically got slaughtered trying to separate them. By the time I got him back in the old car for a quick escape, the thing stalled and a herd of unhappy buffalo descended and attempted to upset the car with us in it. In the middle of all that confusion, Butkus jumped in the back seat and went to sleep.” Then, six months before Stallone hit it big with “Rocky,” he sold his dog to a family to help make ends meet. Stallone eventually talked the family into giving Butkus back so that he could star in the movie, the actor explains: “The other family had owned him for six months,” Stallone says.  “They weren’t exactly thrilled, but I said, ‘Please.’ I said, ‘This dog belongs in the movie.’ He had suffered along with me for two years. I said, ‘Please let him have a shot in the movie.’” Mercifully, the family relented and Stallone’s dog starred in two “Rocky” films. He even appears in the credits as Butkus Stallone. So, it’s true that Stallone sold his dog before his big break. But Stallone didn’t sell his dog to an unknown man outside a liquor store, and there’s no proof that he paid 15,000 to get Butkus back, as the eRumor claims. It’s not uncommon for the line between truth and fiction to blur for dramatic effect in the retelling of rags-to-riches stories like this one. Another example is the legend of Stallone writing and selling “Rocky,” which is also repeated in this eRumor. It’s been widely reported that a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner inspired Stallone to write the original script for “Rocky” in less than a day. Much of that is true, but again, parts of it have been fictionalized. In a 1976 interview with a New York Times reporter, Stallone said it took him 10 months to write the script after watching the Ali-Wepner fight: ”I was watching the fight in a movie theater,” he said, ”and I said to myself, ‘Let’s talk about stifled ambition and broken dreams and people who sit on the curb looking at their dreams go down the drain.’ I thought about it for a month. That’s what I call my inspiration stage. Then I let it incubate for 10 months, the incubation stage. Then came the verification stage, when I wrote it in 3 1/2 days. I’d get up at 6 A.M. and write it by hand, with a Bic pen on lined notebook sheets of paper. Then my wife, Sasha, would type it. She kept saying, ‘You’ve gotta do it, you’ve gotta do it. Push it, Sly, go for broke.”’ So, the key points of this eRumor are true. But details have been added to Stallone’s “rags-to-riches story” over the years for dramatic effect. ","Animals"

"," Hot asphalt burns dog paws, but that’s not what the grizzly photos on social media sites show. The photos show the red, blistered paws of a dog that was left on a scalding rooftop in Pennsylvania back in 2011. Bernie, a two or three year old pit bull, suffered third degree burns on his feet, but he later made a full recovery : Bernie was placed under general anesthesia for the procedure, prior to which his feet were wrapped, and he was given antibiotics. The day after the injections, Wagner anesthetized Bernie again to check the progress. His pads were more irritated after the treatment, but Wagner says that is to be expected considering how many injections were done. Bernie’s pads were rewrapped, and the dog’s pain was appropriately managed, Wagner says. Bernie, who is estimated to be 2 or 3 years old, is now back with the rescue league, which is trying to find him a new home, but Wagner checks his progress every Monday . As of Sept. 6 , Wagner says his feet are 95 percent healed. Dogs can burn their paws on hot asphalt, but the injuries won’t be as severe as Bernie’s unless a dog was forced to stand on the asphalt for a long time. Milder burns can actually be hard to spot, especially if a dog’s pads are black. Many people don’t notice that their dog’s paws are burned unless they are constantly licking them or limp when they walk. Veterinarians say that it’s best to avoid walking dogs on hot surfaces, and to be especially careful around lakes. Water softens dog pads and hot surfaces like boat docks and pavement can easily burn them. ","Animals"

"," The National Park Service has issued a report on the incident that says there was no fishing going on at all in the area of the attack…not by Jessie’s uncle or anyone else.  The report says Jessie was attacked while swimming and that the uncle did manage to drag the shark ashore by grabbing its tail.  According to an editorial in the Pensacola News Journal (7/27/01), the rumors about the uncle fishing for shark started a couple of days after the attack on Jessie and spun out of control from there, especially on the Internet.  There is no ranger who shot the shark and no witnesses at all who saw anybody fishing.  The National Park Service would like to figure out where the rumor started.

"," This eRumor is false, but various versions of it have been circling the Web since 2008. Earlier versions of the eRumor claimed that the fallen soldier’s name was Peter Mallory, and that Mallory was posthumously awarded the Silver Medal for his courageous service. Those claims were likely removed from the latest versions of the eRumor because they can easily be proven false. A Washington Post database of all the soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan does not include anyone named Mallory. The name “Mallory” also does not appear in a database operated by the website HomeofHeroes.com that lists every recipient of the Silver Star in the wars on terror. Also, one of the photos used in the eRumor, which reportedly depicts Tank lying next to a kennel in a dog shelter, was taken from an animal group’s website . The photo shows a black lab that suffered a broken spine and had to be put to sleep. The facts of the eRumor also do not make sense. Organizations like Dogs on Deployment and Guardian Angels for Soldier’s Pet help deployed veterans find temporary or forever homes for their dogs and pets. It seems unlikely that a solider would make an outside arrangement with an animal shelter because those organizations specialize in placing pets in loving, caring homes. But although the story about Tank the black lab is false, the story’s larger point about veterans’ willingness to sacrifice for the greater good is accurate.

It is very rare to see an orca hunt in this fashion unless you happen to be in South America. These mammals have been observed beaching themselves to catch their prey on the Peninsula Valdes, Patagonia, Argentina.  One orca will quickly swim to the beach and land two-thirds of its massive close to six ton body on the sand at the same time catching a tasty and nutritious elephant seal or sea lion in its mouth.  It will carefully maneuver itself back into the water without killing its prey in order to share it with the rest of the pod.  This behavior was first discovered in 1975 and the Orca Project was founded to observe and study the behavior of these killer whales in their natural state.   The hunting method is not without risk, however, as hundreds of killer whales have been know to die each year during their quest for food from dehydration due to exposure if they trap themselves on the beach. updated 02/05/13 ","Animals"
"Environmental fears over Navy sonar-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/navysonar/"," There are several emails circulating about this, but the most popular one says it’s endorsed by musician James Taylor, actor Pierce Bronson, and adventurer/oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau.  It says that they are disturbed that the Navy is going to start bombarding the oceans of the world with noise in the form of “Low-Frequency Active” sound waves (LFA).  The sonar, which is due to be used in 80 per cent of the world’s oceans, is to detect and track enemy submarines.  The signers of the email are especially concerned about the sonar’s effect on whales and dolphins, which depend on their sensitive hearing for survival.  The email says that if any ocean life swims too close to the devices that originate the sound waves, the powerful emissions could destroy hearing, cause lungs or ears to hemorrhage, and cause death.  They cite an episode in The Bahamas in which whales from four different species mysteriously beached themselves.  It was discovered that most of the whales had hemorrhaging around the inner ear and a U.S. Navy report concluded that the beachings were probably the result of use of mid-frequency sonar.  The email says that funding for the program is being decided right now in congress and gives you a website to use to register your opinion. "," This is a real issue and the eRumor about James Taylor, Pierce Bronsan, and Jean-Michel Cousteau joining together about the controversy is true.  They teamed with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Ocean Futures Society (OFS) in April, 2001 when hearings were held by the National Marine Fisheries Service on whether the Navy would be allowed to deploy the system. Critics of the sonar say a significant event occurred in the Spring of 1991 that underscored their concerns.  The Navy was using a sonar system in exercises in the Bahamas and, according to the  New York Times (April 15, 2001), 16 beaked whales and a dolphin became disoriented and stranded on beaches and in shallow water around the northern islands.  Most of the whales were guided back to the open sea, but six of them and the dolphin died.  Necropsies showed the mammals had hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears.  A year later, a task force that included the Navy concluded that it was “…highly likely…” that the strandings were linked to the sonar.  The Navy has responded by saying that they were using a medium-frequency sonar in the Bahamas and the one they want permits to use is a low-frequency sonar and that they propose standards for its use that would protect and monitor marine life. Still, according to the U.S. Navy, whales being killed or injured by sonar is largely unproven. Lt. William Marks, the Navy’s spokesman on sonar and marine mammal policy, told TruthOrFiction.com that the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration lists more than 35,000 incidents of stranded mammals over a period of ten years. Only one of those has been conclusively linked to the use of Navy sonar–and that’s the one in the Bahamas in 1991.  Lt. Marks said that since that event, the Navy has been careful to not to operate under the conditions that existed in the Bahamas.

The Ithica Journal’s Dave Henderson says there is another deer mystery in Delaware County, New York.  A hunter is said to have found a 70-pound button buck wedged in a tree about 12-feet off the ground.  A wildlife technician said the deer had been shot with an arrow but he had no idea how it got into the tree.

Wichita resident Bill Driver was standing on the deck of his house near Sandalwood Lake when he saw an 8-inch child’s basketball floating on the surface. But the ball wasn’t floating normally so he went to investigate and discovered that the ball was stuck in the mouth of a large flathead catfish. He called to his wife to get the camera then grabbed a sail from his 9-foot sailboat to use to try to coax the catfish closer to his private dock.  Driver says the fish tried to dive several times but was clearly exhausted from having such a buoyant object in his mouth.  He tried several times to get the ball out and finally succeeded by piercing it with a knife.

"," There is controversy over rBST, which stands for recombinant bovine somatotropin.  It is an artificial growth hormone used in cows. We’ve not found the family of Marissa, the 11-year old girl referenced in the eRumor.  If she is real her family’s suspicions are worthy of consideration but do not constitute proof that what they describe has been caused by ingesting milk from Wal-Mart.  There are other conditions that can cause early menstruation such as hypothyroidism.  Also, although there are fears, there is not scientific agreement about whether rBST is harmful to humans. RBST is a synthetic version of bST or BGH, a natural growth hormone in cows which, among other things, affects the amount of milk produced by a dairy cow.  Use of bST to increase milk production has been around since the 1930’s then along then the synthetic version came into popularity. Critics of the use of rBST say that it is banned for use in cattle in virtually every major country in the world except the United States.  They point out that there is an increase in health problems in cattle that produce the most milk so the use of rBST should be avoided on that ground. Supporters say rBST helps dairy farmers with better milk yield and that there has not been any proof that the hormone causes problems in humans.  It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although this eRumor focused on Wal-Mart milk there are several different milk companies that use cattle treated with rBST and Wal-Mart also sells milk from cows that are not injected with it.  Because of the controversy over rBST a lot of the milk products without it are labeled as such and are not hard to find. In March, 2008, Wal-Mart announced that rBST will no longer be found in milk from either Wal-Mart or Sams Club. Updated 3/25/08 ","Animals"

"," Pronged dog collars are a training tool that are suggested by professional dog trainers for dog owners who may have dogs that are harder to train. In order to work, they must be properly fitted so that the least amount of effort is used by the dog owner to train the dog to walk properly. This according to a spokesperson at the K9 Connection, who said that the collars are actually one of the safest collars to use because they do not put stress on the dog’s trachea and larynx. The injured dog in the photo may have been a result of improper use of a prong collar, or it may not have been properly fitted. Prong collars should only be used when training the dog and one that is too loose or too tight will lose its safety features. These collars should never be used on a dog for an extended period, for example, tying the dog in the back yard.

"," The pictures are authentic, although collected from various sources, but the story that accompanies them is a fabrication.  There is no real story of an Australian fisherman whose act of kindness developed a friendship with a great white shark.  The article referenced in the eRumor as being from “Le Magazine des Voyages de P êche ” was an April fools joke from 2006. Let’s start at the beginning. First, the two pictures of the kayak being followed by a great white shark are real.  They were taken off the coast of South Africa by award-winning photographer Thomas P. Peschak. Peschak explains on his website at www.thomaspeschak.com that the pictures are the result of research as to why great white sharks were congregating in shallow water off some of South Africa’s swimming beaches.  In order to observe the sharks up close the scientists tried using kayaks.  The sharks’ curiosity brought them close, but without apparent threat to the researchers.  The picture of the shark following the kayak has circulated widely on the Internet along with speculation that it was Photoshopped or faked.  Peschak said he snapped the photo while hanging off the tower of one of the research vessels and it was later published in Africa Geographic. The photographs of a man apparently touching a great white shark are from Michael Scholl, founder of the White Shark Trust ( www.whitesharktrust.org ) in South Africa.  The trust offers opportunities for field research for those interested in great white sharks.  That includes first-hand encounters with sharks that are lured to the research boats.  Some of the sharks are known to curiously hang around and allow themselves to be touched.

"," There is no dispute that the exhibit by Costa Rican artist Guillermo Vargas (real name Guillermo Vargas Jiménez) took place in Managua, Nicaragua in 2007.  He also goes by the artist name of “Habacuc.” There is also no dispute that the reports about the exhibition have sparked international outrage.  Websites, blogs, and petitions were devoted to protesting the exhibit and calling for the artist to be uninvited from the Central American Biennial event in 2008. There is not agreement, however, about whether the dog was mistreated and died as a result of Vargas exhibit. Vargas said that the display at the Codice Gallery in August, 2007, was intended to give tribute to a man named Natividad Canada, a 24-year-old Nicaraguan who died in a Costa Rican factory after being attacked by two Rottweiler dogs in 2005.  The exhibit also reportedly included the words “You Are What You Read” written with dog food, a recording of the Sandinista National Anthem playing backwards, and a censer in which burned “175 rocks of crack cocaine and an ounce of marijuana.”. Vargas said he got the dog, which he named “Natividad,” from the streets of Nicaragua. Circulated emails, blogs, petitions, and websites say the dog was already starved from living on the streets then was denied food and water during the exhibition and died as a result. An article from Costa Rica’s La Nacion newspaper in October, 2007, said the dog died after the first day and that the death was confirmed by Marta Leonor Gonzalez, editor of the cultural supplement of La Prensa in Nicaragua. A news release from the gallery, however, told a different story.  Jaunita Bermudez, the director of the gallery, said the dog was at the exhibit for three days beginning Wednesday, August 15, 2007.  She said that he was allowed to run free in an inner patio except for three hours per day when the dog was on exhibit.  She also said that the dog was given water and food that was brought by the artist himself.  Bermudez said that the dog escaped through the main gate of the facility during the early morning hours of Friday, August 17, while a night watchman was cleaning the sidewalk outside. Lilian Schnog, president of the Humanitarian Association for the Protection of animals in Costa Rica also looked into the incident and told TruthOrFiction.com that the dog did not die at the exhibition, but escaped as reported.

"," The Office of Protected Resources, an US government agency responsible for protecting marine mammals and endangered marine life, have confirmed that long finned pilot whales are being hunted.  According to their website the pilot whale continues to be hunted and slaughtered on the Faroe Island which lies between Denmark and Iceland in the cold Atlantic waters but there is no danger of this species becoming extinct. The Office of Protected Resources falls under the Fisheries Department of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce. Long finned pilot whales are part of the dolphin family and like all marine mammals they are a protected species in the United States but classified by the NOAA agency as a “Low Risk Least Concern.”  In the North Atlantic there are about about 750,000 long fin pilot whale in number.  Male pilot whales can measure up to 25 feet in length and weigh up to 5000 pounds.   The female of the species is generally smaller in length measuring about 19 feet and weighing in just short of 3000 pounds.   This is an anti-tropical (cooler water) species with a usual habitat of deep open ocean but they have been been spotted in coastal regions depending on season. According to the Office of Protected Resources site, pilot whales are very social creatures and travel in large groups of up to 200 called pods.  Whalers benefited from this by driving and herding them together into tight groups.   The whales follow their food source in the waters consisting mostly of whiting fish, squid, and mackerel. According to a 9/14/2003 BBC News story, residents of the Faroe have been hunting for pilot whales for centuries, giving them valuable food stocks for the winter.   The island has had a Norse settlement since the Viking age (800-900 AD.) The shore-based hunters in the Faroe Islands of Denmark continue this practice and it is a community effort for storing whale meat and products for the winter. Pilot whale meat and blubber is considered by islanders to be an important part of their staple diet.  The whale meat is never sold, instead it is divided evenly to everyone who wants it.  What ever is left over is donated to the local hospital and senior citizens on the island.  There is very little of the whale that is actually wasted.  The islanders use the blubber for processing oil, the skin for ropes and lines, stomachs for floats, and the esophagus for shoes.  Pilot whales register high in mercury so pregnant mothers are warned against partaking in the meat. As for a ceremony of rite of passage, other than the traditional confirmation or getting married we found no evidence of a required whale hunt for the young men on this island. The communal processing is open to anyone on the island who regardless of age or gender.

"Dog Owner experianced problems with ProMeris Flea and Tick Treatment-Depends on How It is Used!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/promeris/"," The originator of the email, a woman named Kathryn L. Leinthall, says that she had “debilitating” results using ProMeris flea and tick treatment on her 7 dogs and that she was affected by the product as well.  Her message says that within less than 2 hours of receiving the treatment, 4 of her dogs had vomited, were disoriented, were stumbling, and had other symptoms.  The dog owner says that in addition, she also began having symptoms such as swollen lips, red eyes, and disorientation.  All 7 of her dogs, she says, were admitted to a veterinary hospital and she was taken to a hospital emergency room. "," Kathryn Leinthall is real and lives in Interlaken, New York. Her    experience with ProMeris is also real. ProMeris is a product that its maker, Fort Dodge, describes as flea and    tick treatment that “effectively stops and controls existing flea    infestations for up to seven weeks in cats and six weeks in dogs.” It is sold only through veterinarians, not over-the-counter. Fort Dodge said that although there seem to be several different events of    adverse reactions being reported on the Internet, their investigation into    the matter concluded that all of the reports stem from a single case. The company acknowledges that on Friday, April 11, it received a report    from a veterinarian involving six Siberian Huskies and one mixed-breed dog    that experienced reactions to ProMeris. According to Fort Dodge the    clinical signs reported are similar to what they have seen in their safety    studies when there was deliberate oral exposure to ProMeris.  But the    product is designed to be absorbed through the skin, not through    ingestion. Fort Dodge said that the most common adverse effect reported since    ProMeris was introduced to the market was lethargy, which can happen if    the dog orally ingests ProMeris. The company reminded pet owners    that ProMeris is designed to be applied in just one location on the dog:    onto the skin between the shoulder blades.  It should not be applied    on the surface of the dog’s coat or other    locations on the dog’s body.  Putting ProMeris between the shoulder    blades prevents the dog from licking it.  Putting it elsewhere,    especially on the surface of the dog’s hair, increases the risk of the dog    ingesting it orally and possibly experiencing the symptoms described.

There is also a species of Humpback dolphin called the Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphin found mostly in Southeast Asia.  Some of them have pink-colored skin because of blood vessels used for keeping the body temperature cool during exertion.  One of them became a celebrity in Thailand and also a focus of controversy.  The dolphin got caught in fishing nets during the summer of 2007 and ended up in a resort on the island of Samui in Southern Thailand.  When reports surfaced that the dolphin was being trained to entertain tourists an outcry rose among animal rights activists.  The government says the dolphin is scheduled to be rehabilitated and released back into the the gulf of Thailand by early 2008.

"Dogs Were Used for Shark Bait by Fishermen on African Island-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dogs-sharkbait/"," A forwarded email warning that dogs are used as shark bait by fishermen on the island of Réunion that lies off the coast of Africa.  It includes a plea to sign a petition to stop this cruel act. "," According to a National Geographic article published October 19, 2005, there were at least three cases discovered of dogs being used for shark bait on the island of Réunion.   The island is under French control and lies off the east coast of the African Continent. Click for article The article said that Reha Hutin, the president of Paris based Foundation 30 Millions d’Amis (the Thirty Million Friends Foundation) sent a film crew to the small volcanic island to document claims that live animals were being used by fishermen to catch sharks. They discovered that stray dogs and cats on the island are viewed as vermin and the foundation plans to finance a sterilization program to reduce the population of strays. This still video photograph was in the National Geographic article taken by Thirty Million Friends Foundation. This dog managed to escape fishermen before it could be used as live bait and was lucky enough to be found and taken for medical attention. He is shown here as a veterinarian prepares to remove the hook from it’s snout.   The operation was a success and the dog is now at home with its owners. Fabienne Jouve  is a spokesperson for the French animal rights organization, Groupement de Réflexion et d’Action pour l’Animal (GRAAL). He noted that, “Lately, almost every week, one dog has been found with hooks on the island, not counting the cats found on the beaches partially eaten by the sharks.” This barbaric act isn’t just as simple as running a hook through the stray animals and tossing them over the side of their boats.  In order for the fishermen to entice the carnivorous predators off their coast they hook the dogs snouts and paws and let them bleed out for at least a day. The article said that several animal rights activist groups have known about the inhumane practice of using live dogs for shark bait and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation has been fighting this for a decade.  Patti Davis, daughter of President Ronald Reagam wrote a web-exclusive commentary in Newsweek about this in October of 2005. The Friday Harbor, Washington based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has offered “a U.S. $1,000 reward to any Réunion police officer who arrests anyone using live dogs or cats as bait for sharks.” In September of 2005, the government of Réunion responded to the outcries by passing into law a bill that would make it illegal for fishing boats to carry any dogs or cats, alive or dead. Shortly after the law was enacted the article said “the first court case was held involving a person charged with using live dogs as bait. Authorities had found a seven-month-old puppy on John Claude Clain’s property in July with three fishing hooks in its paws and snout.”  This resulted in a 5000 euro fine  for Clain. The article also said that “Both the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the United Kingdom and the Thirty Million Friends Foundation are asking animal lovers to sign a petition urging the French government to step up enforcement of laws against the use of live dogs as bait.” Click here for petition. updated 02/16/09 ","Animals"

"," Crabzilla is a hoax. This image posted by Bing Maps shows the shores off the seaside town of Whitstable in southeast England. The Bing Maps satellite image is exactly the same as the image used in the eRumor, only the real version is missing the 50-foot Crabzilla. The gigantic crab was clearly added to the satellite image by a prankster. The doctored Crabzilla photo was first posted at WeirdWhitstable.com , a website that covers unusual or paranormal activity in the seaside town. Quinton Winter, the website’s administrator, first told the Express that he had personally witnessed Crabzilla and that an anonymous user submitted the photos to him.

"," If you think this one smells fishy, find it hard to swallow or perhaps think this is a whopper of a fish story your are correct. According to the “Shanghaiist” web site , the origin of this email is very most likely from China and in the Chinese language.  The site went on to say that the government of Huadu had issued a statement disclaiming this saying, “no sighting of any large man-eating fish has been reported, and that no deaths have occurred in the reservoir between 25 July of last year and now.” The specimen in the photo is not a catfish.  It is, in fact, what marine biologists have labeled a rhincodon typuse.  This is the largest fish in the sea, what we commonly know today as a whale shark. Whale sharks normally range in length from 18 to 32 feet and can weigh just over 20 tons.  They are found in the warm water habitats of all tropical seas.  Although they are classified as carnivorous they really are filter feeders and nowhere close to being a “man eater”.  Filter feeding is a process of gathering food by scooping up plankton, small crustaceans and small fish along the surface with their colossal gaping mouths and filtering their meals by forcing the water out of their gills. In his “Undersea Discoveries of Jacques-Yves Cousteau Series”, the late undersea marine wildlife expert called them “peaceful giants” and wrote that they have been know to grow between 40 and 50 in length. updated 02/06/09 ","Animals"
"Cocoa Mulch Contains an Ingredient Harmful to Pets-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cocoa-mulch/"," There are several versions of this eRumor but all of them say that commonly sold cocoa mulch contains theobromine which can be lethal to cats and dogs.  One version tells the story of a pet owner who lost a dog because of cocoa mulch. "," It’s fairly well known that some animals should not eat chocolate and according to the experts we checked with that warning applies to cocoa mulch as well, although the number of reported animal deaths is very low.  The villain is theobromine, a chemical that is similar to caffeine.  It can give a boost to humans but dogs and cats cannot always metabolize it successfully and it can be lethal to them.  That is especially true of the shells of the cacao beans, which are ground up and used in cocoa mulch, and contain even higher levels of theobromine than the bean. Most packaging of cocoa mulch makes it clear that it’s not for human or animal consumption.  It also appears that all cocoa mulch is not the same.  One manufacturer we checked with, the maker of Mirana cocoa mulch, said that their mulch is the result of a series of processing steps and that the level of theobromine in their mulch is barely detectable. We did find at least one documented case reported in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)..  The report says that a dog that had ingested cocoa mulch developed convulsions and died 17-hours later.  An analysis of the stomach showed ingested cacao bean shells and lethal levels of theobromine. The AVMA has issued a release because of this new eRumor about cocoa mulch.  It says that according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), there have not been any reports in 2006 of animals dying from cocoa mulch ingestion.  In the years spanning 2004 and 2005 there were 16 cases of cocoa mulch ingestion reported, none of which resulted in death. The ASPCA says that the account of the death of the dog named Calypso that is in the eRumor is “suspect.”  The symptoms are not completely consistent with death from cocoa bean ingestion.  The ASPCA says that although vomiting is a common result, the dog is described as having had a single seizure the next day during a walk and then dying suddenly, which is not what would be expected.

"," The story and the video are real, although some of the facts are wrong. The release and reunion of Christian the Lion took place in Kenya more than 30-years ago.  The eRumor with the video link about Christian began circulating in July, 2008. Australian John Rendall and his friend Ace Berg bought the lion cub from Harrods in London in 1969 when the world famous store had an exotic animals department. Herrods had gotten the cub from Illfracombe zoo and it was on display at the store in cage when spotted by Rendall and Berg. Christian lived in the basement of Rendall’s flat in Chelsea and for a year was a pampered cat.  And a clean one too, according to Rendall.  He unfailingly used a very large kitty litter box and was jointly cared for by Rendall, Berg, and two of their female friends. Christian eventually grew to nearly 200 pounds and started growing a mane, which made him look fearsome even though he was very friendly and accompanied his owners to all kinds of events.  He became a feature at Rendall’s furniture store and one day Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna walked into the store and saw Christian.  They were actors who had been in the film Born Free, the true story of a lion cub named Elsa that was successfully rehabilitated into the wild in Africa by conservationist George Adamson and his wife Joy. It was decided that Adamson and Africa might be the next destination for Christian.  Adamson was cautious because Elsa had been an African lion born in Africa.  Christian was from London and had lived a very different first year of life. In Arica, Christian befriended a lion from the Born Free film named Boy.  Adamson added a female lion to the friendships and began the process of educating Christian about the wild. Rendell and Berg would visit from time to time to check on Christian’s progress but it was in 1974 that Adamson told them that Christian had finally adapted to the wild.  He had a litter of cubs, did not return to the camp very often and was the leader of his pride (Boy had been shot and killed in a tragic event near the camp.) Upon hearing the news, Rendell and Berg decided they would make a final trip to say goodbye even though Adamson told them it might be a waste of time.  Christian had not been seen in nine months.  But when the two men arrived in Kenya Adamson told them that Christian and his pride of lionesses and cubs had arrived the night before, almost as though he had known they were coming.  Adamson said Christian was sitting on his favorite rock outside the camp waiting for them.  The reunion, as seen on the video, was one of overwhelming joy and tears.  Afterwards Adamson warned that the lionesses didn’t seem too pleased with what was going on so it might be time to leave.  It was the last time that Christian was ever seen. Adamson continued his work in Kenya but was shot and killed in 1989 by either poachers or bandits. A film and a book were made about the remarkable story of Christian the Lion.

The Pali Momi medical center is probably a reference to the Kapiolani Medical Center at Pali Momi, which is on Oahu, not Maui, so it isn’t likely the victim was “rushed” to a different island for his emergency to be handled. Additionally, there is not documentation that anyone has died from contamination on a soft drink can and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has no record of the story described. It’s possible that the story about the stock clerk arises from genuine concern over what is called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. According to the Centers for Disease Control, this condition can happen in a human and is usually from the person breathing fresh droppings of deer mice (plus cotton rats and rice rats in the southeastern states and the white-footed mouse in the Northeast). An outbreak of this condition occurred in 1993 in the Four Corners area of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah from which some otherwise healthy young people died. The CDC emphasizes that it is not spread by ordinary house mice or common rats. The condition mentioned in the second eRumor, leptospirosis., is different from the hanta virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control, leptospirosis is normally the result of human exposure to water contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Updated 6/8/05 ","Animals"

A later version says the photo is of a forest service worker and also includes a picture of an alleged bear attack victim and says the bear had been responsible for several human deaths in Alaska and was the largest bear ever recorded.  Some of the eRumors include pictures of mangled human remains alleged to have been one of the bear’s victims.

The facts are a little different from the original eRumor, but the pictures do record the results of a true hunt and are real.

"The whale that thanked its rescuers-Reported to be Truth!","2015-03-17 17:57:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/grateful-whale/"," The story of a humpback whale that was wrapped in crab traps and lines near San Francisco, California.  After working long and hard to cut the lines from her, she is said to have rejoiced and returned to “thank” each of the rescuers. "," According to the San Francisco Chronicle article from December 14, 2005, this story is true although animal experts say nobody knows what was happening in the mind of the whale when these incidents took place. The whale was spotted by crab fishermen wrapped in the nylon ropes that connect crab traps to each other.  The traps are heavy and the whale was struggling to keep on the surface so it could breathe. Experts assessed the situation and concluded that the only chance the whale had is if rescuers would actually get into the water with her and cut her bonds one-by-one.  That was risky because any thrashing on the part of the 50-ton animal could be deadly.  One of the divers, James Moskito, said the whale was peaceful during the hour or so it took him and others to cut the ropes and there was a vibration coming from the whale the whole time.  Moskito said that when the whale realized it was free it began swimming in circles.  “”It felt to me like it was thanking us, knowing that it was free and that we had helped it,” Moskito said.,  “It stopped about a foot away from me, pushed me around a little bit and had some fun.”  He said the whale nuzzled him, then swam to each of the other rescuers as well.

"Modern day Jonah swallowed by a whale-Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/newjonah/"," An English commercial fisherman in the early part of the 20th Century is  thrown from his whaling ship and presumed lost at sea.  Later, he is discovered alive inside a whale that is harpooned by the whaling ship.  He is taken back to England where after receiving medical treatment he lives out his life, although his skin is blemished by the gastric juices of the whale. "," The story dates back to the late 19th century and involves a whaling ship named the ‘Star of the East’, operating off the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. According to most accounts, a whale was sighted, the harpoon boats were launched, and the whale was successfully speared. In the violence that followed, however, one of the smaller boats capsized, throwing two crew members into the sea. One of them drowned and the other, said to be a man named James Bartley, disappeared. The whale was eventually subdued and its carcass hoisted onto the ship where the crew started carving it up for blubber. After a couple of days of work, they got down to the stomach, where some workers noticed something large inside, ‘doubled up’, and showing signs of life. They cut the stomach open and there lay James Bartley, unconscious and somewhat digested, but alive. They doused him with sea water, put him in the captain’s cabin and after a couple of weeks of recovery, he was back on the job. Most accounts of the story also include a detailed description of what Bartley experienced and felt during his whale of a journey. He is quoted as saying that he remembered flying through the air when the whale struck the boat with its tail – and then suddenly being in darkness and slipping along a smooth passage of some sort. He then came into a larger area marked by a slimy substance that seemed to shrink from his touch. He finally realized that he was in the whale. He said that he could breathe, but that it was very hot in there. At some point he lost consciousness and the next thing he remembered was being cared for by the crew. Some versions of the story say his skin was permanently affected by the gastric juices in the whale, and that he had a bleached white appearance for the remainder of his life. Other versions describe his skin as having been left with a bluish color. There have been a few other, similar stories, but researchers suspect that they all have the same origin. The story of James Bartley is therefore of greatest interest, since there are so many accounts of it and they include enough information to allow some good digging to be done. The definitive research into this story has been done by Edward B. Davis, a professor at Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. He was curious to try to document the story since it was so often repeated in Christian literature and had even found its way into several Bible commentaries. His research is summarized in an article in ‘The American Scientific Affiliation’, published in 1991. Davis not only scoured newspaper files, original documents and libraries, but spent time in England tracking down some of the sources. He verified, for example, that there really had been a vessel named the ‘Star of the East’ and that its captain was a man named J.B. Killam. He followed the trail of the great British engineer, Sir Francis Fox, who was so struck with the Bartley story that he included a chapter on it in his autobiography, published in 1924. The result of Davis’s research was that he could not find any credible evidence to support the James Bartley story. In fact, he found evidence which made the story seem more questionable. He checked out a report that Bartley had been treated at a London hospital for the effects of the whale’s gastric juices on his skin, but could not find any substantiation for it. When he read through the documents about the particular voyage during which the alleged whale incident happened, James Bartley was not listed as a crew member. More damaging to the story was a letter written by the wife of the captain of the ‘Star of the East,’ Mrs John Killam. The contents of her letter were published in 1907 in ‘The Expository Times’ by a reader who had corresponded with Mrs Killam about the whale story. She said, “There is not one word of truth to the whale story.  I was with my husband all the years he was in the Star of the East.  There was never a man lost overboard while my husband was with her.  The sailor has told a great sea yarn.” The story has been widely repeated by a number of conservative Christian writers, including Bernard Ramm, Harry Rimmer and the creationist Henry Morris; and also in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary on Jonah and the IVP Bible Dictionary. One of the alleged sources of the James Bartley story was a newspaper report published in Great Yarmouth, on the east coast of England. Davis visited the port and found an article that gave an account of the story, but it offered nothing to help support the facts of it. He also found a whale story dated 1891 – the same year as most of the James Bartley accounts. According to the story, a 30-foot rorqual whale caused a stir when it came close to the shore off the town of Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth. It ran against the town’s pier and beached itself while being chased by several boats. The whale became a local celebrity and was known as ‘the Gorleston Whale’. The carcass was hoisted, became an exhibit for a couple of days, and then a taxidermist stuffed it and it was displayed in the London Westminster Aquarium. According to Davis, two of the clippings he found about the Gorleston Whale, including one written within days of the event, reported that the story had ‘inspired a number of exaggerated tales.’ Has there ever been another human being besides Jonah who has survived being swallowed by a sea creature? We can’t say, and it is not our purpose to challenge the scriptural story.. Stories such as the one about James Bartley, however, have not measured up to a standard of reliable evidence. Thanks to Edward B. Davis for agreeing to this use of his research material, and for checking the accuracy of this report.

"," A wonderful story, especially when tied to a wonderful Bible verse, but both The National Geographic Society and officials at Yellowstone Park say it never happened.  TruthOrFiction.com has searched an index for National Geographic, but did not find the story.  Additionally, a representative of the National Geographic Society, L.T.

Summary of eRumor There are several versions   of this eRumor.  Some simply say to not buy ultra bleach   because it has poisons in it.  Others have been targeting pet   owners saying that the new Ultra Clorox product is both sodium   hypochlorite AND sodium hydroxide, which is lye.  The eRumor   says the lye has been added to make the bleach work faster but is   difficult to rinse off surfaces so can be toxic to animals.  It   recommends against using the product in areas where animals   live.  It also claims that Ultra Clorox has been “cruelty   tested” with animals.  Some versions go on to recommend   the brands that they feel you should use instead of Ultra Clorox. "," There is no truth to this and the cynical would say that the originators of these emails have not so much been opposed to Ultra Clorox as they have been loyal to whatever products they recommend be used instead. According to the folks at Clorox, the “Ultra Clorox” product is the same bleach, the same formula that Clorox has used for years.  The only difference is that it’s more concentrated so less is needed per load of laundry.  When diluted, it’s virtually the same as the original Clorox bleach. Even ordinary chlorine needs to be used with caution and the labels on the products need to be read and any warnings heeded. Does Ultra Clorox contain sodium hydroxide (lye)?  According to Clorox, yes…and so does every other bleach on the market.  It is generally less than 1 percent of the volume.  Contrary to the claim in the eRumor, sodium hydroxide is not “added” to the chlorine to make it work faster.  It is a natural byproduct of the process of making chlorine, according to Clorox.

"," This mailer is from officer Stephanie Mohr who is in prison and appealing a conviction that resulted from an incident with her police dog on 9/21/95. According to court records, an officer was doing surveillance in an area of Prince George’s County where burglaries had been taking place. When he spotted two men on top of a building, he radioed for help and someone, in turn, asked for a K-9 (dog) unit.  Officers Stephanie Mohr and Anthony Delozier, along with a Maryland State Police helicopter, all showed up at the scene. The two suspects were arrested and charged with burglary.  The charges were later dismissed against one of them.  The other pleaded guilty. In 2000, the suspect whose charges had been dismissed brought action against Mohr and her partner with violating the law by “acting under color of law to willfully deprive him of his right to be free from the use of unreasonable force.”  Both were also charged with conspiracy.  In the trial Officer Mohr said that one of the suspects did not raise his hands as ordered and did not follow her orders to stop when he came down from the roof.  She says that his body motions indicated to her that he was beginning to flee in a direction where there were no officers.  She says she told him to stop then released the dog to handle it.  The result was that the suspect was bitten by the dog.  Prosecution witnesses said they remembered it differently.  The officer who originally requested the assistance, Sgt. Dennis Bonn, among others, testified that the two suspects came from the roof peacefully, with their hands in the air, and did as they were told.  He says the dog was released on the suspects as they stood cooperatively with their hands up. The jury dropped the conspiracy charge against Mohr and the violation of rights charge against her partner but could not agree on the violation of rights charge against Mohr or the conspiracy charge against her partner.  A mistrial was declared.  The second trial convicted Mohr of the violation of rights charge and cleared her partner of the conspiracy charge.  She was sentenced to 120 months in prison. Officer Mohr says she’s been the target of zealous prosecutors who are looking for cases of civil rights violations against minorities and that some testimony against her has been stacked against her.  Critics of Mohr say she was part of a pattern of officers whose dogs had bitten cooperative suspects.

"Poinsettia plants are poison to children and pets-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/poinsettias/"," It’s common around Christmas time for people to warn one another about the alleged toxicity of poinsettias. "," This is one of those beliefs that is so widespread that a survey of       florists found that most of them believed it to be true. That’s       because it has been the conventional understanding about poinsettias       for many years. The consensus of government agencies, health centers, veterinary       groups, and plant and       flower organizations that we’ve surveyed, however, is that poinsettias are not       toxic and do not pose a health threat to children or pets. The belief in poinsettia poison appears to extend back to 1919 when       the two-year-old child of a U.S. Army officer died.  It was       believed that the death was caused by the child ingesting poinsettia       leaves.  The American Society of Florists has looked into the       matter extensively and says there was never any proof that       poinsettia leaves were responsible for the child’s death and the       report was later determined to be hearsay. The America Society of Florists joined with researchers at Ohio       State University to test various parts of the poinsettia plant on       rats.  Their conclusion was that there was no toxicity or any       other side effects even when the rats were given large       doses. POISENDEX is the source of poison information for the majority of poison       control centers.  It says that a 50-pound child would have to       eat more than a pound-and-a-quarter of poinsettia leaves to exceed       the doses used in the Ohio State research, which would be 500 to 600       leaves. The American Society of Florists says no other consumer plant has       been tested for toxicity more than the poinsettia. The ASPCA Animal Poison Center in Urbana, Illinois says it regards       poinsettias as having such low toxicity risk that it doesn’t even       recommend decontaminating animals that may have ingested them.        The center says that there can sometimes be gastrointestinal       distress from having ingested something alien to the digestive       system. The American Veterinary       Medicine Association of America (AVMA), doesn’t include poinsettias       on its list of plants that are a threat to animals. Because of the belief that poinsettias are toxic, there are numerous       visits to hospitals each year by concerned parents or pet owners whose children       or pet have ingested or in some other way been exposed to       poinsettias. A study released in 2000 by Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and       Carnegie Mellon University found that out of nearly 23,000       poinsettia exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide,       there was essentially no toxicity of significance of any kind.

"," Nobody has revealed  where the elaborate Chalk River story originated, but the picture of the alleged 87 pound cat is a hoax.  TruthOrFiction.com has been in contact with Cordell Hauglie, who is the person who created the picture using Adobe Photoshop.  He says it’s actually a picture of his pet cat named Jumper and that he created it as something amusing to send to his daughter. That was a couple of years ago. At first, the picture alone started circulating on the Internet.   Somewhere along the way, it picked up the “Snowball” tale, but Hauglie has no idea where.  Ever since the eRumor started circulating on the Internet, the folks in the Chalk River area have been getting questions about the cat, but, of course, none of the locals has ever had first-hand knowledge of it.   The AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited) facility says no one by the name of Rodger Degagne ever worked there and that their labs are still operating, not merely remnants from the 50’s.  There is a gentleman in the area with a similar name, Roger DeGagne, but he says he knows nothing of the Snowball story. There are problems with the picture that made many people (including TruthOrFiction.com) believe it was a fake.  We, and others, thought the cat did not look like it was being held, but Hauglie says 20-pound Jumper was being held in the original picture by his son Jason.  It’s actually Jason’s hand that is seen under the cat and, knowing that, it’s obvious that the hand was enlarged with the rest of the picture of the cat and looks out of proportion.  Hauglie says one of the theories floating around about the picture is that he is a midget holding a normal-sized cat in a small house, which is not the case.  Another problem was that if the man in the picture were really holding a cat that weighs nearly 90 pounds, he would not be doing it with such little apparent effort.

"," Cow tipping is the kind of topic that comes up when there isn’t much else to talk about.   When it does, there is frequently dispute between those who believe cow tipping is real and has happened, and those who say it’s nonsense.
