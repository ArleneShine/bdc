"Strange Sea Creatures Washed Up From the Tsunami-Fiction!","2015-03-20 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamifish/"," A collection of pictures of very weird looking sea animals said to have been washed ashore by the South Asian tsunami in December, 2004. They are all new species of fish. "," The pictures are authentic but have nothing to do with the tsunami. They are some of the specimens collected by a joint Australian-New Zealand research team studying the Tasman Sea, which is located between the two countries. It was called the Norfanz Voyage and studied deep sea habitats in the Tasman sea. Many new species were discovered. Click here for the Norfanz web page. Last updated 3/22/05","Tsunamis"
"Pictures of the Tsunami-Fiction!","2015-03-20 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamipic2/"," A series of pictures showing bystanders being hit by huge waves. They are being circulated as “pictures of the tsunami by someone who was there.” "," These are not pictures from India, Sri Lanka, or anywhere else affected by the disastrous tsunami of December 26, 2004. The photos are actually said to have been taken by an amateur photographer named Youling Popo and are of an annual phenomenon on the Qiantang River in Jiuxi of Hangzhou, East China’s Zhejiang Province. The high tide, typically in September, brings high waves crashing against the sea wall. These pictures are not from a tsunami but of smiling locals and tourists with umbrellas enjoying the expected crashing waves. Last updated 1/4/05","Tsunamis"
"Picture of Tsunami in South Asia-Fiction!","2015-03-19 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamipic/"," Not much text with this eRumor. Just a picture alleged to be of the tsunami wave that devastated South Asia. "," This picture is a hoax. Thanks to tips from several of our readers we have confirmed that this shoreline is actually that of Antofagasta, Chile in South America. The wave depicted is as tall as some of the multi-story buildings on the shore.  The South Asia tsunami was devastating, but was not characterized by waves that were hundreds of feet high.  The destruction was primarily from the fact that the waves represented oceans of water that were following them onto shore and creating water levels that were many feet higher than normal.

"Help Identify a Young Girl Left Alone by the Tsunami-Truth!, butResolved!","2015-03-17 22:02:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamisurvivor/"," Picture of a young girl said to be a lonely survivor of the 2004 Tsunami in Thailand. "," According to UNICEF’s       child trafficking arm The Innocenti Research Centre, this girl was a       victim of the South Asian tsunami, but has been identified. She is Sophie Marleen Micl. She became separated from her parents in Phuket, Thailand on the day       of the tsunami waves and when she was found, she was taken to a       hospital in Phuket.. She was not identified until several days later. Her parents have never been found. She was returned to Germany for further medical treatment and is in       the care of relatives.

"Help the Victims of the Tsunami","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tsunamirelief/"," Various emails asking for support for victims of the tsunami waves in South Asia. "," The devastating tsunamis in South       Asia have prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support from       people around the world who want to help those who have been       affected by them. TruthOrFiction.com has had a lot of experience with humanitarian       relief efforts and we have some recommendations that will help       ensure that the support you give will go to the people who need it. 1.  If you get an email requesting donations for tsunami       victims, don’t respond directly to the email or any links in the       email, even if it seems to be from a trusted organization. The reason is that you may get an email from crooks who merely       want to capture your personal information including your credit       card. The safest thing to do is to go directly to the website of the       organization or call them by phone. If you don’t know the web address, use Google or some other search       engine to find it. 2.  Donate only to trusted organizations who have a       reputation for doing the kind of work that you believe in and,       preferably, already work in the areas affected by the tsunamis. This is a biggie. A disaster of this proportion inspires us all to want to help. One of the difficulties, however, is that well-meaning people and       organizations start grass-roots efforts that either don’t help or,       in some cases, inadvertently end up being a hindrance. That’s why it’s best in the long-run to simply donate to       organizations that are already there, that do this on a regular       basis, that have personnel at the scene, that have the best channels       for receiving and distributing the aid, and that know exactly what       the needs are. Even as I write this, there are campaigns in various cities to       collect food, clothing, diapers, blankets, and other supplies, but       the chances for those goods actually getting to the people who need       them are poor. It is heartbreaking to be on the scene of a disaster and know that       there are airplanes that cannot land because nobody was expecting       them, goods being stockpiled at an airport or a dock because there       is no arrangement for being able to distribute them, and tons of       supplies that are either not helpful to the relief effort or, if       they are, will have to be sorted and there is not enough personnel       or time to do that. Another sad reality of disaster relief efforts is that not all       government officials in all countries are honest and unless supplies       are coming into the area through trusted sources, there is the       danger for much of it to end up in the hands of unscrupulous people       or end up on the black market. One of the truths about human suffering is that many of the areas of       the world  where there is the greatest need are areas where       there is the least concern on the part of the government for the       people being served. In some countries, the danger is not from the government, but from       insurgents and competing political groups that may have control over       a particular portion of the nation. The bottom line is that we all need to help but we also need to make       sure that our help will get to the people who need it.","Tsunamis"
"400 Christians saved from tsunami death in Indonesia?-Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/meulaboh/"," The email says that 80% of the town of Meulaboh in Ache, Indonesia, was destroyed by the tsunami in December, 2005. But the lives of 400 Christians were saved because they had been prohibited from celebrating Christmas in the Moslem city and were on a hill outside the city for Christmas when the waves came. "," Getting to the bottom of this story       has been difficult, probably because the person who is alleged to       have originated it, Bill Hekman, is ministering in an area that was       hard-hit by the tsunami and where communication has been affected. We have not found any independent substantiation of this story apart       from the originators of the eRumor. If there was a large group of Christians who escaped the tsunami       because of having hiked up a hill to celebrate Christmas, there has       not been any other word of it. That doesn’t mean it didn’t happen but in a disaster of this       magnitude and where everyone from the media to the military were       delighted to find stories of survival and courage, it would be a       significant story. Bill Hekman is the pastor of Calvary Life Fellowship in Indonesia. According to the church’s website, he has been reached by telephone       in Meulaboh and has confirmed the story. The website says that the church has also substantiated the story       through an Indonesian pastor and “…several persons with       firsthand knowledge.” There may be some truth to the story, but we’re classing it as       “unproven” until we can further information and from       additional sources.

"," This email was published on the       Internet after the boy was found alone in Thailand. It turns out that he is 2-year old Hannes Bergstroem from Sweden.
