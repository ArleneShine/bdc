"University of Wisconsin Demands Students Wear Hijabs-Mostly Fiction!","2016-12-08 13:44:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/university-wisconsin-demands-students-wear-hijabs/"," The University of Wisconsin-Madison forced female students to wear traditional Muslim hijabs during Islam Appreciation Week in Wisconsin, signaling the beginning of Sharia Law. "," Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison volunteered to wear hijabs to help understand what it’s like to be a Muslim woman in American society — but nobody was forced to partake. Rumors that the University of Wisconsin demanded that students wear hijabs spread across fringe websites after the student newspaper, the Badger-Herald, ran a story about the “Hijabi for a Day” event in early December 2016. That rumor is wrong on two fronts. First, the “Hijabi for a Day” event was organized by a Wisconsin chapter of the Muslim Students Association for Islam Appreciation Week. Second, students weren’t forced to participate in it — the elected to do so voluntarily. The student group’s website describes the Hijabi for a Day event as such: An exciting opportunity for those who are interested in trying on a Hijab for the day. Come pick your Hijab up at 8:15 am at the Red Gym. Feel free to keep the Hijab on as long as you feel comfortable. Around 7 PM a reflection on the experience will take place in the MSC Lounge, so please come join us for this discussion! The student newspaper, the Badger-Herald , interviewed organizers and participants of the Hijabi for a Day event : Farhat Bhuiyan, one of the organizers of the event, said one of the main goals is to normalize Muslim female practices. She said hijabs don’t always mean that a person is Muslim, they often do. Throughout the day, Bhuiyan said she received both positive and negative feedback. She said that the negative feedback suggested it was cultural appropriation or offensive. Bhuiyan said those who feel negatively might not understand the point of the event. She responded to every message she received during the day, trying to explain the organization’s goals. At the end of the day, the women had an opportunity to reflect on the experiences and describe their feelings when wearing hijabs. In the end, claims that the University of Wisconsin, or anyone else, demanded that students wear hijabs for Islam Appreciation week are false. Some students did, however, volunteer to do so for the student-organized event. ","Religious"
"School Handing Out Donuts with Muslim Writing-Fiction!","2016-12-06 08:43:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/school-muslim-donuts/"," A viral photo shows a donut with “Muslamic writing” that was apparently handed out by a school to children. "," Muslim writing does not appear on this donut — the script is actually Orkish, the language created by “Lord of the Rings” author J.R.R. Tolkien. It’s not clear exactly where the image originated, but it was shared thousands of times after being posted at the Lord of the Rings-themed Facebook page Modor First: Hundreds of people who commented on Modor First’s post recognized that the image was posted as a joke, and that there’s no such thing as “Muslamic writing,” the punch line was quickly lost on others as the image made its way around social media. But the text that appears around the edged of the donut isn’t Arabic or “Muslamic” writing — it’s the same text that appears on the outside of the all-important “One Ring” from J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy: Translated from Tolkien’s invented Orkish language , the text on the outside of the ring (and donut) reads, “One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” The original Lord of the Rings Donut appears to be a work of fan art made by artist Mirach Ravai: There are many examples of the “One Ring” donut posted from around the world, too. This photo of a so-called donut with Muslim writing is actually a donut emblazoned with the Orkish language from Lord of the Rings. ","Religious"
"Muslims Attack Christmas Tree in Mall-Fiction!","2016-12-05 14:04:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslims-attack-christmas-tree/"," A viral video shows offended Muslims attacking a Christmas tree at a mall in Sweden. "," This video doesn’t show Muslims attacking a Christmas tree in Sweden — it shows Christians in Egypt engaging in an annual “tree plundering” celebration. The rumor started in mid-November 2016 when a video of a tree plundering celebration was misidentified as offended Muslims attacking a mall Christmas tree in a “western nation” on fringe and fake news websites: Ahh, the religion of peace and tolerance. Whenever Muslims move to Western nations they try to change everything about the culture to conform to sharia law. When they’re not doing that, they’re tearing down Christmas trees, because, Jesus, birth of the Son of God and all that. To them, Jesus is only a prophet, to Christians, He is God’s only son born of a woman. The video was quickly aggregated by other fringe websites that have been linked to fake news reports, and the mislabeled video of the mall Christmas tree was viewed hundreds of thousands of times by people who believed it actually showed “offended Muslims” attacking a mall Christmas tree in Sweden or a “western nation.” In reality, the video was originally posted by in January 2016 and it shows the inside of the Mall of Arabia Cairo in Egypt engaging in a local Christian tradition called “ tree plundering ” that dates back to the 1800s. Also known as looting the Christmas tree, the ceremony is traditionally held on January 13th each year, and it marks the end of the Christmas season. Ornaments are stripped from the tree, and edible decorates like candy and fruits are eaten — which appears to be what the video in question shows. The video clearly shows women and children taking ornaments from the tree while people wearing Santa hats and whistling look on. The video clearly doesn’t show angry Muslim men attacking the Christmas tree out of anger, as has been claimed. ","Religious"
"Pope Benedict XVI: Catholics Cannot Vote for Hillary Clinton-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-10-21 12:49:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pope-benedict-xvi-catholics-cannot-vote-hillary-clinton/"," Pope Benedict XVI supposedly wrote in a “blistering” letter in 2004 that Catholics cannot in good conscience vote for pro-abortion candidates like Hillary Clinton. "," It’s true that Pope Benedict XVI wrote about Catholics supporting pro-choice causes in  2004, but the church’s position isn’t that Catholics can’t morally support pro-choice candidates like Hillary Clinton. rumor appears to have started with Tell Me Now , a website that publishes a combination of factual, fictional and opinion-based articles with an anti-liberal slant, with a story appearing under the headline , “Pope Benedict XVI Forbids Catholics from Voting for Hillary!” The story cites a 2004 letter written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , who became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, titled “Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion.” The letter addresses whether those who support issues like abortion and euthanasia can receive Holy Communion. The letter doesn’t name Hillary Clinton or any other candidate by name, and Tell Me Now selectively edited the letter to make it appear that Pope Benedict XVI was specifically talking about Cahtolics supporting political candidates: The Church teaches that abortion or euthanasia is a grave sin. The Encyclical Letter Evangelium vitae, with reference to judicial decisions or civil laws that authorize or promote abortion or euthanasia, states that there is a “grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection. […] In the case of an intrinsically unjust law, such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia, it is therefore never licit to obey it, or to ‘take part in a propaganda campaign in favour of such a law or vote for it’” (no. 73). Christians have a “grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which, even if permitted by civil legislation, are contrary to God’s law. Indeed, from the moral standpoint, it is never licit to cooperate formally in evil. […] This cooperation can never be justified either by invoking respect for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact that civil law permits it or requires it” (no. 74). Pope Benedict XVI advised priests in the letter to meet with parishioners who support or vote in favor of laws permitting abortion or euthanasia and to instruct them about the church’s stance on these issue. The letter says priests should warn parishioners that they may be denied the Eucharist for continuing their support: Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, when a person’s formal cooperation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his Pastor should meet with him, instructing him about the Church’s teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist. Cardinal Mario Popedda, the retired head of the Apostolic Signature (known as the Vatican’s supreme court), said in 2005 that it would be “formal cooperation in evil” to vote for a candidate solely because of  their support of abortion or euthanasia — but that’s rarely, if ever, the case because decisions are far more nuanced than that, Fr. Charles Irvin wrote : “I would be cautious in applying the word ‘sin,’ which implies intentionality. It would be more accurate to speak of risk or imprudence,” he said. “Of course, whoever votes for a ‘pro-abortion’ candidate assumes a responsibility, but it does not necessarily involve sin as an immediate consequence,” he said. The cardinal said a Catholic voter might choose such a pro-abortion candidate as a “lesser evil, when there are no candidates who respond more fully to his scale of values. He might choose him, let’s say, for other aspects of his (political) program that the voter supports.” Catholics who do vote for such a politician might carry out their own pro-life responsibilities in other ways, for example, by working against abortion through political or cultural initiatives, he said. “I think that rarely or never is there a candidate who presents himself solely on the basis of his support for abortion. And I think it’s very unlikely that a voter would vote for him solely for this reason,” he said. For his part, Pope Francis declined to endorse either Clinton or Trump in the election. Rather, he advised Catholic voters to “study the issues, pray and then vote your conscience,” the Associated Press reports : Francis was asked Sunday en route home from Azerbaijan how he would counsel the American faithful who are being asked to choose between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Francis said he would never interfere in an election campaign, saying “the people are sovereign.” “I’ll just say this: Study the proposals well, pray, and choose in conscience.” So, while the Catholic church’s views on support for pro-choice candidates appears to be open for discussion, claims that church leaders have said Catholics cannot morally support pro-life candidates solely for that reason are false.

"," Bill Perkins of Compass International wrote this commentary about Donald Trump meeting with 1,000 Christian leaders in June. The story appeared at a website maintained by Compass International , a non-denominational evangelical non-profit group that focuses on outreach and mission work, under the headline, “Trump Meets with Evangelical Christian Leaders” and begins: This was a fascinating day in New York City as over 1000 Christian leaders from all over the U.S. gathered to ask Donald Trump tough specific questions about his policy and intentions should he be elected POTUS. The event organizers originally requested Dallas, Texas as a middle-of-the-nation location to hold a private, get some private time with Trump event, hoping to attract some 200-300 national Christian leaders. But the only opening on Trump’s schedule was in NYC for 20 minutes, 30 days out. So they took it. A screening committee, scouring the Internet, sent out invitations to about 1000 Christian leaders. Because the high expense of flying into and staying in NYC, and the date less than 30 days away, they reserved a room for only 100 people at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. Each person who accepted the invitation then had to be vetted, and ultimately ok’ed by the Secret Service. Once cleared, you were notified by phone. I got two sets of phone questions about my work with Compass and when finally approved, had 10 days to make plans. (I’m sure I was at the end of the list!!) But despite receiving the late notices, the response to attend was off-the-charts. Almost everyone who they invited accepted the invitation. And some who were left off the original list apparently lobbied for inclusion. Ultimately there were over 1000 who hastily changed their schedules to attend. Perkins goes on to write that Christian heavyweights like James Dobson, Ralph Reed, David Jeremiah, Tony Perkins and Robert Jeffress attended and questioned Trump about a range of national issues: Through it all, Trump answered each of our questions with solid answers, both acknowledging the problem cited and how he would take care of the problem. He seemed to be genuinely concerned about changing the direction of the nation. Trump addressed many subjects including the Supreme Court, national defense, border problems, Christian persecution, his pro-life stance, support of Israel, dumping Obamacare, education control back to the states and energy. All with conservative positions and answers. The event that Perkins appears to be describing was called “A Conversation with Donald Trump.” Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee moderated the event, and Ben Carson participated as well.

"," Rumors that Colin Kaepernick has converted to Islam can’t be confirmed at this time. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback made waves in August 2016 when he refused to stand for the singing of the National Anthem in an effort to spark debate about racial inequality and needed criminal justice reforms, Kaepernick explained in a statement : “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Kaepernick’s statement sparked plenty of debate about patriotism, the national anthem and athletes’ role in social issues. The debate also drudged up unproven rumors from July 2016 that Kaepernick had converted to Islam, and that his protest was in some way connected to his new faith. Those rumors started after Kapernick posted a message from his official Istagram account wishing Muslims who had been fasting during Ramadan a “Happy Eid”: Kaepernick didn’t indicate that he himself had been fasting for Ramadan in the post, or that he had converted to Islam, but the post immediately sparked rumors that he had. Infotainment websites like Media Takeout (MTO) News and the Terez Owens sports gossip blog reported that Kaepernick had converted to Islam, due in large part to his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. These stories both credited unnamed “people close to the player” for their scoop, and it’s impossible to confirm of debunk unnamed sources. It should be noted, however, that MTO News has an ambiguous disclaimer that states its stories are presented “as is” with no claim of truth or accuracy. And the Terez Owens story included photos in which Kaepernick’s head had been photoshopped onto the bodies of Osama bin Laden and an ISIS terrorist. Nevertheless, these blog sites were cited as evidence that Kaepernick had converted to Islam by fringe websites like the Conservative Daily Post and the Conservative Tree House and Info Wars . We couldn’t find any credible information about what religion, if any, that Kaepernick practices. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Religious"

"," Reports of baptismal water slide at Elevation Church are works of satire. The story first appeared at The Babylon Bee on August 2nd under the headline, “Elevation Church Debuts Water Slide Baptismal,” that reports : Pastor Steven Furtick took the stage under a single spotlight, and after some coy banter, he reportedly announced that it was “Baptism Sunday,” but that this was “not your Mama’s Baptism Sunday.” At this cue, a giant water slide, stretching from the balcony down to a small pool of water, was unveiled from behind a large curtain as the worship band began performing TLC’s 1994 hit “Waterfalls.” Those, like Marie Dotwiler, who had been ushered to the new entrance were directed one-by-one into the orange contraption and, with a push, sent hurtling toward the waters of baptism in screaming identification with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The story, which appeared under the headline, “Jesus Not Coming Back By the Looks of it, Admits Vatican,” has been shared on social media more than 225,000 times. The story begins: A SPOKESPERSON for the Vatican has officially announced today that the second coming of Jesus, the only son of the God, may not happen now after all, but urged followers to still continue with their faith, regardless of the news. Cardinal Giorgio Salvadore told WWN that this years 1,981st anniversary is to be the Vatican’s last in regards to waiting for the Lord to return to Earth. “We just feel Jesus is not coming back by the looks of it.” he said. “It’s been ages like. He’s probably flat out doing other really good things for people somewhere else.” Waterford Whispers News clearly identifies itself as “a satirical newspaper and comedy website” — not a credible source of news. However, a similar story resurfaced in July 2016 when the website Real Time News re-reported the story under the headline, “’Jesus Is Not Coming Back, He Was Drunk When He Said So’ – Roman Catholic Leaders Say.” Real Time News doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake news or entertainment website, but the story is still a fake one. Reverend Joseph Osei-Bonsu, the president of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, has even directly addressed claims that Christian believers should no longer expect Jesus to return to Earth: The Most Rev Osei-Bonsu, who is also the Bishop of the Konongo-Mampong Diocese, said no one knew the time of Christ’s return, as was written in Mark 13:32, “But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” He explained that ‘that day’ clearly referred to the Parousia, the return of Christ at the end of time, and stated that if neither the Son (Jesus) nor the angels knew the time of the second coming, how would any Cardinal, or any person for that matter, know? On claims in the publication that Jesus was drunk at the time He made the prediction, the Most Rev Osei-Bonsu said there was no evidence in the Bible, or anywhere else, that Christ was “drunk” when he made that statement. “The publication is just malicious and blasphemous and I would urge all Catholics and, indeed, all Christians, to ignore it and treat it with the contempt that it deserves,” he said.

The fake interview, which appeared at the video game news site Play4Real under the headline “ Pokémon Creator Admits Games are Anti-Christian, Aimed Towards Satanists,” includes excerpts from a fictional Time magazine interview : Time: What inspired you to start making the Pokémon games? Tajiri: Well, my parents were Christians. I grew up being taught the ways of that religion. When I got older, I started to realize that the things they said were foolish and I guess I rebelled a little. Time: How did you rebel? Tajiri: I started to argue against their teachings. They tried to punish me in various ways to try to get me under control, but it didn’t work. This is when I was inspired by nature and started the basis for the Pokémon games. Time: Could you explain how your parent’s religion is connected with the games? Tajiri: Well, when I got old enough, I wanted to do something that would show the world that my parents were wrong. Something I saw in nature was the concept of evolution which my parents vehemently denied existed. This sparked the idea for a game that would go against everything my parents believed in. Time: This game being Pokémon, correct? Tajiri: Yes. Pokémon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is made especially explicit in the Pokédex entries. Nature, again, played a big role. Time: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct? Tajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don’t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it. In reality, that interview never took place and Pokémon’s c reator never said the game was anti-Christian or was geared toward Satanists. He did, however, sit down for a real interview with Time Asia in 1999 and talked briefly about the game’s inspiration, which was Tajiri’s fascination with collecting bugs: TIME: Did you get the idea for Pokémon from these insects? Tajiri: Yes. Places to catch insects are rare because of urbanization. Kids play inside their homes now, and a lot had forgotten about catching insects. So had I. When I was making games, something clicked and I decided to make a game with that concept. Everything I did as a kid is kind of rolled into one–that’s what Pokémon is. Playing video games, watching TV, Ultraman with his capsule monsters–they all became ingredients for the game. Tajiri rarely gives media interviews, and we couldn’t find any evidence of him talking about Christianity or Satanism. ","Religious"

"," Accounts of two Muslim students objecting to the Swiss handshake tradition for religious reasons are true In Switzerland, it’s tradition for schoolteacher to shake students’ hands before and after class in a show of respect. After two Muslim students refused to shake a female teacher’s hand because their religion forbids contact with non-family member females, a school district in Basel County granted the boys an exemption that allowed them to refuse shaking all teachers’ hands, not just females ones, in April, Swiss Info reports : On Monday, school officials spoke out for the first time, defending their decision. School rector Jürg Lauener said a compromise had been reached with the students involved, in that they also do not shake the hands of male teachers. “They are no longer allowed to shake the hand of any teacher, male or female. For us, that addresses the question of discrimination,” Lauener told Swiss public television, SRF That touched off a debate with the Swiss teachers’ union arguing that “the same rules should apply to all students” and that it was the wrong signal to send since the boys would need to shake hands with peers and colleagues of both sexes in the future lives. In May, a regional school board overturned the local school board’s decision to exempt the boys from handshakes and concluded that school districts could fine students about $6,500 if they refused to comply, the National Post reports : Under the decision, teachers at the school can require their students to shake hands. Refusal to comply could land the parents with a warning, a call to a meeting with school leaders, other disciplinary measures, and in the extreme, fines of up to 5,000 francs as part of standard school policies, the board said. Sanctions would need to have “an educational purpose and be proportionate,” it said.

Here’s a screen grab of one of them: However, confusion over whose head was depicted stem from the fact that artistic renderings of Imam Hussain and Jesus are very similar. Both men are portrayed has having a full beard, long hair and fair skin. Here’s a rendering of Imam Hussain: And the reason Imam Hassain’s decapitated head in the rally marks the retellings of his death, having been decapitated after rebelling against Yazid leaders in Syria in the 7th century, according to the book “Islamic Unity and Happiness.” Each year, Shiite Muslims around the world commemorate Imam Hassain’s death in February — and that’s what the marchers shown in the 2009 video from Dearborn were doing. That’s why we’re calling claims that radical Muslims were marching in the streets of Dearborn with paintings of Jesus’ decapitated head fiction. ","Religious"
"Denny’s Waitress Assaulted by Muslim Men for Serving Bacon-Fiction!","2016-06-16 15:34:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dennys-waitress-assaulted-muslim-men-serving-bacon/"," A report that two Muslim men assaulted a Denny’s waitress because she served pork during Ramadan has gone viral. "," A fake news website is behind this false report of a Denny’s waitress being assaulted for serving bacon during Ramadan. The story originated at JTXH News under the headline “Denny’s Waitress Assaulted by Muslims for Serving Bacon During Ramadan” that begins: ROUND ROCK TX: A Denny’s waitress was allegedly assaulted by two Muslim men for serving pork during Ramadan. The woman, an 18 year old that had just graduated high school, was working at a local Denny’s restaurant when she was reportedly insulted by two passers-by on Wednesday. The men are said to have started to abuse her when they saw she was serving bacon to customers, The Times reported. She said one of the men screamed she was a “whore” and slapped her across the face, leaving her with a black eye after she was knocked to the ground. The story was widely shared on social media, and many believed that it was an actual news report about a waitress being assaulted for doing her job. However, JTXH News is a relatively new fake news website that was launched in April 2016. The site doesn’t clearly identify itself as fake or satirical news, which often leads to confusion. The fake Denny’s report even generated enough interest that the Statesman , a daily newspaper based in Austin , contacted local police about it: Round Rock police spokesperson Angelique Myers said there is no truth to the story. “The website is not one bit credible,” she said by email. Despite its lack of credibility, the story has been shared through social media and has garnered 61 comments on the website as of Wednesday afternoon. Most of the comments condemn the two men and contain anti-Muslim rhetoric. Alfonso Ruiz, an operating partner for the Denny’s restaurants in Round Rock and New Braunfels, said the corporate arm of the restaurant franchise made him aware of the story. “It’s unbelievable because I’m in my restaurant all the time,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d come up with a story like this.” In its short lifespan, JTXH News has (falsely) reported on a NASA announcement about “God and Religion,” and that Chic-fil-A is considering banning “anyone who can’t figure out their gender.” The story of a Denny’s waitress being assaulted by two Muslim men for serving bacon falls into the same category as those two stories: fake news.

"British Waterpark Bans Bikinis to Appease Muslims-Fiction!","2016-06-14 07:58:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/british-waterpark-bans-bikinis-appease-muslims/"," WaterWold, a waterpark located in England, has banned bikinis and now requires that park goers wear “Islamically appropriate” clothing. "," Rumors that WaterWorld has banned bikinis or now requires park goers to wear “Islamically appropriate” clothing there are false. The flap started in 2015 when WaterWorld held a special “Sisters Only” event that allowed women of all faiths to use the park wearing clothing that covered their bodies. Typically, the waterpark requires all of its guests to wear bathing suits. WaterWorld announced on Facebook that there would be designated areas of the park for people to pray in during the Sisters Only event in an effort to “attract ladies of all religions/beliefs as we invite you to visit our facility and enjoy its features whilst having the option of wearing attire that our normal operating procedures prevent.” It’s important to note that bikinis were not banned during the event — and the event took place outside of the park’s normal operating hours anyway. Rather, customers were allowed to use the park wearing non-bathing suit attire during it. The park also hosts “Males Only” nights that allow men to use the park “wearing attire that is considerate to all religions present.” Reports of the waterpark that had banned bikinis or required that “Islamically appropriate” clothes be worn there went viral after the park released its special events schedule in 2015. Then, shortly after the deadly terrorist shooting that left 50 dead at Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, the story was re-reported as “breaking” news by This is England under the headline, “British Waterpark Bans Bikinis and Demands Visitors Wear “Islamically Appropriate” Clothes.’” The story begins : WaterWorld in Stoke-on-Trent plans to black out windows and provide a prayer room during a women-only night aimed at Muslims. Only female lifeguards will patrol the park during the event, which has triggered a flood of complaints. Staff will also “guard” the front entrance to “make sure that no males enter the facility”. In a statement on its Facebook page, a spokesman for WaterWorld said the Sisters Only event would “attract ladies of all religions/beliefs as we invite you to visit our facility and enjoy its features whilst having the option of wearing attire that our normal operating procedures prevent”. Conservative MP Philip Hollobone said: “I imagine there would be a lot of outrage if the boot was on the other foot and swimmers were told they had to dress appropriately in respect of Christians. I don’t see how this is different.” So, given that the waterpark didn’t ban bikinis and didn’t require women to wear “Islamically appropriate” clothing, we’re calling this one fiction.

The fake report appeared at the website Newslo , a hybrid fake news website that allows readers to “show facts” or “hide facts” in its stories. The website (falsely) reported that Pat Robertson said: Pat Robertson, conservative televangelist who is no stranger to anti-gay remarks, was among the first to comment on the incident. Spotted at the scene of the event, Robertson made several interviews to reporters who were covering the story. Among other things, The 700 Club host told reporters he flew in via private jet from his home in Virginia immediately after hearing about what he referred to as “a justified terrorist attack.” Several eyewitnesses claim Robertson was wearing slippers and a bathrobe while being interviewed, as well as that “he was difficult to recognize without makeup.” One eyewitness even stated, “If it wasn’t for the name on his golden bathrobe, I would have thought I was seeing a mummy giving out statements.” “I don’t even need to tell you what all of this means,” Robertson said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. “This is how God is punishing us for the shameful SCOTUS ruling on same-sex marriage, a catastrophic piece of legislature that I have so vigorously attempted to shoot down. I kept repeating it during every single episode of The 700 Club, but nobody wanted to believe poor, old Pat. Everybody thought me for a fool. Well, I hope this is a step in the right direction. I hope people will finally start to see the light after this,” a very distressed Robertson is credited as saying. Despite the fact that Newslo clearly identifies itself as a “hybrid news/satire platform,” the fake Robertson report was picked up and re-reported as fact the U.K.’s Mirror . The story was later taken down, but its electronic digital can still be found online: So, reports that Pat Robertson said the Orlando nightclub shooting was God’s way of punishing America for the SCOTUS same-sex marriage ruling is false.

National Report published a story on May 17th under the headline, “Target to Discontinue Sale of Holy Bible.” The story reports that Target execs made the decision because of “religious extremists” who boycotted the store because of its policy to allow transgender customers and employees to use bathrooms corresponding with the gender they identify with: Minneapolis, MN – Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible.

"Email About Number of New Mosques in Florida-Fiction! & Outdated!","2016-03-28 08:28:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/email-number-new-mosques-florida/"," A viral email makes claims about the number of mosques in Florida and says 118 “new” mosques have been built in Florida in recent years. "," Information in this viral email is loosely based in fact, but its claims about the number of new mosques in Florida are mostly outdated and incorrect. Statistics about the number of mosques in Florida and other states came from a study called “ The American Mosque 2011 ” that looked into characteristics, attitudes and trends in mosques across America from 2000 to 2010. The study, which was authored by University of Kentucky professor Ihsan Bagby and cosponsored by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), counted a total of 2,106 mosques in America as of 2010 — a 74% increase from the 1,209 mosques counted in a 2000 study. Part of the reason for the growth was “greater ability to identify mosques in 2011 than in 2000 due to better websites that chart the existence of mosques.” Also, an increased number of Muslim refugees and new immigrant groups, and expansion into new parts of cities and suburbs, were cited as reasons for the growth. The study also listed the 10 states with the largest number of mosques. Florida came in fourth with 118 mosques behind New York (257), California (246) and Texas (166). So, it’s true that 118 mosques were counted in Florida in 2010 — but that didn’t mean that all 118 of those mosques were “new” then. It also indicates that the claim that 118 “new” mosques have been built in Florida that began circulating in 2016 was outdated since it clearly used information from the 2011 study. The study highlights a trend of high number of mosques being built that started in the 1980s and carried over into the new millennium. Overall, 75% of all mosques in the U.S. had been built since 1980 — 22% from 1980-89, 28% from 1990-99, and 24% from 2000-09. So, because the email claiming that 118 “new” mosques had been built in Florida that began circulating in 2016 relied on data collected in 2010, we’re calling this one outdated. We’re also calling this one fiction because the data collected in 2010 found that there were 118 mosques in Florida — but not 118 “new” mosques. ","Religious"
"Germany Bans Pork –Truth! & Fiction!","2016-03-08 08:22:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/germany-bans-pork/"," Reports that Germany has banned pork because of the religious objections of Muslim immigrants from Syria have gone viral. "," Germany has not banned pork — politicians there are actually talking about doing the opposite because a growing number of schools are deciding on their own to pull pork from lunch menus. The pork flap started in early January when a politician from German Prime Minister Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) parliamentary group spoke out about the number of schools, nurseries and public cantinas in a state in northern Germany that had removed pork from their lunch menus. CDU parliamentary group leader Daniel Günther linked decisions to remove pork from those menus to the growing number of Muslim students who had immigrated to the state. He said at least one school in every district in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein had done so, the German newspaper Lübecker Nachrichten reported in January: “The protection of minorities – including for religious reasons – must not mean that the majority is overruled in their free decision by ill-conceived consideration,” Günther said, arguing that tolerance also means “the appreciation and sufferance of other food cultures and lifestyles.” “The consumption of pork belongs to our culture,” he argued, adding that those who didn’t want to eat pork didn’t have to. “No one should be obliged to do so,” he said. “But we also don’t want the majority having to refrain from pork. German newspaper Deutsche Welle reported that CDU’s regional arm would introduce a plan that forbids public cantinas from removing pork from menus. The newspaper also noted that the plan had been widely mocked on social media by Germans. So, it’s not true that Germany has banned pork from school menus. It is true that a growing number of schools, nurseries and public cantinas have pulled pork from their menus, but nobody forced them to do so. And a plan unveiled by the CDC would actually do the opposite of banning pork in Germany — it would require public cantinas to apply for a pork exemption if it didn’t want to serve pork.

"," There are well-documented accounts of Donald Trump being a Christian dating as far back as the 1980s, so reports that Trump is an atheist are false. That rumor took flight in July 2015 in response to comments that Donald Trump made at the Family Leadership Summit. When asked by moderator Frank Luntz if he had ever asked God for forgiveness, Trump responded : “I’m not sure I have,” Trump said. “I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don’t think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.” “We I take, when we go, and church and when I drink my little wine – which is about the only wine I drink – and have my little cracker, I guess that’s a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed, OK? But, you know, to me that’s important, I do that, but in terms of officially, I could say, ‘Absolutely!’ and everybody, I don’t think in terms of that. I think in terms of, let’s go on and let’s make it right.” The unusual way that Donald Trump talked about his faith sparked public debate about how genuine Trump’s claims to practice Christianity really were at the time. A meme that went viral claimed that Donald Trump had even confessed to being an atheist in a 1989 appearance on the Phil Donahue Show: There’s no record of Trump appearing on the show in 1989, but he did make an appearance on the show in 1987. There are accounts from the time of Trump complaining about his treatment by Donahue (he accused Trump of being greedy) that make it seem unlikely Trump would appear on the show again. Trump’s roots in Christianity can be traced back to his association with minister and self-help author Norman Vincent Peale in the 1970s, the Washington Post reports : By invoking Peale, who died in 1993, Trump has something ecclesiastical he can talk about as he seeks support in the faith community, an all-important voting bloc. “The great Norman Vincent Peale was my minister for years,” Trump told CNN last July, a sentiment he repeated in Atlanta and in Iowa during stops in Ames and Dubuque. Peale, for his part, described Trump as “kindly and courteous” with “a streak of honest humility,” and touted him as “one of America’s top positive thinkers and doers.” The minister also called Trump “ingenious” and predicted that he would be “the greatest builder of our time.” Trump’s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, formally joined Peale’s Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan — a venerable affiliate of the Reformed Church in America — during the 1970s. Trump visited Marble Collegiate with his second wife, Marla Maples. (Newspaper accounts have reported that Trump’s adulterous relationship with Maples began at Marble Collegiate — “THEY MET IN CHURCH” was the New York Post headline — although Trump said in the interview that it all started at a party.) Today, Trump identifies himself as a Presbyterian. Despite rumors to the contrary, there’s no proof that he’s anything but that.","Religious"

Back in December 2015, a Facebook post told the story of a Walmart cashier in St. Cloud who was dressed in a traditional Muslim hijab and refused to check out a customer because they were wearing a cross necklace. Walmart spokesperson Kory Lundberg said in a St. Cloud Times report that the store had conducted an internal investigation and was unable to verify the claim: “We looked into the situation as soon as we learned of the allegations,” Lundberg said. “While we’ve asked our cashiers and management about this, we’ve been unable to verify that this happened at all. We’ve been working to identify the actual customer making these claims.” Lundberg said Wal-Mart officials even reviewed surveillance video of the two St. Cloud stores, but it can’t find evidence that the event occurred. Such an action by a store employee would violate company policy, he said. A short time later, the Facebook post was removed.

"," This tale about the candy cane’s origin comes from a fictional children’s book, “The Candymaker’s Gift: The Legend of the Candy Cane.” The book was published in 1996, and its fictional “legend” of the candy cane’s origin story has been mistaken for historical fact ever since. The first forwarded emails about the history of the candy cane popped up in the mid 90s, and they usually resurface each year around Christmas. The email begins : A candy maker in Indiana wanted to make a candy that would be a witness, so he made the Christmas Candy Cane. He incorporated several symbols for the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus Christ. He began with a stick of pure white hard candy. White to symbolize the Virgin Birth and the sinless nature of Jesus, and hard to symbolize the Solid Rock, the foundation of the Church, and firmness of the promises of God. From there, the email goes on to explain that the candy cane is shaped like a “J” for Jesus and that the red stripes were added to resemble the blood shed by Jesus on the cross. In reality, nobody really knows the exact origin of the candy cane, but there are a number of theories. Legend has it that the candy cane dates back to the seventeenth century. Sugar was formed into straight, hard candy sticks that were totally white back then. The theory goes that the “candy cane” came to be in 1670 when a choirmaster at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany apparently bent the candy sticks into “canes” to represent a shepherd’s staff and gave them to children during nativity services. Skeptics argue, however, that its unlikely that children would have been allowed to eat candy during a 17th century nativity service, and that there’s no actual historical record that that happened back then, according to the website Today I Found Out : It could just as well have been the case, and seems slightly more plausible, that candy canes got the crook end simply as it made them easier to hang on a tree. (This is also why they are so closely associated with Christmas today). Around the same time candy canes seem to have gotten their crook (and in the same region this seems to have first happened, Germany) many other food items started to be used to decorate Christmas trees (like cookies, fruits, candies, and other such things).  About two centuries later, the first known candy cane that popped up in America was also supposedly thanks to a German immigrant, August Imgard, who used the candy cane for this purpose — decorating a Christmas tree in his home in Wooster, Ohio. But reports that August Imgard decorated America’s first Christmas tree with candy canes has also been called into question. It’s true that Imgard introduced the Christmas tree to America, but accounts of how he decorated trees don’t include candy canes. According to a news report from 1938 , Imgard decorated his trees with cookies and nuts: People came from miles around to see the first tree and the following year there were many trees. Ornaments were made of paper, festooned in long chains by the younger members of the pioneer community. Kuchen baked according to a recipe sent from Bavaria by Imgard’s mother, hung upon the tree and served both as ornaments and tidbits. The cookies were colored with brown sugar and the family spent weeks baking them in quantities for the guests. Gilded nuts were other ornaments and inside the gilded shells were warm messages of greeting It’s not clear where the candy cane’s red stripes came from, either. Candy canes with red stripes started showing up on Christmas cards around 1900, but it’s not clear who first added them to the all white candy canes. So, to make a long origin story short, nobody knows exactly where the candy cane (or its red stripes) came from. ","Religious"
"Burger King Follows Sharia Law, Bans Bacon-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-12-18 10:39:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/burger-king-follows-sharia-law-bans-bacon/"," Reports that Burger King has pulled bacon and other non-halal products in a nod to Islamic Sharia Law has led to calls for a boycott of the burger chain. "," Burger King has operated halal restaurants in predominately Muslim areas for years, and there wasn’t any indication that the burger chain planned to dramatically change course when this rumor went viral in December 2015. It has been reported in French media, however, that Burger King plans to add about 20 halal restaurants in Europe after acquiring Quick, a Belgian burger chain. That sparked rumors that Burger King planned to go “all halal” and calls to boycott the restaurant for supporting the “Islamificiation” of the west. Those rumors started after Political Insider published an article headlined, “Burger King Just Announced THEY WILL FOLLOW ISLAMIC SHARIA LAW! – Stop Them!” The article, which was published in mid-December 2015, reports : Burger King has caved to the pressure from Islam, and they just made an announcement that they will ONLY serve 100% halal meat, under the rules of Sharia Law. The announcement comes from their chains in France, which is the same country that recently suffered from a deadly Islamic terrorist attack just one month ago. This rule also means their French stores won’t serve bacon or chicken… The Islamification of the West is spreading, and they are demanding we all live by their rules! The claim that Burger King had just announced that it will “only serve 100% halal meat” is false. In reality, Burger King has acquired the Quick burger chain (which already had 20 halal restaurants) and it planned to add about 20 more halal locations, French news site The Local reports : This means all bacon and pork-based meals will be scrapped from the menu and all the beef and chicken used will be certified halal. The move is understood to be part of Burger King’s continued attempt to take on McDonald’s – the behemoth of the French fast food world with around 1,300 stores. Quick already has around 20 halal restaurants in France, where all the meat used comes from animals slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. Despite calls to boycott Burger King after right-wing American blog sites picked up on the story, the idea that Burger King plans to operate 100% halal restaurants isn’t “breaking” news. The burger chain has operated halal restaurants in predominately Muslim areas of the world for years. There are three all-halal Burger King locations in Malaysia, for example . Also, in 2014, Burger King made waves when it brought a beef and pork free Whopper to India to cater to both Muslims and Hindus. The burger chain introduced a Chicken Whopper, a Mutton Whopper and a Vegetable Whopper there. So, in conclusion, it’s true that Burger King plans to open about 20 new halal restaurants in Europe (but it’s not clear whether or not they will all be in France). But reports that Burger King will “only serve 100% halal meat” have misled people into believing that the burger chain is making dramatic changes, and that’s not the case. ","Religious"

"," A Saudi prince has not married a 6-year-old girl. The meme, which has been circling the web since 2013, shows a picture of a man who is supposedly a Saudi prince next to a little girl in a wedding dress with a caption that reads: Saudi Prince Abou Libarae Kahtani, 51 years old, and his new bride Hind Nawaf, 6 years old, exchanged vows in Saudi Arabia last week. Reporters say it was a beautiful ceremony. In completely unrelated news, Saudi Arabia was elected the Chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council in September. The man pictured, however, is not a 51-year-old Saudi Prince. He is a Saudi cleric named Sheik Adil Kalbani, the first black man to become an imam at the Grand Mosque in Mecca . The photo was taken during an interview in which Kalbani argued against calls for universal health insurance in March 2015. There’s no record of a Saudi prince named Abou Libarae Kahtani, and the name appears to have been made up. We were also unable to track down where the photo of the little girl came from. Even though this rumor is false, childhood marriage is a real issue in Saudi Arabia. The non-profit group Equality Now reported on a 12-year-old girl who was sold into marriage to a 50-year-old man in 2010 . A judge granted the girl a divorce after Equality Now got involved with the case in 2013, but there are countless more cases like that one. In 2013, the Saudi Ministry of Justice introduced new regulations on the marriage of girls. Those regulations were to set the minimum age for marriage at 16, but it also set a number of “preconditions” that could lead to marriage before 16. Those conditions include approval from the girl and her mother, approval of a designated court and medical reports to prove the “competence of the girl for marriage,” according to Equality Now .

"Dick Smith Warns of Halal Certification Extortion-Fiction!","2015-12-02 14:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dick-smith-warns-of-halal-certification-extortion/"," Emails and social media posts claim that Dick Smith, the owner of the Dick Smith Foods franchise in Australia, warns that halal certification amounts to extortion by the Islamic Council of Australia. "," Dick Smith has not warned that halal certification is extortion. A series of forwarded emails and social media posts called “A Warning from Dick Smith” that first surfaced online in 2014. The emails and posts claimed that Dick Smith warned that the Islamic Council of Australia was extorting businesses by charging fees to use the halal logo on food labels, but that’s not true. Dick Smith Foods, an Aussie grocery chain, posted a statement on its website back in 2014 that explained its stance on halal certification. The company said it had decided not to pursue halal certification because of extra inspections and costs associated with it, not because it was extortion: We have received a number of letters from people asking if we will be putting the Muslim Halal logo on our food. To acquire Halal certification, payment is required to the endorsing body and involves a number of site inspections of both our growers and processors in order to ensure that our practices comply with the conditions of Halal certification. It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold – it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith. We are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don’t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed. Shortly after the Aussie grocery chain posted the message (which appears in its entirety above), someone added statements to make it appear that Dick Smith Foods warned that halal certification was extortion. Here are the parts that were falsely added to the original statement: We point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organisation for the right to do so. Others would add that money paid to ANY Muslim ‘organisation’ (and you had better believe it: these people ARE ‘organised’) can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary. What other assurances do we accept from Muslims? Oh, that’s right, ‘Islam is a religion of PEACE’! How less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?” This is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Aus/NZ are bullying large commercial organisations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organisations (Cadbury/ Schweppes/ Nestles/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats. Of course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury’s chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam. The Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference – but give them time. Several state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department’s current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England. After the false Dick Smith warning went viral, Dick Smith released a statement clarifying that “hoax” social media posts and emails had misrepresented the company’s views on halal certification: Please be aware that there is a hoax email being distributed on social media networks. It has been circulating for some time now and although most people are aware that it is hoax. There are others who believe it to be true and keep sharing it. Our view on Halal certification is as stated above only. Please help us put a stop to this hoax by advising anyone who shares it that it is not Dick Smith’s view on the subject. Thank you. TruthorFiction.com previously investigated rumors about Australian food companies using Halal certification .We found a claim that said anyone who buys halal certified foods supports terrorism to be false. Companies that choose to label certified halal products typically pay an annual licensing fee to use the certification logo, an ABC affiliate in Australia reports : Processed food companies, who generally pay a set yearly fee for halal certification, were more willing to talk, but few would disclose exactly what this costs. The Byron Bay Cookie Company said its annual halal certification fee was around $1,500 a year. This represented about 0.003 per cent of its total cost of doing business, a spokesman told Fact Check. Geoff Hutchinson, a director of the Fleurieu Milk Company, which forfeited a $50,000 contract to supply yoghurt to Emirates airlines after a sustained anti-halal social media campaign, says halal certification for the contract cost about $1,000, or two per cent of the contract. A spokeswoman for Nestle said the fees the company paid were negligible in the context of its total business. “They do not influence the price at which we sell our products. We don’t pass this cost on,” she said. The point of Dick Smith’s initial message about halal certification was that the company couldn’t pursue it without passing large costs along to its consumers. So, the company’s decision not to pursue certification was not a stand against the so-called “extortion” of halal certification, as the rumor claims. ","Religious"
"USPS Plans to Stop Selling Religious Christmas Stamps- Fiction!","2015-11-18 09:50:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/usps-plans-to-stop-selling-religious-christmas-stamps/"," Rumors that the U.S. Postal Service will stop selling religious stamps, including Christmas stamps, after 2015 have lit up social media. "," 2015 is not the last year that you will be able to buy Christmas and other religious stamps at the post office. That rumor started in September 2015 after the Daily Caller published an article that was headlined, “Is the Postal Service Declaring a War on Religion?” The article warned consumers to not expect new Christmas stamps this year because “for the first time in decades” USPS would not be issuing a new Christmas stamp depicting Christian religious figures or symbols: In 45 of the last 50 years, the postal service has printed new images for each Christmas season, including Mary, angels, wise men, Nativity scenes, the Star of David and even Santa Claus. But this year, all of them have been banished from the production presses. Four of the five years without new religious images came since the year 2000. The other was in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter. Christians will have to settle for a new stamp series called “A Charlie Brown Christmas” — including Linus kneeling by a scrawny Christmas tree, Snoopy and children ice skating, Charlie Brown checking his mail box, Linus leaning on a snowy brick wall and Charlie Brown standing in front of Snoopy’s doghouse. There will be one with Charlie Brown and a Christmas tree. From there, the rumor that 2015 would be the last year to buy Christmas stamps, and that the post office had declared war on Christmas, spread to social media sites. A November 12, 2015, Facebook post that had been shared thousands of times warned that this would be the last year for consumers to purchase religious Christmas stamps at the post office: The Post Office said to please spread the word … so I am. I went to purchase my stamps for Christmas cards this year, she informed me this would be the last year we would ever be able to purchase religious stamps. The government has now made it to where the United States Post Office will no longer be allowed to sale religious stamps… First, let’s take a look at the Daily Caller article that questioned whether the post office was declaring a war on religion by banning religious Christmas stamps. The claim that “four of the five years without religious images came since the year 2000” is false. A look back at the USPS stamp archive shows that new religious stamps were not issued in two years over that span: 2000 and 2005. In 2005, many post offices offered the 2004 Madonna and Child by Lorenzo Monaco stamp. For years, the postal service released two sets of Christmas stamps each year. One would feature Christian symbols and features, and the other would feature non-religious holiday themes like snowflakes, for example. USPS stamp services Director Mary-Anne Penner announced in August 2015 that the postal service planned to issue some sets of holiday stamps during alternating years, instead of annually, according to the website Linn’s Stamp News & Insights . USPS spokesperson Mark Saunders later indicated that the reason for issuing some sets of Christmas stamps in alternating years was due to available inventory of stamps on hand. In a letter to the Daily Caller , Saunders wrote: We have more than a half billion religious-themed holiday stamps in inventory and based on prior year’s purchases, that’s more than twice sold during a typical Holiday season. Our decision to print select holiday-themed stamps every other year is a business decision based on supply and demand while serving the needs of our customers. Moreover, we have found that the popularity of Holiday Forever stamps – which are good for mailing a one ounce letter anytime in the future regardless of price changes – result in more stamps purchased at a time. Saunders added that many customers had been mislead into believing that they would be unable to purchase religious holiday stamps in 2015, but that wasn’t the case. In the USPS online stamp shop, however, Saunders said you’ll find: Religious-themed Forever holiday stamps available this year include: Christmas Magi; Eid; Hanukkah; Holy Family; Madonna of the Candelabra by Raphael; and, Virgin and Child by Jan Gosseart. Secular Forever stamps include: A Charlie Brown Christmas (available Oct. 1); Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer; Geometric Snowflakes (available Oct. 23); Winter Fun; Global Holiday: Silver Bells Wreath; Global Holiday: and Evergreen Wreath. It’s true that the only new set of Christmas stamps released was “ A Charlie Brown Christmas .” That doesn’t mean, however, that you won’t be able to buy religious Christmas stamps at the post office, or that the post office has declared war on religion.

"," It’s true that laminin proteins play a critical role in sustaining life, and it’s also true that laminin proteins are shaped like crosses. Laminins are a family of large “multidomain glycoproteins” that play an important role at the cellular level of every living human and animal. As so-called “basement membranes,” laminin are responsible for critical functions at the cellular level. Things like stimulating growth and communication between cells is done by laminin, according to an academic article published by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology . And laminin pictures circling the web show a protein molecule in the shape of a crucifix, which is actually what laminin protein looks like. The academic article explains that laminin’s cross shape makes it “well suited for mediating between distant sites on cells and other components of the extracellular matrix.” A true image of laminin would show a rod-like molecule in a “cruciform shape” — but an imperfect one. Biophysics researchers found that laminin had three “short” arms and one longer arm, giving laminin a cross-like shape. Further research found, however, that one of the shorter arms is longer than the other two, which gives laminin protein a cruciform shape, but an imperfect one. So, because laminin cells are critical to life, and because laminin is shaped like a cross, we’re classifying this rumor as true. ","Religious"

"Jesus Has Been Removed from Starbucks Christmas Cups, Sparking a War on Christmas-Mostly Fiction!","2015-11-09 07:51:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jesus-removed-from-starbucks-christmas-cups-sparking-a-war-on-christmas/"," Jesus and other Christian symbols have been removed from 2015 Starbucks Christmas cups. "," Starbucks Christmas cups have never featured Jesus or other religious symbols, so the idea that they have been “removed” this year is false. The 2015 Starbucks Christmas cup was unveiled in October. The cup features a “two-toned ombre design, with a bright poppy color on top that shades intoa darker cranberry below, the company said on its website: Since 1997 Starbucks has served its holiday beverages in a unique cup, starting with a jazz-themed design in jewel tones of deeper reds, greens and blues. Every year since, the cup has told a story of the holidays by featuring symbols of the season from vintage ornaments and hand-drawn reindeer to modern vector-illustrated characters. “In the past, we have told stories with our holiday cups designs,” said Fields. “This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.” In the nearly two decades since the first red Starbucks cup, the company has grown from 1,400 stores in a handful of countries to more than 22,000 stores in 68 markets around the world. “Starbucks has become a place of sanctuary during the holidays,” he said. “We’re embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it. It’s more open way to usher in the holiday.” Since the Starbucks Christmas cup was released in 1997, it has never featured religious symbols . The fist year of Starbucks Christmas cup featured a seasonal jazz scene. Another early design featured hand-drawn reindeer. More recently, in 2009, the Starbucks Christmas cup featured pine needles and general words printed on ornaments like “wish” and “hope.“ In 2010, the Starbucks Christmas cup featured carolers. In 2011, Starbucks Christmas cups featured a boy and dog sledding down a hill. In 2014, the Starbucks Christmas cup was strikingly similar to this year’s all-red cup, but it also had abstract brush strokes in the background. So, the idea that Jesus and other Christian symbols have been “removed” from Starbucks Christmas cups this year aren’t true because religous symbols have never been featured on Starbucks Christmas cups. Rumors that Jesus and Christian symbols had been removed from Starbucks Christmas cups this year were started by a viral video posted by a former pastor named Joshua Feuerstein. Holding up the two-toned red Starbucks Christmas cup, Feuerstein said that Jesus had been removed from this year’s Starbucks Christmas cups and encouraged customers to tell baristas their name is “Merry Christmas” to trick them into writing it on the Starbucks Christmas cups: “Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups? That’s why they’re just plain red. In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn’t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers? …And guess what. Starbucks, I tricked you into putting Merry Christmas on your cup. And I’m challenging all great Americans and Christians around this great nation: Go into Starbucks and take your own coffee selfie.” In response, Starbucks said its 2015 Christmas cups are intended to be a “blank canvas” that encourages “customers to tell their Christmas stories in their own way.” So, it’s true that Starbucks Christmas cups don’t say “Merry Christmas,” or feature any Christian references, but that’s not a new development. The company hasn’t featured Christian symbols on its Christmas cups since they were first unveiled in 1997. ","Religious"

"," It’s true that two Muslim truck drivers were awarded $240,000 after the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a wrongful termination lawsuit on their behalf. A jury in Illinois ordered the Star Transport to pay the fired drivers $240,000 in damages in October 2015. The EEOC announced in May 2013 that it filed a lawsuit against Start Transport for failing to accommodate and wrongfully terminating two Muslim employees who refused to deliver alcohol for religious reasons, according to a press release : The lawsuit alleged that Star Transport refused to provide two employees with an accommodation of their religious beliefs when it terminated their employment because they refused to deliver alcohol. According to EEOC District Director John P. Rowe, who supervised administrative investigation prior to filing the lawsuit, “Our investigation revealed that Star could have readily avoided assigning these employees to alcohol delivery without any undue hardship, but chose to force the issue despite the employees’ Islamic religion.” …John Hendrickson, the EEOC Regional Attorney for the Chicago District Office said, “Everyone has a right to observe his or her religious beliefs, and employers don’t get to pick and choose which religions and which religious practices they will accommodate.  If an employer can reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious practice without an undue hardship, then it must do so. That is a principle which has been memorialized in federal employment law for almost50 years, and it is why EEOC is in this case.” U.S. District Court Judge James Shadid found in favor of the EEOC, and a jury awarded the fired truck drivers $240,000 in damages on October 22, 2015, according to an agency press release : EEOC alleged that in 2009, Star Transport fired Mohamed and Bulshale after they were required to transport alcohol. Both men told Star Transport that they believed doing so would violate their religious beliefs under Islamic law. EEOC also alleged that Star Transport could have but failed to accommodate the truckers’ religious beliefs, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC filed suit (EEOC v. Star Transport, Inc., No. 13-cv-1240) in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois in Peoria in May 2013. “EEOC is proud to support the rights of workers to equal treatment in the workplace without having to sacrifice their religious beliefs or practices,” said EEOC General Counsel David Lopez. “This is fundamental to the American principles of religious freedom and tolerance.” The case was litigated by EEOC Trial Attorneys Aaron DeCamp and June Calhoun and Supervisory Trial Attorney Diane Smason. Calhoun said, “This is an awesome outcome. Star Transport failed to provide any discrimination training to its human resources personnel, which led to catastrophic results for these employees. They suffered real injustice that needed to be addressed. By this verdict, the jury remedied the injustice by sending clear messages to Star Transport and other employers that they will be held accountable for their unlawful employment practices. Moreover, they signaled to Mr. Mohamed and Mr. Bulshale that religious freedom is a right for all Americans.” Smason stated, “We are pleased that the jury recognized that these — and all —employees are entitled to observe and practice their faith, no matter what that might be.” Bulshale commented, “This case makes me proud to be American.” The crux of the EEOC case was that Star Transport could have accommodated the fired truck drivers’ religious beliefs, but chose not to. The agency also successfully argued that the company had failed to provide anti-discrimination training that could have prevented the situation, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which reads: …A description of the qualifications in terms of training and experience relating to equal employment opportunity for the principal and operating officials of each such department, agency, or unit responsible for carrying out the equal employment opportunity program and of the allocation of personnel and resources proposed by such department, agency, or unit to carry out its equal employment opportunity program. The lawsuit sparked outrage among conservatives who argued that the Muslim truck drivers had been treated differently than Kim Davis, the county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples because of her religious beliefs. Eugene Volokh, a columnist for the Washington Post , explained the discrepancy in the treatment of Kim Davis and the Muslim truck drivers in an opinion piece : First, a technical but important legal point: Title VII expressly excludes elected officials. But Kentucky, like about 20 other states, has a state Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) statute that requires government agencies to exempt religious objectors from generally applicable laws, unless denying the exemption is the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest. The federal government also has a RFRA, which may apply to federal court orders issued to state elected officials. The case against Kim Davis argues that as an elected official Davis has a constitutional duty to issue marriage licenses that she cannot get a religious exemption for. The case also argues that Davis had infringed on the gay couple’s constitutional rights by not allowing them to get married. So, in short, because Kim Davis is an elected official with a constitutional responsibility to issue marriage licenses, she doesn’t have the same right to religious objections as private sector employees like the Muslim truck drivers do.

"The Orlando Airport Has Opened a Muslim Prayer Room-Truth!","2015-10-15 10:59:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-orlando-airport-has-opened-a-muslim-prayer-room/"," There’s a Muslim prayer room located at Orlando International airport. "," It’s true that Orlando International airport opened a reflection and prayer room for Muslim travelers in September 2015. The decision to open the prayer room came after Emirates airlines added nonstop air service from Dubai to Orlando. The first Emirates airlines flight from Dubai landed at Orlando International airport on September 1, 2015. That’s the same day that the Orlando airport’s new Islamic prayer and reflection room opened for service. Orlando became Emirates’ 10th connection in the United States. The airline has service to airports in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Washington D.C., New York and Boston. The only airport (aside from Orlando) that has an exclusive Muslim prayer and reflection room is John F. Kennedy International airport in New York City. Other airports have interfaith chapels for prayer and reflection. Orlando International airport director Phil Brown told the Orland Sentinel in a statement that Orland has become a global community, and “we want to be able to accommodate and provide high-quality amenities for all our passengers.” The Rev. Robert Susann, chaplain of the Orlando International airport interfaith chapel, said the Muslim prayer room was a needed addition: “We try to cover everybody,” Susann said. “We’re doing the best we can.” He called the reflection room a good idea, especially its location on Airside 4, where Dubai-based Emirates will be located, along with several other international carriers. “That’s handier for them,” Susann said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Orlando said that prior to the addition of the Islamic prayer room, Muslim passengers had to do daily prayers in terminals and public restrooms. The airport spent $350,000 on the Muslim prayer room, according to the organization . ","Religious"

"," ESPN hasn’t banned on-air mentions of God. Following a college football game between Clemson and Notre Dame, Clemson coach Dabo Sweeny’s interview was cut short immediately as soon as he mentioned the “good Lord”: The rumor that ESPN had cut Sweeny’s interview short because of the network’s ban on on-air mentions of God quickly gained momentum. The website NewsBusters, an off-shoot of the conservative Media Research Center, reported: As we have written here before, there is a gag order on God in the sports media. In the ending of Saturday night’s Notre Dame vs. Clemson game proved this point once again. As soon as victorious Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney mentioned God in his post-game on the field interview, ESPN ordered the Code Red. Soon, various blog sites picked up on the report, and many people were wondering why ESPN cut from a coach thanking God to anchors playing on iPads in the studio. Keri Potts, the senior director of public relations at ESPN, took to Twitter to clear the air: Potts also pointed out that a full, unedited version of the interview with Coach Sweeny was available at ESPN’s website. So, aside from one instance in which ESPN inadvertently cut an interview short as soon as a coach mentioned God, there’s no evidence that the network has banned mentions of God. In fact, a quick search of the website turns up hundreds of pages of stories and audio clips that include mentions of God. ","Religious"
"Angola Becomes the First Country to Ban Islam-Mostly Truth!","2015-10-02 09:29:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/angola-becomes-the-first-country-to-ban-islam/"," Angola has become the first country to ban Islam. "," Angola has not officially banned Islam, but the religion is not legally recognized in the country. The report that Angola became the first country to ban Islam can be traced back to a French newspaper report from 2013. A (roughly) translated version of La Nouvelle Tribune’s story reads : The Minister of Culture, Rosa Cruz went in the same direction by stating that: “Islam legalization process has not been approved by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, their mosques would be closed until further notice “. We must remember that the country is made up to 95% Christian and has a rather Christian culture. The government has therefore decided to destroy the long-term, the mosques of countries deemed illegal, Islam is not considered a full-fledged religion in the country. Last October, the minaret of a mosque attended primarily by Guinean was dismantled. In the urban district of Zango, the municipality would have gone further by destroying the only mosque in the city. That report was picked up by a number of English-language publications. Many of these stories continue to be forwarded and read as “breaking news” two years later. After the reports went viral back in 2013, the Angolan Embassy in Washington, D.C., issued a statement denying the claim that Angola had banned Islam: “The Republic of Angola … is a country that does not interfere in religion. We have a lot of religions there. It is freedom of religion. We have Catholic, Protestants, Baptists, Muslims and evangelical people.” But the idea that Angola “does not interfere in religion” is false. Religious groups there are required to register with the government, and they must have at least 100,000 members to be recognized and licensed, according to the Angolan Embassy: The Government requires religious groups to petition for legal status with the Ministries of Justice and Culture. Legal status gives religious groups the right to act as juridical persons in the court system, secures their standing as officially registered religious groups, and allows them to construct schools and churches. Groups must provide general background information and have at least 100,000 adult adherents to qualify for registration. This high membership threshold poses a barrier to registration and the accompanying benefits of legal status. The Ministries of Justice and Culture recognize 85 denominations but did not register any religious groups during the reporting period. More than 800 other religious organizations, many of which are Congolese or Brazilian-based Christian evangelical groups, had registration applications pending with INAR, which did not process them, as the groups failed to demonstrate that they had at least 100,000 members. Nonetheless, the Government did not bar the activities of these groups. The Guardian reports that that because there are only 90,000 Muslims in Angola, Islam did not meet the threshold for “legal status” as a religious organization, and therefore could not operate mosques or schools under the law: David Já, president of the Islamic Community of Angola (ICA), said on Thursday: “We can say that Islam has been banned in Angola. You need 100,000 to be recognised as a religion or officially you cannot pray.” There are 78 mosques in the country, according to the ICA, and all have been closed except those in the capital, Luanda, because they are technically unlicensed. “The mosques in Luanda were supposed to be closed yesterday but because of an international furore about reports that Angola had banned Islam, the government decided not to,” Já said. “So, at the moment, mosques in Luanda are open and people are going for prayers.” In a report on religious freedom in Angola , the U.S. State Department found that the Angolan government had closed and destroyed a number of “unlicensed” mosques in 2013: Although government officials asserted the government protected religious groups without legal status and did not have a policy to close mosques or other Islamic facilities, leaders of the Muslim community reported greater levels of government harassment than in past years, mostly in the form of police closing or demolishing “illegal” mosques. In September the leader of CISA stated that the government had closed or destroyed at least nine mosques throughout the country during the year. He said that when members of the Muslim community asked for an explanation the authorities cited “superior orders” and sometimes simply flashed a piece of paper. He stated the authorities never allowed community leaders to keep a copy of the orders or, in most cases, even read them. Luanda police destroyed a mosque in the Zango neighborhood of Luanda in October. According to official government statements, the local Islamic community had illegally acquired the land on which they had built the mosque. According to CISA, the Islamic community legally acquired the land in 2008, began construction in 2010, and finished the mosque during the year. Police first informed the mosque leaders of the illegality of the mosque on September 26 and arrived to destroy it on October 3. So, Islam has not been officially banned in Angola, but Muslims are not allowed to build or operate mosques and schools there because Islam is not an legally recognized religious group. ","Religious"

"," A fake news website is behind this false report. A story published by National Report spread the rumor that a high school in Tempe, Arizona, had required all female students to wear traditional Muslim dress after a student was bullied there: A high school in Tempe, Arizona is forcing all of their female students to wear hijabs — traditional Muslim headwear for women — for one full month, after the parents of a bullied 10th grade student complained to the Tempe School Board last week. From March 2nd through April 3rd, all female students will be required to wear the headscarves, regardless of their personal views on religion. District officials say the female students will each be given a hijab, as well as pamphlets on bullying and bigotry. Those students who choose not to wear the Muslim garb will face detention or even suspension. The decision came after a 10th grade student was cornered in the girls’ locker room by five other students, none of whom have yet been identified by the school district. The school’s principal alleges that those female students stole the girl’s hijab, verbally assaulted her with racial epithets, and physically pinned her against a locker while one student wiped her backside with the hijab, before physically forcing her to wear it again. The story was shared more than 8,000 times and sparked many to comments that the school’s decision was a way to “indoctrinate” the youth: I certainly agree that was an awful thing to do to the Muslim student. But these students (not the whole school, as mentioned) should be punished for this bullying but in no way should all the girl students have to wear scarves like a Muslim, which is entirely wrong. Where has the common sense gone from the schools, government, etc. Things such as this are getting to be more and more of a battle. Maybe all girl students should carry a Bible to school along with wearing the scarves to get the message across.

"," Pope Francis did not warn that future events would bring hellfire from above to earth in a sermon at Saint Peter’s Square. That false reported was started by the fake news website Real News, Right Now. In a story headlined “Pope Francis warns of ‘hellfire from above’ ahead of U.S. visit,” the website reports : VATICAN CITY – During a sermon at Saint Peter’s Square on Sunday, Pope Francis spoke of a “forthcoming event in which the earth will be consumed by hellfire from above” and asked Christians around the world to absolve themselves of sin in the days and weeks ahead. In a statement released by the Vatican Tuesday morning, Pope Francis, who is scheduled to arrive in the United States on September 22nd, announced that he has been visited “on three occasions by heavenly beings” who, most recently, have warned of an “impending crisis” that could have dire consequences for life on earth. The Pope is set to attend a meeting of the UN General Assembly on September 25th, at the United Nations building in New York where he will confer with world leaders, including President Barack Obama and Russian president Vladimir Putin, to discuss defensive options… Unlike many fake news websites, Real News, Right Now doesn’t clearly identify its stories as satirical or fake. Rather, the website takes a more subtle approach to “out” its publisher/author as a satirist: Hobbus J.D. is an internationally acclaimed independent investigative journalist specializing in international politics, health, business, science, conflict resolution, history, geography, mathematics, social issues, feminism, space travel, civil rights, human rights, animal rights, fashion, film, astronomy, classic literature, religion, biology, paranormal activity, the occult, physics, psychology, and creative writing. He has appeared in countless publications including Time Magazine, Newsweek, Playboy, The Economist, The New York Times, Mad Magazine, Hustler, Guns & Ammo, People, Maxim Magazine, Highlights, The 9/11 Commission Report, The New Yorker, Bon Appetite, Rolling Stone, Car & Driver, Soldier of Fortune, Elle, Nintendo Power, National Geographic, and many more. He has received numerous awards for his work including the prestigious Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity (2011), The Oscar Mayer Award for Journalistic Excellence (2003), three Nobel Peace Prize nominations, one Pulitzer in Investigative Reporting (1998), and two Pulitzer Prizes in Commentary (1996, 2008). He resides comfortably in his modest home overlooking the coast of Nantucket surrounded by his wife and twelve cats. That description doesn’t clearly identify the website as a purveyor of fake news, but it’s full of tongue-and-cheek references that tell the story: Stephen Glass is a disgraced journalist who made up stories, and Oscar Meyer is one of the world’s biggest producers of baloney, for example. The fictional report that Pope Francis had warned of hellfire from above plays off actual, earlier comments that the pope made about climate change. At the time, Pope Francis said , “Doomsday predictions can longer be met with irony or disdain.” But did Pope Francis urge the world to repent for their sins before a future event sends hellfire from above? The answer is “no.” We reviewed transcripts of Pope Francis’s sermons at Saint Peter’s Square and couldn’t find any reference to “hellfire from above” — or to climate change in general for that matter — in the weeks leading up to the fictional report published by Real News, Right Now .

"," Will Smith donated $150,000 to a rally commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March that is co-organized by a leader of the Nation of Islam group. Minister Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam , announced that Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith had made a $150,000 donation to help support the rally in a Facebook post : Last night in Philadelphia, the Honorable Louis Farrakhan announced that he called upon Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith to support 10-10-15. And he said the couple happily donated $150,000 to offset the cost of hosting the upcoming historic gathering! Will Smith attended the Million Man March in 1995. The rally is planned for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on October 10, 2015. The theme is “Justice or Else!” The purpose of the rally is to support racial equality, and it’s not geared toward any one religion, according to its promotional materials : If there were justice, there would be no need for a judgment. So, the only reason that the Bible and Qur’an talks about a Day of Judgment is because the wicked have denied the people that great principle of justice, fair dealing, in an equitable manner. Jesus said it perfectly, “God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth, the same shall he also reap.” Obadiah the Prophet says, “As thou hast done, so shall it be done unto you.” We are living in the day of Justice and Judgment and that’s why the cry everywhere is justice. All over our planet is complete dissatisfaction with government. The cry is not local or national but the cry for justice is universal!  The pain is national and global and the forces of evil are not willing to change while the ball is yet in their court to give justice, simple justice to those who cry out. Minister Louis Farrkham and Christian pastors announced the rally at the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, where black parishioners were murdered by a self-identified white supremacist: Farrakhan, who came to town with a large contingency of Nation of Islam members, shared the pulpit with AME church leaders as well as Rev. Willie Wilson, pastor of the Union Temple Baptist Church, and Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, who played a key role in the Million Man March on Oct 16, 1995. “When we look at 20 years ago, God showed us what can happen and what we can do when we are guided by divine direction” said Wilson, adding, “this time around, with the unity of all these ethnicities, all these races and all these people who are crying out, we expect that we can multiply what we did 20 years ago to make a great difference in this nation.” Although leaders of the Nation of Islam are involved in the rally, it’s an interfaith event that is organized by religious leaders of multiple faiths, so the claim that Will Smith donated $150,000 to a “Nation of Islam rally” is somewhat misleading. That’s why we’re classifying this one as mostly true. ","Religious"

That rumor started in 2013 after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz made a statement at a shareholder meeting about the company’s support of gay marriage, and it’s impact on the company’s profit margins. Conservative Starbucks investor Tom Strobhar told Schultz that the company’s earnings were “shall we say politely, a bit disappointing” in the first quarter after the National Organization for Marriage announced a boycott of Starbucks over its support of gay marriage. The Starbucks CEO responded : Despite the fact that you cite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38% shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, have returned 38% over the last 12 months. Having said that, it’s not an economic decision. The lens through which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ 200,000 people at this company, and we want to embrace diversity. Respectfully, if you can get a higher return than the 38% you got last year, it’s a free country; you can sell you shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. As the exchange made its way through the grapevine, it was (falsely) reported that the Starbucks CEO had said, “If you support traditional marriage, we don’t want your business.” Then, in March 2015, the Tea Party News Network breathed new life into the story when it re-reported the exchange as though it had just happened in a story headlined, “Starbucks CEO: If You are Anti-Gay Marriage, ‘You can Sell Your Shares.” That report is outdated and false.

Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama in 2010, didn’t specifically nix the hymn from halftime performances at Brandon High School in Mississippi. But the Rankin County School Board announced it had decided to strike the hymn because of Reeves’s injunction against religious activities at the school: The order states: ‘Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event. That means administrators, teachers and staff of the Rankin County School District may not participate in any religious activity, or solicit or encourage religious activities at school or while performing duties as a RCSD employee.’ If we were to perform this show, taking a chance of how it would be perceived by others, and the court deems it is in violation of previous rulings, not only would the Rankin County School District face harsh fines, but also RCSD would be forced to terminate the employment of anyone associated with the decision to perform the show. Reeves issued the order in response to a lawsuit that was filed in 2013 against the Rankin County School District over Christian assemblies held at schools in the district. The school board agreed that it had violated the student’s First Amendment rights and settled the lawsuit. The student received $7,500 in the settlement, plus attorney fees. An order issued by Reeves also said the district would pay a $10,000 fine per violation going forward, the Clarion-Ledger reports . Fox News reported that community members protested the hymn’s removal from the halftime show at the first football game of the year by singing the hymn from the bleachers: During halftime of Friday night’s game – a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song. “Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang. Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance. “We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.” She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium. Even though Judge Reeves didn’t single out the marching band’s performance of a hymn during halftime, we’re calling this one mostly true since his order compelled the school board to remove it.

Claims that the NIV Bible has cut 64,000 words, or 45 complete verses, have been around for decades. They’re not the result of a “new” edition released by HarperCollins. They started in the early 1990s when author Gail Riplinger stumped for exclusive use of the King James Bible in her book “New Age Bible Versions.” Riplinger often repeated the claim on television appearances promoting her book. Then, in July 2015, the eRumor went viral when singer Erica Campbell posted a meme on her Facebook page that quickly generated 100,000 shares: Hello beloved saints, I’m sure you know that NIV was published by Zondervan but is now OWNED by Harper Collins who also publishes the Satanic Bible and The Joy of Gay Sex. The NIV has now removed 64,575 words from the Bible including Jehovah, Calvary, Holy Ghost and omnipotent to name a few… The NIV has also now removed 45 complete verses. Most of us have the Bible on our devices and phones. Try and find these scriptures in NIV on your computer, phone or device right now if you are in doubt: Matthew 17.21, 18:11, 23:14; Mark 7:16, 9:44, 9:46: Luke 17:36, 23:17; John 5:4; Acts 8:37 …you will not believe your eyes Refuse to be blinded by Satan, and do not act like you just don’t care. Let’s not forget what the Lord Jesus said in John 10:10 (King James Version) Again, it’s undisputable that there are differences between the NIV Bible and King James Bible. Also, it’s true that HarperCollins Christian publishes the NIV Bible — but the publishing house isn’t responsible for the translation or “cutting” 45 verses from it. Biblica ministry is the group that translates the NIV Bible from original Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts. It was founded in New York in the 1800s to translate Scriptures so that U.S. immigrants could study them. In 1965, a group of evangelical scholars began translating original manuscripts of the Bible into contemporary English for what would become the first version of the NIV Bible. The updated (and most recent version) of the NIV Bible was released in 2011. Biblica denies that HarperCollins, or any other group, has editorial control over the translation: The text of the NIV is entrusted to the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT), a self-governing body of 15 evangelical Bible scholars. No outside group — no publisher or commercial entity — can decide how the NIV is translated. In keeping with the original NIV charter, the CBT meets every year to monitor developments in biblical scholarship, as well as changes in English usage. Every year, they solicit (and receive) input from scholars, pastors, missionaries, and laypeople. Also, Zondervan (the division of HarperCollins Christian that publishes the NIV Bible) disputes that there are any missing verses at all: Often times, readers will come across what they feel are “missing verses” in their NIV Bible. These verses, however, are not really missing. They are included in the footnotes on the same page of the Bible where the “missing” passage is located. During the exacting translation process for the NIV Bible, some verses were found not to be included in the oldest or most reliable manuscripts that the NIV translators had available to use. Most of these manuscripts were discovered after the King James Version was first translated, some 400 years ago. When those verses could not be verified by the more reliable or older manuscripts, the NIV translators moved them to a footnote to reflect greater accuracy. Please be assured that your NIV Bible is extremely accurate, trustworthy and reliable. Additional information on the translation process and use of footnotes is located in the Preface of your NIV Bible. If you have any other questions, please let us know. Debate over different versions of the Bible have persisted for centuries, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon. Many different versions of the Bible have been translated into English, and new translations continue today: The first complete English-language version of the Bible dates from 1382 and was credited to John Wycliffe and his followers. But it was the work of the scholar William Tyndale, who from 1525 to 1535 translated the New Testament and part of the Old Testament, that became the model for a series of subsequent English translations. All previous English translations culminated in the King James Version(1611; known in England as the Authorized Version), which was prepared by 54 scholars appointed by King James I. Avoiding strict literalism in favour of an extensive use of synonym, it was a masterpiece of Jacobean English and the principal Bible used by English-speaking Protestants for 270 years. About the time of the invention of printing in ad 1450, there were only 33 different translations of the Bible. By about 1800 the number had risen to 71; by the late 20th century the entire Bible had been translated into more than 250 languages, and portions of the Bible had been published in more than 1,300 of the world’s languages. New translations of the Bible into English proliferated in the 20th century. So, it’s true that there are big differences between the NIV Bible and the King James Bible (as well as every other translation of the Bible) — but the idea that the NIV Bible has cut 64,000 words, or 45 complete verses, is disputed.

"," Pope Francis hasn’t announced plans to revise the Ten Commandments. hat false report started with the website Real News, Right Now . The website, which is known for publishing fictional “news” stories, reported that Pope Francis made the announcement in South America in July 2015: During his sermon, Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had called upon him, instructing him “to revise the most sacred of texts, the Ten Commandments.” Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices. Pope Francis said Christians around the world are “faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society.” The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments. The Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards one’s parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend “God’s grace to all His children.” The report also claimed that the Fifth Commandment would be revised to forbid Christian from eating genetically modified food, and a new Eleventh Commandment would make “selfie” photos a sin. Real News, Right Now doesn’t identify itself as a fake news website, and it’s stories are based loosely in factual events, which often misleads readers. In this case, Pope Francis did in fact hold mass in Ecuador, and he talked about family values, but he didn’t say that God had instructed him to revise the Ten Commandments, the New York Times reports : Francis never mentioned gays or the divorced directly on Monday , but many analysts believe he wants to push the church to take a more accommodating stance. Pope Francis and Catholic Church leaders were set to discuss family values during a meeting planned at the Vatican in October 2015, according to the agenda . Leaders were scheduled to discuss whether divorcees should be allowed to receive the Holy Sacrament, and how the church should receive gay men and women. But, again, Pope Francis didn’t say that God had instructed him to revise the 10 Commandments, or add an Eleventh Commandment, as the eRumor claims. ","Religious"

"," This is yet another hoax about so-called Islamic extremism in Dearborn, Michigan. The hoax was started by The People’s Cube , the fake news website that (falsely) reported that Rosie O’Donnel had gotten an ISIS tattoo. This time, the website reported that President Obama had signed an executive order to allow an ISIS-supporting Islamic youth outreach center to open in Dearborn: Following months of obstruction by state officials, the federal government intervened on behalf of a Muslim group who is outspokenly supportive of the Islamic State, to open the doors of a new Islamic youth outreach center in a lower-income area in the city of Dearborn. The facility will be run by Syrian-born Aisha Hani-Salaam, a recent immigrant and unapologetic supporter of ISIS. President Obama, who signed the executive order to allow the center, said, “We need to take advantage of every opportunity to end the violence between our people. Hopefully this will start a new era in relations between the United States and the religion of Islam. Muslims are understandably angry over the Western media’s overblown portrayal of ISIL as merciless killers. I believe this is a good opportunity to end the fighting and use diplomacy to usher in a new era of peace, as well as gain a powerful new ally in that part of the world.” Despite the President’s hopeful and reassuring message, Hani-Salaam remains angry and openly criticizes some American Muslims for their ‘lukewarm’ traditional condemnations of the United States. Within days of publication, the story had been shared more than 30,000 times on social media sites. Taken out of context, many were duped into believing the story was true. Dearborn has been at the center of a number of hoaxes about Islamic extremism. It’s a popular target because it has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world outside of the Middle East. About 100,000 people live in Dearborn, and about 40,000 of them are Arab-Americans. TruthorFiction.com has previously investigated false reports that Sharia law had been declared in Dearborn , and that a sign there warned Allah would kill America . The report that President Obama had signed an executive order to open an Islamic youth outreach center that supports ISIS is yet another hoax.

And it’s true that Isis is a common name in the Netherlands. It has consistently ranked in the top 100 most popular names there. It’s fairly easy to tell the difference between the terrorist group and the female name, too.

"," It’s true that a number of cities have banned head coverings and long beards as part of a larger crackdown on religious extremism. But China has cracked down on Christianity and other religions in recent years, too. Reports of the “crackdown” first went viral in August 2014. Karamay, a city in the Xinjiang region of China, banned people wearing Islamic clothes or who had long beards from riding public buses. The ban was temporarily enforced during a local sports competition, but local officials had already “discouraged” Muslim dress before the law was passed, New Deli Television reports : “Xinjiang, a resource rich region which abuts central Asia, is the homeland of China’s mostly Muslim Uighur minority and has been hit by a wave of clashes between locals and security forces which have killed hundreds in the past year. China has blamed several deadly attacks on civilians outside the region in recent months on ‘terrorists’ seeking independence for the region.” Then, local authorities in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, banned Islamic veils in December 2014. Again, state-run media reported that the ban was part of a crackdown on a wave of violence in the region that had been attributed to Uighur militants who were helped by overseas terrorist groups, the BBC reports . So, this eRumor is true — but religious repression in China isn’t a new development. Officially, China declared itself as an atheist country in 1949 and “widespread religious repression” followed in Mainland China. But the country has experienced a “religious revival” over the last 40 years. The government recognizes Buddhism, Catholicism, Daoism, Islam and Protestantism as religions, but it identifies religious groups as threats to national security, the Council on Foreign Relations reports : “Christians have faced growing repression in recent years. China ranked twenty-ninth on the 2015 World Watch List compiled by Open Doors, a U.S.-based Christian non-profit, that tracks the persecution of Christians worldwide, up from thirty-seventh the previous year. Repression campaigns have not been consistent, but they have recently targeted both house and state-sanctioned churches—be it through the harassment and detention of Christian oberverants, blocking entry to sites of worship, interrupting gatherings, dismantling crosses, or demolishing churches. In 2014, party officials in the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang’s city of Wenzhou, known for its large Christian population, ordered the removal of hundreds of crosses and demolition of dozens of churches that allegedly violated construction regulations. In February 2015, Zhejiang party officials announced that the party would enforce a ban on religious belief among party members to prevent the ‘penetration of Western hostile forces.’ These campaigns raised fears of possible widespread action against Christianity, but they seem to have been isolated cases.” So, it’s true that cities in China have cracked down on Islam in recent years, but the same is true about Christianity and other religions.

Many teenagers have posted videos of what appears to be supernatural happenings after they used a makeshift Ouija board to summon Charlie, a so-called Mexican demon spirit. In the challenge, two pencils are placed on a piece of paper in the shape of a cross with the words “yes” and “no” written in all four corners of the cross. Then, the words “Charlie, Charlie can we play” are uttered to start the challenge. If the pencil drifts to “yes,” that supposedly means that a connection has been made with the demon, and players can ask him questions. As it turns out, the Charlie Charlie Challenge was a marketing stunt for a Warner Bros. movie called “ The Gallows .” After countless videos of the challenge went viral, an eight-second trailer that shows a clip of the Charlie Charlie Challenge from the movie was released. The movie, which was set for release in July 2015, is about a group of students in a small town who try to resurrect a school play that ended in tragedy 20 years earlier — and, of course, there are horrific consequences. Similar viral marketing campaigns have been successfully used in the past. A social media campaign for “ The Last Exorcism ” tricked people into believing that they were video chatting with a woman who was suddenly overtaken by a demon. Images of the people’s horrified reactions were used to market the movie. And the “ Blair Witch Project ” had one of the most successful viral marketing campaigns ever. Promoters logged onto online forums to spark urban legends about three filmmakers who disappeared while searching for a witch in Maryland. The move cost $20,000 to make and took in $248 million at the box office thanks to these viral marketing efforts. ","Religious"

Craig Olson spoke at a National Day of Prayer Task Force event on May 7, 2015. In a video of the address , Olson called himself a “redeemed believer in Christ” and continued: “…Flying complex aircraft; doing complex nuclear missions — I have no ability to do that. God enabled me to do that. He put me in charge of failing programs worth billions of dollars. I have no ability to do that, no training to do that. God did that. He sent me to Iraq to negotiate foreign military sales deals through an Arabic interpreter. I have no ability to do that. I was not trained to do that. God did all of that.” Craig Olson concluded by asking the audience to pray for Defense Department officials and said that they “need to humbly depend on Christ.” The address drew criticism from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation. The group claimed that Greg Olson’s address was a “propaganda bonanza for ISIS” and that Olson had defied Air Force code by “witnessing for Jesus in full uniform on worldwide TV and Internet.” Military Religious Freedom Foundation President Michael Weinstein called for Greg Olson to be “aggressive and very visibly” brought to justice via court martial in an open letter to the Air Force chief of staff. The letter cited a section of the Air Force Instruction that Olson had allegedly violated: “2.12. Balance of Free Exercise of Religion and Establishment Clause: Leaders at all levels must balance constitutional protections for their own free exercise of religion, including individual expressions of religious beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. They must ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing or disapproving of, or extending preferential treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of belief. (emphasis added) In light of your very own Air Force regulation, irrefutably on point with the matter herein, and the violation of which is proscribed as a potential FELONY under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, do you honestly NOT see any incredibly serious problems here with Olson’s statements, Mark? Please also note the controlling holding of the seminal 1974 Supreme Court case of Parker vs. Levy (417 U.S. 733), penned by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, significantly limiting the Constitutional rights of active duty military members (such as Major General Olson) vs. the same rights enjoyed by their American civilian counterparts. Additionally, Major General Olson has violated the No Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights as well as having constructively created a banned “religious test” in specific contravention of Clause 3, Article VI of the body of the United States Constitution. He is also providing an unlawful endorsement and selective benefit to a non-Federal entity (the NDPTF, which is a private organization), in violation of both the Joint Ethics Regulation (DoD 5500.7-R) prohibition on endorsement of non-Federal entities and DoD Instruction 5410.19, which prohibits the providing of a selective benefit or preferential treatment to any private organization, as well as violating a slew of other DoD directives, instructions, and regulations.” However, an Air Force spokesperson later said Maj.

"," This claim is inaccurate and outdated. In 2011, a law professor at Georgetown University named John Banzhaf filed a complaint against Catholic University of America (CUA) with the Office of Human Rights in Washington, D.C., that claimed Muslim students there had been discriminated against. The complaint was filed after the Washington Post published an article in 2010 on the growing number of students who have enrolled in Catholic universities, and the Catholic University of America in particular. In the report, a Muslim student talked about his efforts to start a Muslim student group on the campus: “It was that kind of exchange that prompted (the student’s) attempts to start a Muslim student association. He wanted to help Muslim students connect and gather for prayer in addition to helping spur conversations across religions. He found a faculty adviser and filled out the required paperwork but heard nothing back for a while. “Then, an administrator pulled him aside and said it wouldn’t work to have a Muslim group at such a major Catholic institution. When asked about the experience, (the student) is hesitant to say anything negative about a school that he says has embraced him so fully and given him a chance to grow in faith and academics. “’I understand the difficulty,’ he said. ‘In Iran, if you tried to start a Catholic group at a Muslim university, that would be just as strange and hard to make it work.’” John Banzhaf filed the discrimination complaint against Catholic University of America President John Garvey after reading the article: “There is no way that Catholic University can show that it is a ‘business necessity’ to discriminate against Muslim students by denying them access to the same benefits other student groups enjoy, especially since many Catholic universities, including nearby Georgetown University, permit associations of Muslim students, and courts have held that any such denial cannot lawfully be based even on the most deeply held religious beliefs. “…In addition, it is alleged that CUA does not provide space —as other universities do — for the many daily prayers Muslim students must make, forcing them instead to find temporarily empty classrooms where they are often surrounded by Catholic symbols which are incongruous to their religion. Furthermore, it appears that Muslims on campus may even be forced to do their meditation in the school’s chapels or in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception — hardly places where students of a very different religion are likely to feel very comfortable.” But the complaint didn’t gain support from Muslim students, The Christian Post reports : “Muslim students at CUA don’t seem as bothered as Banzhaf. In a written statement, university President John Garvey said, ‘No Muslim student at Catholic University has registered a complaint with the University about the exercise of their religion on campus.’ “Banzhaf admitted as much in an email to The Christian Post . He wrote, ‘At this point, the complaint is filed solely and only in my name.’” The complaint generated a lot of media coverage when it was filed in 2011. Many reports falsely claimed that Muslim students had sued Catholic University of America over its crucifixes — even though a non-Muslim professor at a different university had filed the complaint. Ultimately, the complaint faded from the headlines and nothing came of it, a university official told the National Catholic Register in a statement : “…This story is from 2011, nothing came of Mr. Banzhaf’s complaint, and our Muslim students are happy  — none of them supported the Banzhaf complaint and in fact they choose to attend the national university of the Catholic Church because they know that their faith and their expression thereof will be respected.” But years later, in May 2015, the old (and false) report that Muslim students had sued the Catholic University of America over its crosses was re-reported as new news by websites like Breitbart and Top Right News . These “new” articles all cited an undated and outdated report by the website Belief Net . Claims that Muslim students sued the Catholic University of America over its crosses are false and outdated.

Taken out of context, many readers commented on the story as though it were an actual news report: “If there is no noise ordnances in Birmingham, and apparently there is not, someone should match those speakers decibel per decibel and blast some ghetto rap music every time prayer call is broadcast.” But the disclaimer for British News website explains, “Most of the stories posted here are works of fiction, and you would have to be a moron to believe them.” The fake story likely generated such a strong response because it loosely mirrors an ongoing story in the U.K. about a “mega mosque” that is actually planned for the city of Dudley, the Birmingham Journal reports : “Controversial plans to build an £18 million ‘mega-mosque’ in Dudley have been given the go-ahead after a seven-year battle. Councillors voted through amended proposals put forward by the Dudley Muslim Association by a majority of 5-3, during a heated meeting last night. Dudley Council had originally rejected the original proposals in 2007. Police were stationed at the Council House before the meeting was due to get underway and protestors were left outside after all 50 public seats were taken. The decision paves the way for a 52ft high curved roof mosque with a 62ft minaret to be built in Hall Street. The complex, which was scaled down from previous plans, will also include a 120 space two-storey car park, a sports centre, an enterprise and education centre and a community centre. Opposition was raised about the size and design and the lack of parking in the area. The council had received 370 letters of support and a petition for the application with 1,718 signatures, while 885 letters were sent in against the plans.” But it should be noted that there are no plans to broadcast call to prayers over speakers that can reach 15 miles at the mosque in Dudley.

Over the years the company has sought to reassure inquirers that the trademarked pattern is just that — a pattern — with no intended anti-Jewish message.” The ADL said that it first contacted Vans about the Star of David rumor in the 1990s. The chief executive said at the time that the six-pointed star pattern on the shoes “was not done with even any awareness that it was the Star of David.” The Van Doren Rubber Company was founded in Anaheim, California, in 1966 by brothers Paul and James Van Doren. James designed a “high-grip shoe, conceived as a boat shoe, that would hold the wearer firmly to a pitching deck,” according to his obituary : “Mr. Van Doren collaborated with a chemist to develop the rubber recipe used in the sole. A mechanical engineer by training, he also devised its characteristic tread pattern: diamonds interrupted by a band of tiny six-pointed stars at the ball of the foot. Together, rubber and tread made the sole clingy.” Although the shoe was initially designed for boating, it’s high-grip rubber sole made it a popular choice for skateboarders in Southern California in the 1970s. Today, the Van Doren Rubber Company is known simply as “Vans.” ","Religious"
"ISIS Hit with Fleshing-Eating Plague-Truth! But Misleading!","2015-04-25 11:43:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/isis-hit-with-fleshing-eating-plague/"," ISIS terrorists in Syria have been stricken with a flesh-eating plague. "," It’s true that hundreds of ISIS fighters in Raqqa, Syria, have been stricken with a flesh-eating virus called leishmaniasis. However, the impact the virus has had on ISIS appeared to be exaggerated in reports that referred to it as a “plague.” America’s science envoy to the Middle East said in January 2015 that there was a “perfect storm” for outbreaks of infectious disease in the areas of Syria and Iraq that were under ISIS control, the Independent reports : “Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading global health expert, said an outbreak of leishmaniasis, a disfiguring disease spread by sand flies, was already ‘out of control’ in Syria, and he also warned about the rising risk posed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in a region where many hospitals have closed and disease surveillance control measures are hampered by fighting.” There had been a total of 100,000 cases of the flesh-eating virus reported in Syria by April 2015. It wasn’t clear how many ISIS fighters were infected. Many of the ISIS fighters who were infected, however, refused medical treatment, which led to even more outbreaks, the Mirror reports : “It causes large open wounds which eat away at flesh, is fatal if not treated with a simple course of medicine. But the jihadi fighters are refusing medical treatment, which has led to more outbreaks. People in the Islamic State’s capital Raqqa, in war-torn Syria, are at the highest risk. Doctors from non-government organization (NGO) Medecins Sans Frontieres were initially trying to curb the outbreaks but have now left since Islamic State set up. And other medical centers have closed down after medical staff fled the violence. Local medics who have very little experience of treating the virus are left to deal with patients, which has led to it spreading extensively.” The impact of the flesh-eating virus on ISIS isn’t known, but the terrorist group’s activity toward the end of April 2015 indicated that it was far from being wiped out. ISIS was engaged in “intense clashes” with Kurdish fighters, Business Insider reports . Medical have professionals warned that the flesh-eating virus could become a widespread epidemic in Syria, but that hadn’t appeared to have happened when this eRumor went viral. ","Religious"
"Priests Weren’t Allowed to Say Mass During Government Shutdown-Fiction!","2015-04-25 11:35:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/priests-werent-allowed-to-say-mass-during-government-shutdown/"," The government didn’t allow priests to say mass on some military bases during the government shutdown. "," There was talk about Catholic mass being canceled at some military bases during the government shutdown, but it never actually happened. John Schlageter, the general counsel for the Archdiocese for the Military Services, released a statement in October 2013 warning that mass could be canceled at some military bases if the government shutdown continued. The problem, as told by John Schlageter, was not that the government wouldn’t allow priests to say mass. The problem was that a shortage of Catholic chaplains on active duty in the military meant the government had to hire priests as general contractors. Because of the government shutdown contract priests weren’t allowed by law to work, even on a voluntary basis, Schlageter said: “There is a chronic shortage of active duty Catholic chaplains. While roughly 25% of the military is Catholic, Catholic priests make up only about 8% of the chaplain corps. That means approximately 275,000 men and women in uniform, and their families, are served by only 234 active-duty priests.  The temporary solution to this shortage is to provide GS and contract priests.   These men are employed by the government to ensure that a priest is available when an active duty Catholic Chaplain is not present.  With the government shutdown, GS and contract priests who minister to Catholics on military bases worldwide are not permitted to work – not even to volunteer.  During the shutdown, it is illegal for them to minister on base and they risk being arrested if they attempt to do so. “As an example, if a Catholic family has a Baptism scheduled at the base chapel this weekend, unless they can locate a priest who is not a GS or contract priest, they should consider it cancelled….  If you are a Catholic stationed in Japan or Korea and are served by a Contract or GS priest, unless you speak Korean or Japanese and can find a church nearby, then you have no choice but to go without Mass this weekend.  Until the Federal Government resumes normal operations, or an exemption is granted to contract or GS priests, Catholic services are indefinitely suspended at those worldwide installations served by contract and GS priests.” In the end, mass was not canceled at military bases because of the government shutdown. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reinstated civilian employees of the Defense Department, including contract priests, before that happened. President Obama had signed a stopgap budget to ensure that service members would receive pay during the government shutdown, and Hagel interpreted that the stopgap budget also applied to civilian defense employees.

"," There’s no proof that there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico. This isn’t the first time that the claim has been made, either. Reports that ISIS fighters were being smuggled into the U.S. from a camp in Mexico first surfaced in September of 2014. The website Judicial Watch made the initial report , but the page later disappeared from the website. At the time, a number of politicians and websites spread rumors of an ISIS camp located just south of El Paso. In a conference call with a conservative non-profit group, U.S. Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) said, “It is true that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez, or they were within the last few weeks.” Blog sites and publications repeated those claims, and the eRumor went viral. U.S. defense officials shot down the reports and said there was “no credible information” that ISIS planned to attack the U.S., the Guardian reports . Then, in a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing held in September of 2014, Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary Jennifer Lasley addressed the claim : “To date, we have not had credible reporting that either Hezbollah or any other terrorist group has been taking advantage of our borders to move individuals in an out. It’s something we are always looking for, but to date, we have not seen credible evidence of that.” Claims about the ISIS camp in Mexico faded away, and nothing ever came of it. Then, the exact same eRumor re-surfaced in April of 2015. Again, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS was camped in Mexico. Citing unnamed sources, the report said ISIS fighters were being shuttled into the U.S. by Mexican human traffickers. The report included a photo of a desert encampment. However, the photo doesn’t show an ISIS camp. The photo was taken in 2010, years before ISIS was formed. It shows a pre-school in Benito Juarez, Mexico. There’s currently no evidence that there’s an ISIS camp in Mexico, or that ISIS fighters are being smuggled into the U.S., so we are reporting this story as fiction.

Summary of the eRumor: Walmart has started a “watch list” for Christian employees in an effort to hush their religious views. "," Walmart does not have a “watch list” for Christian employees, a company spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com . Reports of the so-called watch list surfaced after Walmart CEO Doug McMillon spoke out against religious freedom legislation in Arkansas, where Walmart is headquartered. Opponents of the bill argue that it would allow businesses to discriminate against homosexuals. Its supporters argue that it would help ensure that religious freedoms are upheld. Doug McMillon said the bill threatened to undermine the “spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas, and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.” He asked Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto it. Days later, Gov. Hutchinson vetoed the bill and said it “would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech and freedom of the press.” Then, days after the veto, a blog appeared on the American Family Association’s (AFA) website under the headline, “Walmart Puts Christian Employees on ‘Watch List.’” The article discusses the company’s opposition to the religious freedoms bill and says: “Now that Walmart has shown its public support for laws that force Christians to violate their faith, every executive, every store manager, every department manager and every team leader is forced into silence. No longer are they free to express their religious faith with its biblical position on marriage and sexuality.” The blog later appeared on other websites like this one . We reached out to Walmart for comment and were told by a spokesperson, “There is no merit to the article, and the ‘watch list’ does not exist in any way, shape or form.” ","Religious"

Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, be covered when the chapel was not being used for Christian services. "," It’s true that Christian symbols were once covered by a curtain when Christian services were not being held in the chapel at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC, but that policy is no longer in place. The story went viral in the spring of 2014 after a number of news outlets reported that the VA facility in Iron Mountain was not in compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that requires houses of worship to be nonsectarian. The story went viral again in early 2015, so TruthorFiction.com followed up with staff at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC for an update. Bradley Nelson, the public affairs director at the facility, told TruthorFiction.com that the curtain was temporarily used to meet requirements outlined in the VA’s Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures that were issued in 2008. The policy states that the VA must “uphold the free exercise of religion by all medical, domiciliary, and nursing home patients in the health care facility.” “In keeping with this, it has been long standing policy that VA chapels not reflect any one denomination or faith when not being used for specific faith services or activities,” Nelson said. “This allows for our patients and their families who do not identify with the Christian faith to use the room for prayer, meditation or reflection according to their faith tradition. We were coming into compliance with this policy last spring and the person responsible for the Chapel thought the curtain would be the easiest way to do this, i.e., open it for chapel services and close it when not being used. Based on constructive feedback and what other VA medical centers have done, the curtains were taken down.” But VA medical facilities must still comply with the Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures. Today, Christian symbols are allowed in the main chapel while Protestant and Catholic services are being held, as well as 24/7 in the Holy Sacrament room located inside the chapel, Nelson said. “We have the smaller Holy Sacrament Room, which is dedicated solely to Christian worship and includes the crucifix, statues of Jesus and Mary, Stations of the Cross, Holy Water, stained glass windows, and other accoutrements found in churches, all of which remain in place 24/7,” Nelson said. “The room is available for anyone wishing to use it.” And there aren’t any specific directives that prohibit the use of scripture or religious items like the crucifix and statues of Jesus and Mary during worship services in the main chapel — but they can’t remain there 24/7. “These religious items are put away between chapel services, however, they are accessible for any group or individual wishing to use them in the chapel for their own prayer, meditation or worship,” Nelson said. Several versions of the Holy Bible and Catholic Rosaries are also available in the chapel. Nelson also provided a number of photos of the Oscar G.

"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","2015-03-30 18:09:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/germanwings-pilot-had-converted-to-islam/"," A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. "," There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there’s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings said in a statement that the crash “appeared” to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: “We are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to have been crashed deliberately – probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like this could occur within our company.” It’s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide. French authorities found a torn up sick note from a doctor that would have excused Andreas Lubitz from work on the day of the crash, but the reason for the note hasn’t been revealed. Germanwings said that Lubitz didn’t submit the sick note to them. German officials said that Andreas Lubitz had hid “an unspecified medical condition” from his employers, the Telegraph reports : “The fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional colleagues. “The prosecutors said in a statement that the documents were found in searches of Lubitz’s homes in Duesseldorf and in the town of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. “The Uniklinik hospital in Dusseldorf confirmed that it had treated Lubitz in recent weeks but said it was not for depression. “Meanwhile Bild, the German newspaper, reported that ‘Lubitz had a serious relationship crisis with his girlfriend before the disaster and the resulting heartbreak is thought to have led to this.’” Just before the crash, Andreas Lubitz’s pregnant girlfriend broke up with him. Her friends said Lubitz was a “tormented and erratic man” who suffered from unpredictable behavior and mood swings. He had also been having an affair with a Germanwings flight attendant in the months leading up to the crash, the Daily Mail reports . Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane. Sill, other theories claim that it was an act of terrorism and that Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam. One of those claims comes from the German blog site Pi-News: “All evidence indicates that the copilot of Airbus machine in his six-months break during his training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and subsequently either by the order of ‘radical,’ ie. devout Muslim , or received the order from the book of terror, the Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of the investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that he — as Mohammed Atta, in the attack against New York — received his instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.” That report has been repeated by a number of blog sites across the web. However, Pi-News isn’t a trustworthy news source. The website describes itself as against “the mainstream, America, Israel, basic and human laws and the fight against the Islamisation of Europe.” Officials in France and Germany have not said that the crash could have been an act of terrorism, but the investigation is ongoing.

Reports that “under god” had been left off cans of soda showed up after the 9/11 terrorists attacks. TruthorFiction.com investigated back then, and we found that Dr Pepper — not Pepsi — had in fact released a can of soda that said “One Nation … Indivisible” across the top. Click here for the story. Critics said that Dr Pepper left out “under god” because the company wanted to be politically correct. The led some to call for boycotts of the soda. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group responded : “In recent days, several news media outlets in the country have reported on a special edition Dr Pepper can that was created to show support for the patriotic fervor that has been sweeping America since the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, and to show the world that we are a united nation of people who place a high value upon freedom. Much of the information being circulated on this subject is incomplete or inaccurate. Here are the facts: “The can, released last November, features an image of the Statue of Liberty along with the words ‘One Nation … Indivisible.’ “The special packaging was designed to reflect our pride in this country’s determination to stand together as one. The Statue of Liberty and Pledge of Allegiance were chosen as two of the greatest symbols of American freedom. “Due to space limitations on the can, only a few of the 31 words from the Pledge of Allegiance could be used. The available area for graphics limited the amount of verbiage on the can. “Of the 31 words in the Pledge of Allegiance, only three were included. More than 90 percent were not included. “We at Dr Pepper/Seven Up strongly believe that the message on these cans is a resoundingly patriotic, bipartisan message that we are a united nation. “More than 41 million special edition cans were ordered by Dr Pepper bottlers in portions of a dozen states.  Because the limited edition patriotic can is to be retired in February, you will soon see regular packaging graphics for Dr Pepper at your local retail stores.” That should have settled it, but somehow the eRumor has changed over the years. Now chain emails urge people to boycott Pepsi because it supposedly left “under god” off its cans. That isn’t true. Pepsi responded directly: “You’ve received an erroneous email about a ‘patriotic can’ that Pepsi allegedly produced with an edited version of America’s Pledge of Allegiance. The truth is, Pepsi never produced such a can. In fact, this is a hoax that has been circulating on the Internet for more than six years. A patriotic package used in 2001 by Dr Pepper (which is not a part of PepsiCo) was inappropriately linked to Pepsi.

"," Claims that an assistant dean at Cornell said ISIS training exercises and speakers would be allowed there are disputed. A man posing as a student from Morocco used a hidden camera to record an exchange with Cornell Dean for Students Joseph Scaffido for Project Veritas , an organization founded by conservative activist James O’Keefe. In the video, the student asks Scaffido questions about starting a humanitarian group for distressed areas of the Middle East, bringing people to the campus to speak, and holding training exercises for “freedom fighters.” Here’s a transcript of the conversation: Student: I think maybe it would be nice to start a humanitarian group that supports distressed communities, a humanitarian group in the Middle East, in northern Iraq and Syria. I think it would be important especially for people in the Islamic State Iraq and Syria, the families and the freedom fighters in particular. I think it would be important to maybe just probably educate, but to maybe send them care packages, whether it be food, water, electronics. Scaffido: There are a lot of our student organizations that do things like that all over the world. Student: If you did like, supported like Hamas or something like that, is that a problem? Scaffido: The university is not going to look at different groups and say, ‘You’re not allowed to support that group because we don’t believe in them,’ or something like that. I think it’s just the opposite. I think the university wants the entire community to understand what’s going on in all parts of the world. Student: That would be good. Maybe, you know, get a group that educates on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and just educate people, maybe bring them in. Scaffido: Ithaca is a great place. Ithaca itself, the community of Ithaca is also very active. I don’t know if you’ve talked to many people about it, it’s very liberal; the community is a very liberal community … There are funding sources on campus … kind of like grants, programming money. If I wanted to bring in a speaker… Student: Maybe we could get like a freedom fighter to come and do like a training camp for students? Scaffido: I have no idea. I mean, you would be allowed to do something like that. It’s just like bringing in a coach to do training on a sports team or something. Scaffido definitely doesn’t say that these things wouldn’t be allowed on campus. But an unedited version of the video would be needed to understand his actual responses. After video of the interview went viral, Cornell officials shot back that it had been creatively edited to make Scaffido appear to endorse ISIS training camps and speakers on the campus. In a statement , Cornell University President David Skorton said the video’s allegations were ludicrous and offensive: “As the president of Cornell University, I want to be clear that the notion that Cornell would allow ISIS training sessions on our campus is ludicrous and absolutely offensive. “Project Veritas, the organization behind this shoddy piece of ‘journalism’ has been repeatedly vilified for dishonest, deceitful activity. It is shameful that any individual would pose as a student facing racial discrimination at another university, ask leading questions on hidden camera about Cornell’s tolerance for differing viewpoints and backgrounds, and then conveniently splice together the resulting footage to smear our assistant dean and our University. After speaking with Assistant Dean Scaffido, I am convinced that he was not aware of what he was being asked. “Let me be clear: Cornell has an unwavering commitment to the free and responsible exchange of ideas. However, we remain vigilant in maintaining an appropriate balance of freedom of expression within accepted boundaries. Of course, incitement to violence is not protected and would never be tolerated on our campus.” ","Religious"

The list had names, photos and home addresses of 100 military members, and it encouraged IS supporters to kill them on U.S. soil, Marine Corps Times reports . The Pentagon said that each military member on the list had been notified and was encouraged to “tighten up” their online privacy settings and social media accounts, NBC News reports . Authorities in Flagler County, Florida, were on alert after the FBI notified them that a number of the people on the so-called kill list lived in the area. Sheriff James Manfre said he had ordered extra patrols, WJXT Jacksonville reports : “I mean this is startling information to have and obviously they are concerned about their loved ones but again, we do not see it as a credible threat. We do not want to allow ISIS to spread terror in our community, yet we are going to make sure that we remain vigilant and let them understand that you fight one of us, you fight all of us,” Manfre said. Now, the biggest question is how IS supporters were able to get the names, photos and home addresses of military personnel that took part in attacks against the terrorist group. Admiral Cecil Haney, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, was asked during a press briefing whether IS had the ability to launch cyber attacks to get that information, Haney answered: “Well, I think you have seen our outfits, like IS and ISIL, various other organizations, as you look at the list of different cyber activities that have occurred. And clearly in the case of that group, being able to use it to recruit, use cyber to threaten and those kind of things —- so we see more and more sophistication associated with that. “This is something that we look at very, very closely. U.S. Cyber Command as well as our interagency team are working this piece. And, quite frankly, it is looked at on a day-to-day basis. “ I would just say, you know, they were — wherever they got that information, it didn’t come from Department of Defense’s networks, quite frankly. It’s unfortunate. And, quite frankly, the safety and welfare of the joint military forces and particularly the people I lead is very important, going forward. “So we do have a campaign where we practice and train on operational security, but not just with the members, but also alert the families, in terms of this business of using social media.” NBC News reports that IS may have gotten the information from public websites, not through cyber attacks. Pentagon public affairs websites reportedly posted the names and photos of 66 of the people on the list with job descriptions like “bomb squadron commander.” ","Religious"

"Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, views on September 11-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/falwell-robertson-wtc/"," There are several different versions of the eRumor.  Some say that in an Interview on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club telecast, Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell seemed to be resting the blame for the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on 9/11/01 on their political and moral enemies rather than the terrorists themselves.  Others simply repeat their remarks that gays, abortionists, the ACLU, and the People For the American Way should share in the blame for a spiritual vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place. "," According to the CBN website, the Interview took place on Thursday, September 13 (Some versions of the eRumor say it was Wednesday). Both men spoke harshly of the terrorists and clearly blamed them for the attacks. During a discussion about whether this crisis might bring revival to America, Jerry Falwell said God may have allowed what the nation deserved because of moral decay and said Americans should have an attitude of repentance before God and asking for God’s protection.  He specifically listed the ACLU, abortionists, feminists, gays, and the People For the American way as sharing in the blame.  Pat Robertson responded with agreement. APOLOGY The was national publicity over the Robertson-Falwell interview and strong reaction from representatives of some of the groups that Falwell named. On 9/14/01, Falwell issued an apology for his comments and said he believes that the terrorists alone were responsible for the attacks.  He reiterated, however, that theologically he believes that groups that have worked to secularize America have helped remove the nation from its spiritual foundations. Pat Robertson, on his website, distanced himself from the comments that he had agreed with at the time they were made.  He said that during the interview, Falwell suddenly made a “…political statement of blame directed at certain segments of the population that was severe and harsh in tone, and, frankly, not fully understood by the three hosts of The 700 Club who were watching Rev. Falwell on a monitor.”  Robertson said he considered the comments “totally inappropriate” and that critics had taken the words out of context. THE TRANSCRIPT Here are their comments in context: Pat Robertson began the interview asking Falwell what his response has been to the terrorist attacks.  Falwell said there had been a massive prayer gathering of members of his congregation along with students from Liberty University.  He told the TV audience that they had humbled themselves before God, prayed for President Bush and his advisers and for the victims of the attacks. Falwell then likened the attacks to Pearl Harbor and that at that time, Hitler wanted to destroy the Jews and conquer the world.  Now, “Islamic fundamentalists, radical terrorists, Middle-Eastern monsters” want to destroy Israel and conquer the world. The two men then talked about religious revival and whether the events of September 11 might spark spiritual renewal in America. Then Falwell said, “What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.” Robertson replied,  “Well, Jerry, that’s my feeling. I think we’ve just seen the antechamber to terror, we haven’t begun to see what they can do to the major population.” Falwell said, “The ACLU has got to take a lot of blame for this. And I know I’ll hear from them for this, but throwing God…successfully with the help of the federal court system…throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools, the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad…I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who try to secularize America…I point the finger in their face and say you helped this happen.” Robertson said, “I totally concur, and the problem is we’ve adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government, and so we’re responsible as a free society for what the top people do, and the top people, of course, is the court system.” Falwell added, “Pat, did you notice yesterday that the ACLU and all the Christ-haters, the People for the American Way, NOW, etc., were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress, as they went out on the steps and and called out to God in prayer and sang ‘God bless America’ and said, let the ACLU be hanged. In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time, calling on God.” ","Religious"

"“The Beast,” a supercomputer in Belgium with every person on earth in it-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:57:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beastofbelgium/"," A three-story computer in Brussels, Belgium called “The Beast,” is described as being the brain-child of the European Common Market.  It is said to be “self programming” and is intended to track the buying and selling activities of every person on earth.  Additionally, the system is alleged to depend on invisible tattoos on the forehead or back of the hand of each person for identity purposes.  Ominously, the tattoo will be of a unique, personalized number composed of three entries of three digits each. "," It’s easy to see how this story would grab the attention of Christians. It’s almost as though it were tailor-made to fit with the book of Revelation. And… it was. Unlike most urban legends, we have a clear trail that leads to where the story came from. There are various printed versions of the story that date back to 1973, but the most widely circulated early account appeared in Christian Life magazine in August 1976. Three months after publishing the story, Christian Life received a letter from Christian author Joe Musser. In it, he explained that the Beast Computer of Belgium did not exist in reality, but in fantasy. Musser said that he created the scenario for a novel he wrote, titled Beyond a Pale Horse, and for a screenplay for the David Wilkerson film, The Rapture . In the letter, Musser said that for three years he had seen the story he had created being passed along as fact. The possibility for confusing fiction with fact was there from the outset. As a part of the promotion for the David Wilkerson film, some mock newspapers had been printed which had convincing-looking news stories about events that could be associated with the rapture, including the Beast Computer of Belgium. Unless one read the small print next to the copyright notice, there was nothing to indicate that it was fiction. As with other urban legends, some thoughtful evaluation of the facts would cast doubt on the story. For example, anybody who is savvy enough about computers would know that it’s not going to take a computer occupying three stories of a major building to catalog all the people on the earth. Today’s computers can handle the task in a fraction of that space – assuming there was some way to know who all the people were. Also, some versions of the story stated that the computer was self-programming, suggesting that perhaps it had a life of its own outside of the humans who programmed it. Artificial intelligence is a fascinating subject, and computers are getting smarter every day, but no computer expert that I know of is worried about whether a database program could become the Antichrist. Additionally, even if a decision were made to track all humans, it is not clear that the European Common Market would be the entity to initiate or control it. ","Religious"
"Woman who preached to Alaska Airlines passengers on doomed flight-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:57:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alaskaflight261/"," The email being circulated says that a pastor’s wife on a doomed Alaska Airlines plane addressed the passengers for 9 minutes and led them in prayer before the plane crashed.  This allegedly came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings.  The original version of the eRumor said the pastor’s wife was from Idaho.  More recent versions say it was a pastor’s wife from Washington.  Further, the email states that the pilot says there was no explanation for why the plane was able to stay aloft for those final 9 minutes. "," There is no evidence this happened.  The National Transportation Safety Board has now released the cockpit voice recordings from the flight and there is nothing like this story on them. Alaska flight 261 crashed off the coast of California on January 31, 2000.  The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner carried 88 people.  There were no survivors. Among the passengers were Joe and Linda Knight from Monroe, Washington.  They were co-pastors of The Rock Church in Monroe.  Their adult son, who is also a minister, is quoted in news reports as saying Linda was the kind of person who would probably preach to the passengers during an emergency.  It is possible that’s where the story originated. When the eRumor first started, there were several things about it that didn’t seem valid. First, the claim that the information came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings was not credible.  The tapes were in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board who keeps things like that very secure.  It would be illegal for anyone to release that kind of information before the NTSB does. Second, we talked with several pilots who fly the MD-80 and they all agreed that the cockpit voice recorder does not record what is said in the passenger cabin over the P.A. system.  It records the cockpit crew and radio conversations. Third, it is not credible that any passenger would have been able to spend 9 minutes talking over the P.A. system to fellow passengers.  According to published news reports, the first time the plane reported trouble to air traffic controllers was at 4:10pm.  The last transmission from the plane was at 4:17pm and it disappeared from radar at 4:21pm.  That meant there were about 11 minutes from the beginning of the emergency to the crash.  For Linda Knight to have addressed the passengers for 9 minutes, she would have been given the microphone within 2 minutes of when the crew first reported a problem.  If anything would have been communicated to the passengers during that time, it would have been from the crew and if they felt a crash was imminent, they would have been talking about emergency procedures, not letting a passenger address the other passengers. Finally, there is good explanation how the plane stayed in the air.  The pilots were able to struggle to stabilize the plane and had reported to controllers that they thought they could make it to Los Angeles International Airport.  It is believed that there was catastrophic failure that led to the plane’s final plunge into the ocean.  So this story felt, acted, and tasted like a rumor from the beginning.

It’s in the form of an appeal from the American Family Association urging citizens to complain to the FCC and to members of congress. "," An Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision about a particular occurrence of the F-word on a telecast has sparked controversy, but it isn’t accurate to say that the FCC has approved blanket use of the F-word on radio and television. On April 1, 2013 the FCC released a public notice requesting comments regarding their indecency policies. Click for statement. Currently, the FCC has a guideline posted on their website stressing that content is important to whether or not they will pursue a broadcaster for violations.  The guideline said, “It is a violation of federal law to air obscene programming at any time. It is also a violation of federal law to air indecent programming or profane language during certain hours. Congress has given the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the responsibility for administratively enforcing these laws. The FCC may revoke a station license, impose a monetary forfeiture or issue a warning if a station airs obscene, indecent or profane material.” It was during the Golden Globes Awards telecast on January 19, 2003 that Bono of the band U2 told the audience “this is really, really, f___ing brilliant”” The FCC said the comment was also reported as “this is f___ing great.” There were numerous complaints. The FCC issued a ruling that said Bono used the word as an adjective and not to describe sexual or excretory organs or activities, which is the FCC’s key test for broadcast indecency. In it’s ruling, the FCC said that such “fleeting and isolated remarks of this nature do not warrant Commission action.” Still, critics are saying that even the use of the F-word as an adjective has not been that common on broadcasts, primarily because of fear of running afoul of the FCC and they fear this will mark a change. The FCC responds to complaints of viewers and listeners and rulings regarding objectionable words and scenes have been made before, especially about radio programs. An FCC decision is not the only one affecting what is broadcast. There are also local or state laws that are a part of the picture as well as the decisions and standards of broadcast organizations…not to mention the public.

"," This email is a hoax. 1.  It talks about the fact that the name, “Bill Gates III” adds up to “666” in ASCII code.  Let’s start there.  (This may get a little complex).  Every letter, number, and symbol on a computer has a corresponding numerical ASCII code.  It’s not only the way a computer communicates behind the scenes, but a standardized way that computers can speak the same language to each another.  Also, each letter or number on the keyboard has two different versions of the ASCII code, one called a decimal code and one called a hexadecimal equivalent.  For a capital “A”, for example, the ASCII decimal is 65 and the hexadecimal equivalent is 41.  In the email, all the ASCII codes for “Bill Gates” are correct if you use the decimal ASCII codes for capital letters.  When it comes to “III”, however, nothing adds up.  The email claims that the ASCII code for each of characters in “III” is 1, but that is not the case.  If you use lower case “L” for the “III”, the decimal ASCII code is 108.  If you use upper case “i”, the decimal code is 73.  If you use the number “1”, the decimal code is 49.  There isn’t any instance in the ASCII code in which any of the visible letters or numerals that would be used for “III” has a decimal or hexadecimal number that equates to “1.” 2.  The writer of the email tries to emphasize the point by saying that if you go to Windows 95 or MS-DOS, you’ll get the same result.  That’s meaningless because the ASCII code is a standardized one and is the same on each computer that uses it.  There is not one ASCII code for Windows 95, then another for Windows 98, then another for the various version of MS-DOS. 3.  Regarding THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS, there is nothing sinister about it and it has nothing to do with Bill Gates or Microsoft controlling any other computers, much more the U.S. nuclear arsenal.  The HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is what’s known among computer buffs as an “Easter Egg.”  Software programmers routinely include fun stuff in their programs that is hidden from normal view.  That’s why they’re called “Easter Eggs,” because they are hidden and you have to find them.  One website that catalogs Easter Eggs has accumulated a list of nearly four thousand of them in thousands of different software programs.  Some of them are humorous pictures.  Others are clever games.  Many Easter Eggs display a list of all of the names of programmers who created the program.  THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is a game of sorts that the programmers included in Microsoft Excel 95.  It results in your finding a list of the creators as well as some pictures.

The proposed construction of a mosque in Seville, Spain, in 2008 carried a great deal of cultural significance. It had been 750 years since the city’s last mosque had been converted into a Christian church in 1248. Seville residents pushed back on the mosque’s proposed construction, and the plant a pig movement was born. By November 2010, construction of the mosque still wasn’t underway when citizens launched “Operation Gorrino,” as it was dubbed, and staged a funeral before burying a pig on land the city had committed to the mosque, MinutoDigital reports . A video of the protest showed about “15 people young people” burying a pig on the site. In the end, the mosque was never constructed there, according to IslamicFinder.com . However, reports indicate that the project was doomed by lack of funding rather than the so-called Muslim Kryptonite. Another high-profile instance of the plant a pig movement cropped up in Switzerland in 2011. Police in Solothum Canton found pig body parts and pig blood buried on the site of a mosque after an anonymous tip, CNN reports . A Central Islamic Council spokesperson said the stunt had “crossed the line” and mirrored recent “Islamophobia” in the region. But the plant a pig movement didn’t prompt the partitioners to stop using the mosque. “We can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground, so we do not fear from this side anything,” the Central Islamic spokesperson said.

"NASA computers found the “missing day” of the Bible story about Joshua-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/joshuaday/"," An email says that NASA (The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has stumbled across some computer generated evidence that the Bible is true.  A man named Harold Hill, a NASA consultant and president of the Curtis engine company, describes how NASA computers were looking back in time when they issued an alert that something was wrong.  There seemed to be a day missing from the calculations.  The scientists puzzled over this a long time until someone in their midst reflected that in the Bible, there’s a story about the day the sun stood still for the Hebrew leader Joshua.  This solves the puzzle, almost.  According to the computer, not an entire day was lost, but 23 hours and 20 minutes.  Now there’s a new problem.  What about the other 40 minutes?  That’s when the same employee remembers that there is another story in the Bible about a day when the sun moved backwards 10 degrees which, according to the employee, is an arc of 40 minutes…so the entire question of the missing day is solved! "," Except for the reference to the astronauts, this version of ‘the Missing Day’ story has been around for nearly 30 years.  Harold Hill was a real person and he was the president of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore, Maryland. He had converted to Christianity as an adult and became a popular speaker among Christian groups, because he was a successful businessman, claimed to be a consultant to NASA, and did presentations on science and the Bible.  One of his most popular presentations was the story of the Missing Day. Harold Hill apparently told the story without much notice until October 1969, when a columnist for a small American newspaper was told about one of his speeches and was given some notes about the Missing Day.  She was so intrigued, that she wrote it up and it was published. The columnist’s name was Mary Kathryn Bryan and her column appeared in the Spencer Evening World in Spencer, Indiana. According to the newspaper, the results of that particular column were ‘simply unbelievable’.  They started receiving requests from all over the world for reprints of the article, and finally stopped counting when the number of inquiries passed 1,500. The total number of cards, letters and telephone calls is now in the thousands. From that article, the Missing Day story found its way into untold numbers of magazines, newspapers, gospel tracts, books and now emails.  Harold Hill himself included it in a Christian book which he wrote. The story has several problems, however. One problem is that apart from Harold Hill, there is no known source for the NASA story.  For many years, whenever anyone wrote to him about it, he sent a form letter which said he had misplaced the source of the information, but would send everybody a copy when he found it.  The source never materialized. In his subsequent book, Hill dismissed all skepticism about the story and said that no substantiation was needed.  His attitude was that if people believed it and it drew them to spiritual things, it was justified. Another problem is that NASA has denied that Harold Hill was ever one of its consultants.  James S. Lacy, from the Office of Public Relations for NASA, wrote in a letter to a journalist that the only trace they could find of a Harold Hill having any connection with NASA was a person who was involved in contracting for the operations and maintenance of some diesel engine operations. Further, according to a letter I have from the NASA Public Affairs office in Washington, ‘There is no truth to the recurring story that NASA uncovered a lost day in the movement of the Earth.’ It is interesting to note that an attempt to explain Joshua’s long day from a scientific standpoint was published many years before Harold Hill’s NASA story. In the 1930s, Dr Harry Rimmer wrote a book called ‘The Harmony of Science and Scripture’, in which he drew from an 1890 book by Yale professor C.A. Totten. Using popular biblical chronologies of the time, Totten concluded that the world was created 4,000 years before the birth of Christ, on Sunday, September 22, 4000BC. However, he said that the calendar calculations showed that September 22 was actually a Monday, and not a Sunday, and that the error was probably because of Joshua’s missing day. Totten also makes reference to the Hezekiah story in 2 Kings and argues that this accounts for another missing 20 minutes or so. Totten’s calculations sound suspiciously familiar to the NASA story. The bottom line seems to be that there is a lot still missing about ‘the Missing Day’. Updated 7/24/05.

Sudanese law states that Muslim women are only permitted to marry Muslim men. Ibrahim’s father was a Muslim, so the authorities considered her to be a Muslim as well, therefore would not recognize her marriage to a Christian.

History of this eRumor The 2001 eRumor appeared to be a new, Internet version of a older rumor we investigated in 1986 when an article in a magazine in the state of Illinois in the United States claimed such a film was being proposed. The movie project was authentic, but never got off the ground. A rumor about the movie was circulated far and wide, however, and multitudes of letters were received by an Illinois state agency which, for some reason, became the focus of the protest. The movie never had anything to do with Illinois but had merely been mentioned in a publication from Illinois. The rumor as it is appeared on the Net was very weak, lacking specific information as to who was producing the movie or where anyone could write to effectively protest it. to who was producing the movie or where anyone could write to effectively protest it. Additionally, the encouragement to add a name to the list and forward the email is useless. Who is going to send the final version and to whom? The stage play has created controversy wherever it was presented. It featured a lead character with the name Joshua, which is a variation of the name Jesus. In the play, Joshua is a young gay man who fled form his home town of Corpus Christi, Texas, because of persecution over being homosexual. He returns, assembles a group of disciples, with whom he has sex, faces violent opposition, is betrayed by his friend Judas, and is crucified. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) there was a film that was released in 1997 by the title of “Corpus Christi” but it was not based on the McNally stage play but it was, in fact, a French documentary on Jesus that featured interviews of scientists, theologians and archeologists.

"," TruthOrFiction.com has found no evidence that   Julia Gillard made such a comment.  This appears to be an old   eRumor that has risen from the ashes and made current by changing the   political figure who was alleged to made such a comment. The origin of this eRumor stems back to 2006 when Australian Finance Minister Peter   Costello said in a speech at the Sydney Institute, “There is one law we are   all expected to abide by. It is the law enacted by the Parliament under   the Australian Constitution. If you can’t accept that then you don’t   accept the fundamentals of what Australia is and what it stands for.” Costello   suggested that if someone wanted to live under Sharia law [law derived   from the Koran], Saudia Arabia and Iran should be considered.

"ABC bleeps “Jesus” from the delayed broadcast of a TV Show-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abc-jesus/"," It is alleged that ABC edited out the use of the name “Jesus” in a release of the morning talk show THE VIEW. The eRumor says that Joy Behar, one of the hosts of the  show issued a heart-felt “Thank you Jesus” for the  success of her weight-loss campaign. Her reference to Jesus was broadcast during the live show, but on the delayed West Coast release of the program, it was allegedly blocked. "," The eRumor circulated in several forms. One of them (below) is a letter from the Rev. Jerry Falwell.  Another is a WorldNews.com article based on a report from the Media Research Center. The story is true. It happened to the May 23, 2002 broadcast of THE VIEW, which is also hosted by Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, and Lisa Ling. The protest against ABC is by Christians who interpreted the incident as being anti-religious or anti-Christian.  ABC told CNN, however, that the name of Jesus came up in a humorous way and that the decision to bleep it was not meant to be one of disrespect to Jesus or to Christians but to be sensitive to those who might have been offended with the humorous us of it.  ABC said that the name Jesus can be used in a respectful way, but the network prohibits it from being used in exclamations. The eRumor gives the impression that Joy Behar’s comment was one of saying thanks to Jesus for her weight loss, but the script shows that it was more flippant than that.  Behar had been dieting and keeping track of her progress on the air.  During the May 23 program, Meredith Vieira made a comment about the fact that Behar’s ordeal of daily weigh-ins was now ended.  Behar’s joyful acknowledgement appears to over the end of the diet. TruthOrFiction.com viewed a video of the original broadcast.  Here is the transcript: Meredith Vieira: “So yesterday, yesterday if you saw this show, you know it was the last day of the weigh-in, the scale is gone.” Joy Behar: “Yes, and thank you, thank you, Jesus, is all I have to say! Goodbye to that damn scale and this whole diet. I’m sick of it!” The comment comes across as humorous gratitude for the end of the diet. The Falwell letter asks what would have happened if the name of Jesus had been used in vain instead of praise.  Would it have been taken out?  ABC says that’s what happened…a use of the name of Jesus in a way other than praise and that’s why it was taken out. Critics, however, say it is “political correctness run amok.”  Baher herself objected to the comment being taken out. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  It was not a heart-felt expression of praise to Jesus but was probably not meant to be disrespectful either.

"Religious significance of George Washington and the Washington memorial-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/washmonument/"," The eRumor describes some of the inscriptions and design of the Washington Monument in Washington D.C. in light of controversy over references to God in government settings. "," This one’s got many statements in it, so let’s take them one by one. The words “Laus Deo” on the cap of the monument- Truth! There is an aluminum point crowning the apex of the monument. There are four sides, each facing a point of the compass.  According to the National Park Service, the north side lists the members of the joint commission that was in charge of the Washington monument project.  The west side lists the dates of the laying of the cornerstone, the first stone laid at the height of 152 fee, and the the setting of the capstone. The south side lists the names of chief engineer, the architect, and some of the workmen.  The east side simply has the words “Laus Deo” which is translated as “Praise be to God.” Washington DC was laid out to be in the design of a cross- Fiction! It seems to be in the form of a cross, but there’s no evidence that was the intent of the designer, architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant.  If one sees the layout of White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Capitol, and The Lincoln Memorial as the intended cross, it was not in the mind of Charles L’Enfant because he proposed the original design in 1791, which was long before it was decided that the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials would be built and where (1911 and 1934). On the 12th Landing is a prayer offered by the City of Baltimore- Truth! There is a memorial stone in the wall at the 140-foot level with the following blessing: “May heaven to this union continue its beneficence.  May brotherly affection with union be perpetual. May the free constitution which is the work of our ancestors be sacredly maintained and its administration be stamped with wisdom and virtue.” On the 20th landing is a memorial presented by some Chinese Christians- Truth! It is from Christians from the port city of Ningpo, Chekiang Province, Mainland China and is a eulogy to George Washington. On the 24th landing a presentation made by Sunday School children from New York and Philadelphia quoting Proverbs 10:7, Luke 18:16 and Proverbs 22:6.- Truth! The memorial says it is presented by the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York and from the Sabbath School children of the Methodist Episcopal church in Philadelphia.  It then says “A preached Gospel” and “A free press” then closes with “Washington, we revere his memory.” The inscriptions include the Bible reference Proverbs 10:7. There is also an open bible on the monument that includes Luke 18:16 where Jesus said “Suffer the little children to come unto me” and Proverbs 22:6, which says “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” When the cornerstone was laid, one of the items in it was a Bible-Truth! Several dozen items were placed into the monument at the laying of the cornerstone including, according to the National Park Service, a copy of the Bible presented by The Bible Society. Washington’s Prayer for America- Truth! But altered. This is an interesting one. This “prayer of Washington” is widely circulated and reflects his true wishes about the United States because the bulk of it comes from his own words. There is a certain lack of integrity with the prayer, however, in that he never really formally prayed it in the way that is circulated. Someone along the way decided to create the prayer from one of Washington’s letters and package it in the fabricator’s own religious cultural language. The original words from Washington are from the closing paragraph of a letter to the governors of the 13 states on the occasion of his retirement from command of the Continental Army and public life.  We consulted John C. Fitzpatrick’s collection of the writings of George Washington that are available through the University of Virginia Library and which includes the text of the letter. In the letter, Washington said that he wanted the governors to convey his words to their legislatures and that he hoped it would be regarded as coming from someone who always wished to be useful to his country and who in the shade of retirement would not fail to “implore divine benediction upon it.” Then his final paragraph contains the words of his benediction: I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preside, in his holy protection, that he would incline the hearts of the Citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to Government, to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow Citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have served in the Field, and finally, that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all, to do Justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that Charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the Characteristicks of the Divine Author of our blessed Religion, and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy Nation. The prayer that is circulated, however, adds a formal salutation and prayer ending, changes it to King James English (used for formal prayers among many Christian groups), changes some of the wording, and leaves out words from the original.   A blessing that was written to the governors of the states about their states and their soldiers was changed to be a general prayer about the country. We even found one reference that claimed the prayer was prayed by George Washington during battle at Valley Forge. Last updated 12/5/03 ","Religious"

"," There have been many printed       references to this story and connected it to the great American band       leader, Tommy Dorsey. But the classic gospel song “Precious Lord Take My Hand”       was actually written by a different man with the same name. The trombonist and band leader named Tommy Dorsey was born in 1905       and died in 1956. Tommy Dorsey the composer of “Precious Lord Take My Hand”       was a jazz pianist and composer was born in 1899 and died in 1993. He is regarded by many as the father of gospel music. After a successful career as a blues musician, he switched to gospel       music. For more than 40 years, he was the choir director Chicago’s Pilgrim       Baptist Church. The actual story of the tragic death of his wife is a bit different       from the eRumor. In an account in his own words written for Guideposts Magazine,       Dorsey said he was actually scheduled to be in St. Louis to sing for       a revival. He had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of       pregnancy When he left his home to head for St. Louis, he realized that he had       forgotten his music case, so he returned to get it and found his       wife sleeping. He stood next to her and felt that something was telling him to stay       home. He decided to leave and headed back to his car for the drive to the       meetings. The next night at the revival and after he had finished singing, a       telegram was handed to him that said his wife had just died. He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby       boy before she died. Before the night was over, the baby had died as well. Dorsey went through a difficult period after that. He said he wanted to give up serving the Lord and go back to jazz. One of the thoughts that haunted him was whether his reluctance to       leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he       had been disobedient by ignoring it. He vowed that he would never be insensitive to such a leading again. It was during a subsequent visit to a friend that he sat down at a       piano and found himself at peace and a melody being played. That became the song “Precious Lord Take My Hand.” Dorsey wrote, “ As the Lord gave me       these words and melody, He also healed my spirit. I learned that       when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from God,       this is when He is closest, and when we are most open to His       restoring power. And so I go on living for God willingly and       joyfully, until that day comes when He will take me and gently lead       me home.” ","Religious"

But Inaccurate! Above the east entrance to the Supreme Court building (which is the back entrance, not the front entrance), Moses is one of three Eastern law givers along with Confucius and Solon. Although he’s in the middle, Confucius and Salon are facing the front as well, not facing Moses. There are figures on each side of the three men facing them. The tablets in the sculpture are blank and although inspired by the Ten Commandments, the office of the curator of the U.S. Supreme Court says they have come to symbolically represent the “tablets of the law.” The artist, Herman MacNeil, said “The ‘Eastern Pediment’ of the Supreme Court Building suggests…the treatment of such fundamental laws and precepts as are derived from the East. Moses, Confucius and Solon.” As you enter the Supreme Court courtroom, the two huge oak doors have the Ten Commandments engraved on each lower portion of each door- Unproven! As stated above, the tablets are used in the Supreme Court building as symbolic representations of law. In some places they also represent not the Ten Commandments but the first ten amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. As you sit inside the courtroom, you can see the wall, right above where the Supreme Court judges sit, a display of the Ten Commandments!- Fiction! The wall that is described includes a frieze that, among other things, has two male figures who represent the Majesty of Law and the Power of Government. Between the two male figures is a tablet with the numbers 1 through 10 in Roman numerals. According to the artist, Adolph A. Weinman, these represent the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution. There are Bible verses etched in stone all over the Federal Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C. – Truth! It is true that there are versus from the Bible on various buildings and monuments in Washington D.C. James Madison, the fourth president, known as “The Father of Our Constitution” made the following statement “We have staked the whole of all our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.”- Unproven! We’ve not been able to find documentation for this. Patrick Henry, that patriot and Founding Father of our country said, “It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians, not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ” – Unproven!

Thomas Jefferson worried that the Courts would overstep their authority and instead of interpreting the law would begin making law….an oligarchy….the rule of few over many- Truth! One of Jefferson’s biographers, Dumas Malone, wrote of Jefferson’s views on the dangers of judicial activism. In Volume 6 of his series Jefferson and His Time: The Sage of Monticello, he cites a letter that Jefferson wrote to a William Charles Jarvis of Massachusetts. Jefferson was responding to something the man had sent him to read and which Jefferson felt had included the erroneous doctrine that Judges were the ultimate arbiters in all constitutional matters.  Jefferson says that he knows of “no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves” and that the power did not belong to a judicial oligarchy. The very first Supreme Court Justice, John Jay, said, “Americans should select and prefer Christians as their rulers.”- Truth! The exact quote is “Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.” Jay wrote it in a private letter to Jedidiah Morse in 1797.

"Judge Roy Moore-10 Commandments","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/roymoore/"," The eRumor encourages       support for Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore who was ordered       by a U.S. appeals court to remove The Ten Commandments from a state       judicial building. The judge has refused to remove it. "," The story is true. Judge Moore was suspended from his post and charged with six ethics violations for refusing to remove the granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Supreme Court building by August 20, 2003. On November 13, 2004, the Alabama Court of the Judiciary expelled Moore from his position as Chief Justice. It all began in 1995 when the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Moore for his practice of opening court sessions in prayer and for a hand-carved wooden plaque of the Ten Commandments that hangs in his courtroom. They said it violates the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution. At the time, Moore was a state circuit court judge but he was later elected as the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 2001, he had a 5,280-pound granite monument of The Ten Commandments placed in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court. Moore says no taxpayer money was used to purchase or place the monument. In October of 2001, the Alabama ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed suit demanding that the granite monument be removed. A U.S. District court judge ordered Moore to remove the monument, but he refused saying that to do so would violate his oath of office because he has vowed to uphold the law, the foundation of which is The Ten Commandments. Then the case went to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ordered the August 20 removal date and threatened fines of $5,000 per day for the first week with that amount doubling each week thereafter. last updated 11/13/03 ","Religious"
"“Eternity” the story of the homeless man in Sydney, Australiawho went down in history-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stace/"," A story about Arthur Stace, a homeless alcoholic who lived in the Streets of Sydney, Australia. After a conversion to Christianity, quit drinking, and spent the rest of his life writing the word “Eternity” all over the city in yellow chalk. He is remembered in Sydney for his nearly 40-years of colorful lettering, which was designed to prompt people to think about eternity and their own mortality. "," According to multiple sources, this       story is true. Beginning in the 1930s Arthur Stace spent his early morning hours writing the word       “Eternity” in a distinctive cursive style in every       doorway, on every street, and major entrance to a public area that       he could find in Sydney. For years, the citizens of the city wondered who was writing the       “one word sermon” and why. Every once in a while, someone would claim responsibility for the       graffiti and the newspapers would print the stories. In 1956, Stace was a member of the Burton Street Baptist Church,       where he also served as the janitor and a prayer leader. One day, the pastor of the church, Rev. Lisle M. Thompson, stumbled       across Stace while he was writing his chalk message on a sidewalk       and the mystery of the “Eternity” messages all over Sydney       was solved. Stace said that after his conversion to Christianity, he heard a       sermon in which the evangelist said  “Eternity! Eternity! Oh, that this word could be emblazoned across     the streets of Sydney!” In his simple way, Stace decided to do that. There is a huge illuminated sign on the Sydney Harbour Bridge that       says “Eternity” in Trace’s distinctive handwriting, a sign       that was clearly seen by hundreds of millions of people during the       fireworks display at the end of the opening ceremonies at the Olympics       in Sidney in 2000.

"The pastor who was raised from the dead in Nigeria-God only knows!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/raisedfromthedead/"," This widely circulated       story is about Nigerian Pastor who was declared dead after an       automobile accident.  He was taken to a mortuary and prepared       for burial.  His wife, however, felt that God had promised her       that such a thing would not happen so she transported the coffin by       ambulance to a church were an evangelist was holding meetings and       with the expectation that her husband would be raised from the       dead.  His body was taken to a room in the church where he       started breathing, opened his eyes, sat up, and to the joy of the       people at the church, apparently came back from the dead. "," This is a story that doesn’t have the kind of evidence to satisfy the skeptics but is sincere enough to thrill the believers. The most commonly circulated version is an article from the website of Christian evangelist Reinhard Bonnke .  It goes into detail about the experience of Nigerian pastor Daniel Ekechukwu.  Bonnke’s organization has also released a video documentary of the incident which features interviews with many of the people involved including a doctor, the mortician, Ekechukwu’s wife and father, and several pastors who were there when he started showing signs of life again. The first question that our readers have been asking is whether there is any evidence that this is a hoax, an intentional deception on the part of the pastor, the evangelist, or any of their supporters.  From the accounts of the story, interviews with the participants, the video documentary, and even a researcher who is skeptical about the story, everybody involved is sincere in their belief about Pastor Ekechukwu’s experience.  The events happened spontaneously and without apparent planning or collusion. The key question focuses on whether Ekechukwu truly died.  After he stopped breathing while being transported from a hospital to a doctor’s office, he was seen by two doctors, who regarded him as dead, but critics say the examinations were brief and could have overlooked minimal signs of life.  One of the doctors was interviewed in the video and said that he checked both breathing and heart activity with a stethoscope and that Ekechukwu’s eyes were fixed and dilated.  He signed the paperwork to send him on to the mortuary.  The mortician is also interviewed in the video and says he regarded Ekechukwu as dead and ready for burial.  Initial versions of the eRumor said the mortician had embalmed the body.  The video carefully avoids that topic and quotes the doctor as saying the pastor was ready to be embalmed.  Leo Igwe, a Nigerian skeptic who is critical of claims of miracles says the mortician told him that he had not done anything to embalm the body.  Igwe also says that he was told by physicians that if Ekechukwu had actually been dead and without embalming, there would have been evidence of that such as abdominal bloating that is not visible in pictures of his body at the time.  The mortician did, however, tell Igwe the fascinating story that the pastor’s body was not “allowing” him to sleep at night and that he had heard a chorus of voices singing from the mortuary. Apart from the question about whether Ekechukwu actually died, his is a remarkable story.  He was regarded as dead, lay in a coffin in a small mortuary in his father’s village for two days with wooden plugs in his nostrils, his coffin was taken to a church because of his wife’s belief that he would come back to life, he woke up in the midst of people singing and praying for him, and now has the perspective of a person who has been given a second chance at life.  He also says that while he was counted as among the dead, he had an experience of being escorted by angels to both heaven and hell and being given a message to bring back to tell others.  In the video, he revisits his father’s village, the doctor who pronounced him dead, the mortician who tended to him, and sees the coffin in which he lay and some of the grave clothes he wore.

"," This story is true. Target stores informed the Salvation Army that for the first time, the Salvation Army solicitors will not be allowed in front of Target stores during the 2004 holiday season. Salvation Army bell ringers, the “Sharing is Caring” message, and the familiar red kettles for taking contributions have been a tradition in front of retail stores for a century. In a news release, Target said the decision was to avoid showing favoritism in the face of solicitation or donation requests from a large number of organizations. The Salvation Army says it’s a blow to them because Target locations produced $9 million in donations the previous year. Update! In late 2005 it was announced on the Salvation Army website that Target and the Salvation Army were partnering together on the “Target/Salvation Army Wish List” an online site to provide items for those affected by the hurricanes and other people in need. The Boston Globe looked into the 2004 red kettle campaign and found that there is a bit of a schism between retailers. Some of them, including Target and BestBuy, are banning the bell ringers both because of competing requests and because of customers who don’t like them. But others, such as Wal-Mart, Big Lots, Autozone and Books-A-Million, are welcoming the Salvation Army and the civic-minded reputation they feel accompanies it. The Salvation Army was founded in England by William Booth who felt a calling to serve the totality of those in need…spiritual, physical, and material. The Salvation Army is an international relief ministry that provides personal help, housing, family services, and disaster services in numerous parts of the world. The red kettle tradition for the Salvation Army got started in 1891 in San Francisco. The local Salvation Army captain, Joseph McFee,  had promised himself to provide a free Christmas dinner for the poor. To help pay for it, he hearkened to his memories as a sailor in England where there was what was called a “Simpson’s Pot” at a stage landing into which passersby tossed coins to support charitable causes. He got permission to put a kettle at the Oakland ferry landing…and the tradition spread from there to around the world. Updated 11/23/04 ","Religious"

"A U.S. Federal Appeals Court has ruled the Pledge of Allegianceunconstitutional -Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pledge/"," The eRumor says that the       9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has decided that because the U.S.       Pledge of Allegiance mentions God, it is unconstitutional because of       the separation of church and state.  Follow-up versions say        that the suit that brought the decision is a sham because the        atheist who filed it isn’t the only one with parental authority        over the child who was allegedly injured by the pledge and that        the child is a Christian. "," As with many legal cases, especially constitutional ones, this is a complex issue. First, the story about the Appeals Court decision is true.  On 6/26/02 the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals ruled that the pledge of allegiance in public schools was and “unconstitutional endorsement of religion” because of the phrase “under God.” The next day Circuit Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, who wrote the opinion, blocked his own ruling until all the members of the 9th circuit decide whether to reconsider the case.  They can choose to hear the case again with a three judge panel or or an eleven member panel.  U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said his department would request the eleven.  The ruling and the decision to block the ruling have no effect on the schools affected by the decision since it had not gone into effect.  The decision would affect schools in 9 western states. The decision prompted a national outcry. At the heart of the controversy is Michael Newdow, a California emergency room physician with a law degree who has initiated several court actions acting as his own attorney.  In this case, he sued the El Grove, California school district, challenging the constitutionality of teachers being required to lead the students in the Pledge of Allegiance since it included the phrase “under God.”  The school district asked a judge to dismiss the complaint, which he did.  Newdow appealed to the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals.  In his appeal, Newdow said that his 8-year-old daughter is injured when she is compelled to watch and listen as the teacher leads her classmates in the pledge. Shortly after the appeals court ruling, however, new facts started emerging about Newdow and his daughter that, at the very least, brought criticism of Newdow and, at the very most, prompted some legal experts to say that he might not have a case. The mother of Newdow’s child is Sandra Banning, also of the Sacramento area.  Several articles including one from the Associated Press on July 11, 2002, quoted Banning as saying that she and Newdow have never been married, that she has full custody of their daughter, that both she and the daughter are Christians who attend church regularly, and that the daughter is not only not injured by reciting the pledge, but enjoys doing it. The AP article quotes Rory Little, a Hastings College of the Law professor who follows the 9th Circuit, as saying that the case could only be heard if there was an injured party and without that, there is no case.  There is also some question about the viability of his case if he does not have any custody of his daughter. Newdow is fighting the custody agreement in court. He has also filed an appeal to another court action of his that was dismissed.  That one was filed against President Bush, objecting to a prayer by Bill Graham at his inauguration. ","Religious"

"The Mondex chip for the right hand and forehead-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mondex/"," This eRumor comes in various forms including a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. It describes new technology that can use tiny electronic chips to identify the person who has the chip and that it could be part of a future cashless society in which the chip would be used for financial exchanges instead of money. The eRumor also claims that the chip can be implanted into people’s bodies and that the two best places for it ware the right hand or the head.  The story hearkens to a Biblical passage in the book of Revelation that describes “The Mark of the Beast,” a system in which buying and selling can take place only with the approval of a world ruler who requires his mark to be on the right hand or forehead of every living person. "," This issue is the result of concern over small electronic chips being used in the marketplace that store bits of information on them that can be identified by using a special device that can detect and read them. An example is the “Speedpass” device that is used by Exxon and Mobil, among others, as a convenient way to make purchases.  The Speedpass is a small cylinder you can put on your key chain. When you buy gas, just wave the Speedpass in front of the pump and the gas will be automatically charged to your account.  Other retailers have experimented with Speedpass as a way of taking payment. These gizmos are known as RFID (radio frequency identification devices).  They are very small, can store information, and don’t need batteries.  When one of them comes within range of another device that can read their information, the radio transmission of the reader energizes the RFID chip so that the exchange of information can take place.  Because the chips are small and relatively inexpensive, some companies have begun using them for inventory control and as a substitute for bar codes. There is some controversy over that and demands that if the chips are used on retail items, such as clothing, that they be deactivated when sold.  The typical distance between the chips and their readers is a few inches. The PowerPoint presentation presents everything as being under the umbrella of “Mondex,” which is actually just a part of the picture, and the story focuses on so called “smart cards,” a credit card looking card that has actual cash amounts programmed into it. There is interest on the part of companies like MasterCard to see the smart card become popular but so far it is not clear how successful that is going to be. The device being described in the PowerPoint presentation that is circulating on the Internet  is the VeriChip from Applied Digital Technology which promoted it as “miniaturized, implantable, identification technology.”  It is a microchip encased in glass and is very tiny…about the size of the grain of rice.  When in the presence of a VeriChip reader, the information on the VeriChip can be retrieved.  One of the major purposes of the VeriChip would be to provide hospitals and medical teams any important information about yourself in an emergency.  The chip could tell them about your medical condition, any wishes you have regarding medical treatment, and other identifying information in case you are unconscious.  Another application is to identify children in case of kidnapping. The eRumor claims that a lot of money was spent to determine that the two best places for placement of the chip on the body are the right hand and the head.  All the VeriChip literature states, however, that the chip is to be placed in a fleshy area such as behind the upper arm.  We’ve not found any evidence that research suggested the right hand or the head. The eRumor claims that chips implanted into humans would be permanent and that there would be no way to get them out since any surgery designed to remove them would cause them to explode and contaminate their host.  One report claims that the attempted removal of the chip and the resulting explosion would cause radiation to enter the host’s body because of the chip’s lithium battery being destroyed. We have not been able to find any substantiation of that.  The VeriChip, for example, does not have a battery and is predicted to last for about 20 years after which it could easily be replaced. While the thought of having implanted chips seems to provide a lot of good things such as information for medical emergencies, tracking missing persons, and making purchases simpler, there are a lot of concerns to be overcome.  One is security.  How secure would your chip be from people you don’t want reading it? Plus, the conspiracy theorists do have a point:  Systems that have been enacted by governments for one purpose could be used for other, less honorable purposes. Does all of this have Biblical significance.  It could if governments decided to adopt the technology and make it mandatory.  At present, it’s commercial and voluntary.  But it’s always good to be reminded that a “Mark of the Beast” type system isn’t dependent on technology and could be implemented using something as simple as tattoos.

"," Mel Gibson has a passion for “The Passion.” It’s a $25 million movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Christ as well as his resurrection as described in the books of the Bible known as The Gospels. Opposition to the film, however, has not been only because it’s about Jesus. Religious themes including films based on the life of Jesus have come out of Hollywood before. Most of the controversy over the film has been based on concerns of critics who say it is anti-Semitic and is based on some of the unique perspectives of the traditionalist views of Gibson’s brand of Catholicism. Gibson says he has no agenda for the film except to be as faithful to the Gospel accounts as possible and that includes the role of some of the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ time who called for his execution. During his interview with Bill O’Reilly, Gibson said the film was not meant to offend Jews. Some Jews fear a backlash from the graphic portrayal of the First Century leaders. Supporters of the film say it’s not anti-Semitic because it doesn’t dismiss Jews collectively, but only the mentality of the leaders who were threatened by Jesus and wanted him killed. The positive characters in the film are also Jews including Jesus himself. A lot of the controversy over the film was launched in March, 2003, by an article published in the New York Times magazine written by free-lancer Christopher Noxon. He was the one referred to in the O’Reilly interview as writing a “hit piece.” In the article, he examines Gibson’s Catholicism and calls it “splinter group of conspiracy-minded Catholics, mystics, monarchists and disaffected conservatives.” The article also talks about Mel Gibson’s 84-year-old father, Hutton Gibson, who has been a prolific author on religious themes including his opposition to changes in the Catholic church since Vatican II in the 1960’s. Noxon says the elder Gibson told him in an interview that the Holocaust didn’t really happen although he concedes that he doesn’t know that those views are shared by Mel Gibson.

(Pictured: Purpose Driven Life book cover). Smith, a 26-year-old waitress, mother and student said she calmly talked to Nichols, turning from hostage to confidant as they discussed God, family and pancakes, along with the massive manhunt going on outside her apartment. (Pictured: Ashley Smith, 26, of Atlanta recounts her hostage experience with murder suspect Brian Nichols during an interview in Atlanta Sunday – AP/Atlanta Journal Constitution, Curtis Compton). “I believe God brought him to my door,” Smith said just hours after her 911 call ended a manhunt for Nichols, who is accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth. Smith said Nichols, 33, took her hostage in the parking lot outside her apartment when she returned from a store about 2 a.m. “He said, ‘I’m not going to hurt you if you just do what I say,’ ” she said. ” ‘I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt anybody else.’ “She said Nichols tied her up with masking tape, a curtain and extension cord and told her to sit in the bathroom while he took a shower. “I thought he was going to strangle me,” she said. Though her ordeal began with Nichols sticking a gun in her side and tying her up, it ended with the weapons on the floor, as he let her go to see her young daughter. After hours of talking about the killings, their families and God, Smith said Nichols just wanted to be normal. “I honestly think when I looked at him that he didn’t want to do it anymore,” Smith said in a statement televised on CNN. If he did not give up, she told him, “lots more people are probably going to get hurt, and you’re probably going to die.” During the night, Smith had gradually earned his trust and the two were able to relate about family matters. “I told him I was supposed to see my little girl the next morning at 10,” Smith said. “I asked him if I could go and he said no.” The situation also stirred emotion in the young mother. Choking back tears, she said she told Nichols that her husband died four years ago and that if he hurt her, her daughter would not have a mother or father. Eventually he untied her, and some of the fear lessened as they talked. Nichols told Smith he felt like “he was already dead,” but Smith encouraged him to consider the fact that he was still alive a “miracle.” “You’re here in my apartment for some reason,” she told him, saying he might be destined to be caught and to spread the word of God to fellow prisoners. Smith called 911 after she was freed, and police quickly surrounded her suburban apartment complex. When authorities arrived at the scene, Nichols gave up peacefully, waving a white towel in surrender, after Smith had convinced him to give up. Nichols allegedly overpowered a courthouse deputy who was escorting him to his rape trial Friday and took the deputy’s gun, then entered the courtroom where his trial was being held and killed the presiding judge and court stenographer. He also is accused of killing a deputy who tried to stop him outside the courthouse and a federal agent during his flight from authorities. Since his surrender and arrest, Nichols went before a judge on Tuesday, and was told that he now faces murder charges for the crime spree that left an Atlanta judge and three others dead. He remained calm and only spoke once in the court as the judge asked him if he had any questions. “Not at this time,” said Nichols. He had been in federal custody since his arrest on a federal firearms charge. But officials announced Monday that the charge had been dropped so he could be handed over to Fulton County authorities, who will likely be the first to prosecute him. Nineteen officers accompanied Nichols inside the cinderblock jail room on Tuesday at Fulton County Jail, as he went before the judge, his hands and ankles shackled as he was informed that authorities plan to charge him with murder. He faces federal and state charges in the deaths of a judge, a court reporter, a deputy and a federal agent. Prosecutors will likely decide within 30 days what new charges to file, said Fulton County district attorney’s spokesman Erik Friedly. Nichols was being retried for rape and other charges when he escaped on Friday. That case was declared a mistrial Monday at the request of Nichols’ attorney, Friedly said. Barry Hazen, Nichols’ attorney on the rape charge, has said continuing with that earlier case would be a waste of time and tax dollars. “He’s facing four homicide charges that could carry the death penalty. In the best-case scenario, he’s in jail for life. What’s the point?” Hazen said Sunday.

"Christian Charity World Vision to Hire Employees in Same Sex Marriages-Truth! But Later Reversed!","2015-03-17 20:40:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/world-vision-same-sex-policy/"," The Internet is abuzz with rumors that the largest Christian charity, World Vision, has announced a policy change that they will begin to hire employees who are in same sex marriages. "," Updated 03/26/14: Christianity Today Magazine reported that World Vision reversed their decision to hire employees in same sex marriages after “‘a number’ of child sponsors canceled their sponsorship in the past 48 hours in protest of the change to World Vision’s conduct policy.” World Vision made an announcement on Monday, according to a March 24, 2014 article by Christianity Today that said, “World Vision’s American branch will no longer require its more than 1,100 employees to restrict their sexual activity to marriage between one man and one woman.” The article went on to say that abstinence “outside of marriage remains a rule. But a policy change announced Monday [March 24] will now permit gay Christians in legal same-sex marriages to be employed at one of America’s largest Christian charities.” Richard Stearns (shown in photo), president of World Vision, told  Christianity Today  “that the ‘very narrow policy change’ should be viewed by others as ‘symbolic not of compromise but of [Christian] unity.'”  Stearns added that he “hopes it will inspire unity elsewhere among Christians.” Many Evangelical Christians leaders were shocked by this policy announcement, according to a March 25, 2014 article by World Net Daily. The article said that the president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Franklin Graham told reportes that he was “shocked today to hear of World Vision’s decision to hire employees in same-sex marriages.”   Graham went on to say that the “Bible is clear that marriage is between a man and a woman. My dear friend, Bob Pierce, the founder of World Vision and Samaritan’s Purse, would be heartbroken. He was an evangelist who believed in the inspired Word of God”   Graham added “that World Vision maintains that its decision  ‘is based on unifying the church – which I find offensive – as if supporting sin and sinful behavior can unite the church.’” On hearing this news, Tim Wildmon of the American Family Association (AFA) released a statement for Christians to stop financially supporting World Vision.   Wildmon recorded the video in the example of the eRumor below.

"Untimely Deaths of Famous People Who Mocked God – Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:39:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/untimely-deaths/"," A forwarded email with examples of untimely deaths of people who mocked God. The email quotes Galatians 6:7 and lists a group of people who all mocked God and died.  The first example is of former Beatle John Lennon who said that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.   Also included in the list are Marilyn Monroe, a rock singer who sang that he was on a “Highway to Hell”,  a Brazilian president elect, a Brazilian singer and the man who built the RMS Titanic. "," This eRumor suggests that God wiped out certain people for statements they made about him. Whether that is true is known only to God, but we can explore whether they really made the statements attributed to them. John Lennon (1940-1980) did say in 1966, “Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn’t argue about that. I’m right and I will be proved right. We’re more popular than Jesus now. I don’t know which will go first – rock n’ roll or Christianity.”   Fourteen years later, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in New York City on December 8, 1980. The American teen magazine “Datebook” reprinted the “We’re more popular than Jesus” interview which caused a stir of protests and a rash of Beatle record and memorabilia burnings on the streets in the US.  Beatles manager, Brian Epstein released a statement saying that the words of John Lennon had been taken out of context and while in Chicago Lennon and the Beatles called a press conference and apologized to the world for his comment. The band heard of threats from the Ku Klux Klan, predictions that they would all die in a plane crash or a hurricane.  This was about 2 years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the band made a decision to stop touring and focus their attention to work in the recording studio. YouTube Video of the John Lennon Comment about Jesus John Lennon was a Rock and Roll musician who co-founded the popular British Invasion Band called the Beatles in the 1960’s. Lennon and co-writer Paul McCartney wrote hundreds of songs together along with George Harrison and Ringo Star and together they remained at the top of the charts for nearly a decade. Lennon was notorious for his little quips and often answered reporter’s questions off answers the top of his head.   One of the earliest remarks like these was when asked how the Beatles found America, Lennon responded, “Turn left at Greenland.” The Fab Four might have began in England but they gained European popularity in the rock and roll school of hard knocks working the taverns of Hamburg Germany.   The band returned to England where they were discovered playing at a nightclub by Brian Epstein who landed them a record deal and there first hits “Please Please Me” and “Love Me Do” skyrocketed them to fame.  Their 1963 US tour the U.S. included a Sunday Night live performance on the Ed Sullivan Show which introduced the for mop tops to the nearly every American family.  The band had a long run on the hit parade and in 1969 broke up and each Beatle pursued their individual solo careers.    In the Beatles Anthology documentary , George Harrison said, “They gave their money and they gave their screams, but the Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems.  Which is, you know,  much more difficult thing to give.” In his book, “Skywriting By Word of Mouth”, Lennon wrote that he and the group had grown weary of touring and thanked Jesus for the comment that drove the band from the road and into the studio where they recorded their most creative projects. After the breakup of the band, John Lennon wrote a couple of songs about God.  In his first solo album Lennon wrote, “God is a concept, by which we can measure, our pain.”   This was a song where John list Beatles, Bible, Jesus, Zimmerman (Bob Dylan), kings, yoga, Kennedy, and mantra as things that he does not believe in and says he just believes in himself and his wife Yoko. Seven years before his death, in 1973, Lennon’s biggest solo hit entitled “Imagine” included the lyrics, Imagine there’s no Heaven, it’s easy if you try.  No Hell below us, above us only sky.”  Many interpreted the song to be a message against religion but this was John Lennon vision of the world living in peace and not fighting over spiritual ideals or materialism. The question is, why would God wait so long to smite John Lennon? Tancredo Neves (1910-1985) He was elected president of Brazil in  January 1985.   Neves underwent surgery before his inauguration and was unable to take office.  Vice president elect José Sarney Costa temporarily assumed the presidency.  Neves never recovered and died from complications following his surgery.   We have not found any evidence that he made the statement about God. Cazuza (4 April 1958 – 7 July 1990)  was a Brazilian composer, singer and poet who was noted for mixing the Bosse Nova with British and American Popular music styles.    According to his obituary in the July 8, 1990 New York Times, the openly bisexual Cazuza died of aids at the age of 32, not lung cancer.   We have not found any evidence that he mocked God. Click for obit. Marilyn Monroe (1926 – 1962) was married at the age to 21 to her first husband, Jimmy Dougherty.   According to the bio on Monroe’s official web site, Dougherty, said of his wife, “She was a sweet, generous and religious girl.”  Monroe was reared as a foster child in a devoutly Christian family in Hawthorne, California but there is not much information about what her spiritual beliefs were before she died.  Monroe’s death was ruled to be “acute barbiturate poisoning” by Los Angeles County Coroner,  Dr. Thomas Noguchi.   A spokesperson for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association told TruthOrFiction.com that there was no discussion between Marilyn Monroe and Billy Graham. Bonn Scott (July 9th, 1946 –  February 19, 1980)   was the co-writer of the ACDC 1979 popular song “Highway to Hell” and at the age of 33 was pronounced dead on arrival at Kings College in London, England. The cause of death was asphyxiation as a result of vomiting after passing out after a night of heavy alcohol consumption.  The song Highway to Hell lyrics referred to the self destructive lifestyle of the rock and roll artist with the lyrics:  “Hey Satan, payin’ my dues. Playing in a rocking band.  Hey Momma, look at me I’m on my way to the promised land.  I’m on the highway to hell.” The RMS Titanic was built in 1911 for the White Star Line at the the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast in the United Kingdom.  According to the archives.gov web site an unknown White Star Line employee at the time of Titanic’s launch on May 31, 1911 said, “Not even God himself could sink this ship.”  It is not known who this person was or if in fact he built the Titanic.

Prior to the 2004 Christmas season, Target stores made the decision to no longer allow the Salvation Army to collect funds through the familiar red kettles and the bell-ringing Salvation army volunteers. That was viewed by many Christian groups as an anti-religious decision. The AFA release says that the ban on Salvation Army solicitors at Target stores is continuing into the 2005 season and, as an perhaps an additional affront to morality, Target is adding sex toys to its product line. The ban on the Salvation Army is true. Target said in 2004 that its decision was meant to accommodate the many requests it gets for solicitation and there was no indication that it was temporary.

During the 2005 holiday season a partnership was announced between Target stores and the Salvation Army to donate items to victims of the 2005 hurricanes in the U.S. as well as other needy families. The allegation that Target is going to carry sex toys has been denied by a Target spokesman, according to NBC news. The issue surrounds a product line from Trojan, the maker of condoms, called “Elexa.” WTOP radio in Washington D.C. quoted a spokesman from Trojan as saying that the Elexa line of products was going to be sold in Target stores.

This eRumor was later proven false, however, when the actor rescinded the claim that he was a born again Christian. In a video interview with 700 Club host Pat Robertson in 2006, Stallone outlined his religious reawakening. He said he had turned to Jesus and put his life into God’s hands. “There was a time when I was a very strict Catholic,” Stallone told Robertson. “Then, when I got to Hollywood, all of the sudden you’re given the keys to the candy store and temptation abounds, and I started to believe my own publicity. No question, I admit it, I lost my way. But every time I came back to ‘Rocky’ I was given a new shot in the arm, a new reawakening.” In an interview with GQ Magazine in 2010, however, the actor denied being an atheist but said he didn’t belong to a structured church. “I have no opposition to it,” Stallone said. “I think there’s great nuggets of knowledge in there, some wonderful rules to live by. Then the flip side is the amount of agony that’s caused. Original sin. That guilt. How they say, ‘if you really believe, you have to suffer for Jesus.’ Guys in military school would stick their hand into a cauldron of scalding water and yell, ‘I’m doing it for Jesus!’ I was at a retreat, and the priest said, ‘if you can’t hold your hand over this candle for five seconds, imagine what an eternity in hell will be like.’ I put my hand over the flame for two seconds, then I pulled it away.

The video suggests that it’s Barack Obama. "," The Antichrist, according to many Christian teachers, is a person who will fulfill Biblical prophesy by becoming a powerful leader in the world but will be an evil ruler, a false messiah, a person who is either against or the opposite of Jesus Christ. TuthOrFiction.com has not found any scholar of Greek, Aramaic, or Hebrew who can vouch for the interpretation of Luke 10:18 pointing to Barack Obama. The video is based entirely on the verse in Luke 10:18 , in which Jesus says, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” KJV The video says that the words in the verse were translated into English from the Greek New Testament, but were spoken by Jesus in Aramaic. It also says that Aramaic is “the most ancient form of Hebrew.” It goes on to say that the Hebrew word for “lightning” is “baraq.” Then the video goes to the book if Isaiah in the Bible, chapter 14:14 where Satan is quoted as saying “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high.” According to the video, there are several references to Satan as having fallen from the “heights” or the “heavens” and that the Hebrew word used for heights is “bamah.” Further, according to the video, there are conditions in Hebrew in which “bamah” would have sometimes been pronounced “U-bamah” or “O-bamah” and would have been translated literally as “Lightening from the heights.” Therefore “Baraq U-Bamah” or “O-bamah.” To get some insight into these claims, TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Tom Finley, Professor of Old Testament and Semitics and Chair, Old Testament and Semitics Department at Talbot Theological Seminary in La Mirada , California . Let’s look at them one at a time: Dr. Finley says that most scholars agree that Jesus probably spoke and taught in Aramaic, but that there is debate on that topic. He did point out that it is not accurate to say that “Aramaic is the most ancient form of Hebrew?” Not at all. According to Dr. Finley, Hebrew and Aramaic are two distinct languages, although closely related. He confirmed that the word for lightning is indeed “baraq” in Hebrew. In Aramaic it’s “beraq.” Dr. Finley said that in Hebrew “bama” means “back,” “hill,” or “high place, place of worship” (Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament). In Isaiah 14:14 the term refers to “the heights of the clouds” (KJV) or “the back of a cloud” (a Jewish translation called Tanakh) or “the tops of the clouds” (NRSV). However, he said that the normal word for “heavens” in Hebrew is “shamayim,” and that is the word used in Isaiah 14:12 (“How you are fallen from heaven.”) “Even if we granted that bama could mean “heaven” by itself (that is, without adding a word like “clouds” after it),” Dr. Finley said, “the combination that the video makes, “baraq u/o bama,” could only mean “lightning and heaven,” not “lightning from heaven” or “the heights”). Further, according to Dr. Finley, “What Jesus said in Luke 10:18 was, in the KJV, “Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” If he spoke it in Aramaic, then “from heaven” should be “min shemayya.” If Hebrew it should be “mehashamayim.” It is impossible that he would have used “bama” for “heaven,” whether in Hebrew or Aramaic. In Greek it is “ek tou ouranou.” And of course this doesn’t address how to account for “and” in the alleged name “baraq u/o bama.” Dr. Finley concluded, “Someone has been playing around with these languages in a rather silly way.” ","Religious"

"," This story leads into complex considerations of science and biology but the main questions it prompts are whether laminin is as important as the eRumor claims and does it have a shape like a cross. The simple answer to both questions seems to be yes. Laminin is defined by the Webster Medical Dictionary as a “glycoprotein that is a component of connective tissue basement membrane and that promotes cell adhesion.”  In other words, looking at laminin as a kind of glue isn’t far from the truth.  There are several different laminins. In their book The Laminins authors Peter Elkblom and Rupert Timpl go into more detail about both the importance of laminins and their structure.  They describe laminins that, together with other proteins, “hold cells and tissues together.”   They also say, “Electron microscopy reveals a cross-like shape for all laminins investigated so far.”  They went on to say that in solution the laminin shapes were more like a flower than a cross.  The strands of laminins do not always stand straight and at right angles, but they do consists of arms, three of which are short and one of which is long. Research has been conducted on laminins in connection with numerous conditions and diseases.  It has been found, for example, that people with congenital muscular dystrophies do not have  laminin-alpha2, which is normally found in the layer of cells around muscle fibers and other cells important to the structural integrity of muscle cells.

"," The U.S. fought in two separate wars over state-sponsored Muslim pirates along Africa’s Barbary Coast in the early 1800s. The eRumor’s claims about the lead up to the Barbary Wars are also accurate. After the U.S won its independence, France stopped protecting U.S. ships in the Mediterranean, according to papers collected by the Library of Congress. Thomas Jefferson, then United States Minister to France, grew increasingly frustrated with paying ransom to the Barbary pirates after French protection ended. Jefferson tried to negotiate an accord with France and Great Britain, but that fell through.Jefferson later wrote in a letter , “From what I learn from the temper of my countrymen and their tenaciousness of their money, it will be more easy to raise ships and men to fight these pirates into reason, than money to bribe them.” The eRumor’s recounting of an interaction between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams and an ambassador to Tripoli about the motives for the pirate attacks is also accurate, according to a book of diplomatic correspondences . Jefferson and Adams wrote: “The Ambassador answered us, that (the aggression) was founded on the laws of their Prophet; that it was written in their Koran, that all nationals who should not have acknowledged their authority, were sinners; that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners; and that every Mussulman who was slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.” George  Washington attempted to forge treaties with Barbary Coast states, as  the eRumor claimed, and he expressed frustration about France’s role  in a letter he  penned in 1796. Just after Algiers pirates had released American  hostages in accordance with a treaty, Washington received news that  pirates from Tunis had taken more American hostages. “’Tis difficult  to understand precisely what the French government design relative  to this country,” Washington replied. As it turned out, France and Great Britain benefited from the Barbary pirates, and they may have even supported them. The State Department’s Office of the Historian said , “The practice of state-sponsored piracy and ransoming of captives was not wholly unusual for its time. Many European states commissioned privateers to attack each others’ shipping and also participated in the transatlantic slave trade. The two major European powers, Great Britain and France, found it expedient to encourage the Barbary States’ policy and pay tribute to them, as it allowed their merchant shipping an increased share of the Mediterranean trade, and Barbary leaders chose not to challenge the superior British or French navies.” After  Jefferson was elected president, Tripoli declared war on America in  1801. War followed with Algiers in 1815, but the U.S. had  bulked up its naval fleet for the War of 1812, and the war ended quickly,  according to Library of Congress documents .

"," It’s true that an independent group of Harvard students planned to host a black mass reenactment on the campus. The group later dropped its sponsorship, and the event was held off campus on May 12, 2014. The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club announced in a statement on May 9, 2014, that it no longer supported holding the black mass reenactment on campus and that the event had been moved to an undisclosed location off campus. “We do not agree with the student group’s decision to stage an event that is so deeply disturbing and offensive to many in the Harvard community and beyond,” Robert Neugeboren, dean of students and affairs at the Harvard Extension School, said. “While we support the ability of all our students to explore difficult issues, we also encourage them to do so in ways that are sensitive to others.” Harvard President Drew Faust released a statement condemning the black mass reenactment as denigration and mockery of Catholicism. “The decision by a student club to sponsor an enactment of this ritual is abhorrent; it represents a fundamental affront to the values of inclusion, belonging and mutual respect that must define our community,” Faust said. Still, Faust said, the university wouldn’t force a student group to cancel an event because the campus was committed to free expression. Before the independent student group decided on its own not to host the event, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley also weighed in. O’Malley said black mass was a “ritual performed as a sacrilegious parody of the Roman Catholic Mass,” according to a report from the Boston Pilot , which publishes news on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.

"Gideons Banned From Military Bases-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gideons-military-bases/"," Two days after the presidential election, the Department of Defense issued an order that effectively bans the Gideons from military bases.

"," The Gideons International is an organization of Christian business and professional men who are “dedicated to saving the lost through personal witnessing and the distribution of God’s Word,” the Bible. It is known for distributing Bibles around the world including to U.S. military personnel. The eRumor is based on an actual order issued by the Department of Defense, but it does not ban the Gideons from military bases and does not take effect on November 21. On November 6, 2008, a Department of Defense (DOD) memorandum was published that enacted a policy regarding access by any “non-Federal Entity” to Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS). That is where applicants to the military go through various kinds of testing to determine qualifications for joining one of the armed forces. In other words, it does not apply to all military bases, just the Military Entrance Processing Stations. Also, the memo does not prohibit religious literature at the MEPS, but only when it is not authorized in writing by the MEPS commander. Such literature cannot create the impression that the government is sponsoring or disfavoring any religion in particular. There cannot be any proselytizing, preaching, or spiritual counseling, or fund raising by any non-Federal Entity. The memo also specifies that “This policy does not apply to religious organizations operating within a MEPS under the auspices of the Chaplaincy of any DOD service or department.” In other words, authorized non-Federal Entities are not affected, although they do need to function under the guidelines established by the government for religious organizations. Whoever wrote this eRumor said that “This is being battled in the courts, which is why I am not allowed to send you an actual copy of the order.” TruthOrFiction.com, however, was not able to find any court action being waged and the Gideons International told us they were not taking any legal action against the order. updated 11/25/08 ","Religious"

"What did Megachurch pastor Rick Warren Really Say about Gays and Gay Marriage?","2015-03-17 18:06:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rick-warren-prop8/"," A forwarded email about a CNN interview with Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback Church in Southern California.  It says that Warren disavowed support of Proposition 8. "," In April, 2009, Rick Warren of Saddleback Church in California started granting media interviews for the first time since the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Of particular interest to interviewers was Warren’s reaction to the controversy that resulted from his acceptance of the invitation from Mr. Obama to say a prayer at the president-to-be’s inauguration. Obama had been a friend to the gay community and there was an outcry that he asked an evangelical pastor who had endorsed Proposition 8 on the November ballot in California, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Several articles and emails circulated on the Internet criticizing Warren after an April 6, 2009 interview on CNN with Larry King. One of the criticisms in an article from Baptist Press was that during the King interview Warren denied ever giving an endorsement to Proposition 8. Other critics said he seemed to be backing away from opposition to gay marriage. In the interview, Warren did not deny ever endorsing the measure. He told King that during the two-year campaign for Proposition 8 he did not take a stand on it, but a week before the election he sent a message to his congregation in support of Proposition 8. Here is the exact quote: “During the whole Proposition 8 thing, I never once went to a meeting, never once issued a statement, never — never once even gave an endorsement in the two years Prop 8 was going. The week before the — the vote, somebody in my church said, Pastor Rick, what — what do you think about this? And I sent a note to my own members that said, I actually believe that marriage is — really should be defined, that that definition should be — say between a man and a woman.” That statement was softer than the wording of his message to the members of Saddleback Church that Warren sent in October, 2008, just before the election. In it he said, “Now let me say this really clearly: we support Proposition 8 — and if you believe what the Bible says about marriage, you need to support Proposition 8.” A statement was issued on April 9, 2009 by Saddleback Church clarifying the statements on Larry King. It said, “Throughout his pastoral ministry spanning nearly 30 years, Dr. Warren has remained committed to the biblical definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, for life — a position held by most fellow Evangelical pastors. He has further stressed that for 5,000 years, EVERY culture and EVERY religion has maintained this worldview. When Dr. Warren told Larry King that he never campaigned for California’s Proposition 8, he was referring to not participating in the official two-year organized advocacy effort specific to the ballot initiative in that state, based on his focus and leadership on other compassion issues. Because he’s a pastor, not an activist, in response to inquiries from church members, he issued an email and video message to his congregation days before the election confirming where he and Saddleback Church stood on this issue.” On the King show, Warren also said he had issued an apology to the gay community which critics took to mean that he was sorry he supported proposition 8. The church statement of April 9 addressed that issues as well. It said, “During the King interview, Dr. Warren also referenced a letter of apology that he sent to gay leaders whom he knew personally. However, that mea culpa was not with respect to his statements or position on Proposition 8 nor the biblical worldview on marriage. Rather, he apologized for his comments in an earlier Beliefnet interview expressing his concern about expanding or redefining the definition of marriage beyond a husband-wife relationship, during which he unintentionally and regrettably gave the impression that consensual adult same sex relationships were equivalent to incest or pedophilia.” updated 04/13/09 ","Religious"
"Deadly Aftermath of Harold Camping’s May 21, 2011 Judgement Day Prediction-Truth! & Unconfirmed!","2015-03-17 18:06:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/vietnam-aftermath/"," There are reports of suicides and even murders resulting from the Doomsday prediction of Family Radio’s Bible Teacher Harold Camping that judgment day would come on May 21, 2011 and that the true believers in Jesus Christ would be raptured to heaven. "," Harold Camping is a self-taught Bible teacher who was one of the founders of Family Radio, a collection of radio stations and affiliates based in Oakland, California. Camping hosted a live Monday through Friday talk show on the network during which he spread his teachings and took phone calls answering Bible questions. Camping first attracted attention outside of his followers when he wrote a book titled 1994? in which he predicted that the end of the world would probably take place between September 15 and 17 of that year. When it didn’t he said that he’d gotten his calculations wrong. Camping bases his views on his own brand of Biblical numerology. He’s an engineer by training and likes playing with numbers. His calculations are a little hard to follow and some are based on assumptions of the dates of events like the creation or the world or Noah’s flood. He became a fresh subject of news headlines in 2011 when he began to intensely promote his conviction that on May 21, 2011, there would be catastrophic earthquakes and other natural phenomena harkening the beginning of severe judgment on the world. He also predicted that those who were “true believers” in Jesus Christ would be taken from the earth and go to heaven on that date. Associated with that he said that after a period of judgement the world would come to an end on October 2 1, 2011. Camping was alone in his assertions. No other church, denomination, or major pastor or Bible teacher supported his theory and most condemned it. During the months leading up to May 21, Camping spread the word about judgement day through his radio broadcast, which is heard both in the United States and several foreign countries, and there were reports that Family Radio spent millions of dollars buying advertising time and funding a caravan of motor homes that went from city to city to warn people about the pending event. The predicted date came and went without anything happening. Harold Camping went into seclusion for a few days then emerged to say that he would explain everything in a special radio broadcast on his network. In that program, Camping announced that he was at first bewildered when nothing seemed to happen but that he then realized that judgment day did indeed come on May 21, but it was spiritual not physical and that was why nobody noticed it. In June, 2011, Camping was hospitalized because of a stroke and later transferred to a nursing home. Family Radio announced an end to his program and substituted it with another. Over the following weeks, however, information started emerging about some of the fallout of his prediction. Nobody knows how many people took him seriously, but some stories came to light that caused great concern about the impact of his failed prediction. A few days after the May 21, a Florida man who was visiting family in California jumped into a reservoir in Contra Loma regional Park in Antioch saying he had to “get to God.” Family members said the 25-year old man became erratic and “started talking about God more profoundly…” After watching a video about UFO’s he started quoting Bible verses from the book of Ezekiel and insisted that he had to go to the park. One of the detectives in the case said the man “…told his family that he now understood the Bible and that God was going to come see him.” He dived into the reservoir. His brother and his wife jumped in to save him and brought him ashore, but he jumped back into the lack and drowned. Investigators said that the coverage of Camping’s prediction was to blame. In Palmdale, California, authorities say that a woman who wanted to protect her children from the “tribulation” slit the throats of her two daughters before cutting her own throat. This happened in March of 2011. The injuries were not fatal, however, and all survived. The daughters were 11 and 14. In Michigan, a group of teenagers who say they were celebrating the failed prediction of the May 21 rapture decided to mark the occasion by jumping from a bridge. A 17-year old who did not know how to swim was swept away by the current and drowned. News reports from Taiwan told of an elderly man who jumped out of a building on May 5 saying he had heard that doomsday was nearing. News reports in June told of a Malawian man who pleaded guilty to “circulating false documents” about the judgment day prediction. He was identified as a 39-year old bicycle repairman who had been spreading the world about May 21. Police charged him with “circulating false documents that threatened the peace and security of citizens.” He was given a six-month suspended sentence. There were also news reports from Vietnam that an ethnic group in the northern reaches of the country, the tribal Hmong people, were among those who took the prophecy to heart. They had heard it through missionary radio. The news reports said there were “thousands” of people gathering on a hillside to await their trip to heaven. In July, 2011, James Jacob Prasch of Moriel Ministries traveled to Vietnam and met with Hmong leaders. He reported that more than 7,000 Hmongs did gather on a mountain with hopes that they were going to be delivered from their suffering at the hands of the Communist government. Prosch was told that at one point police and military police opened gunfire on the crowd and that many were killed and buried in mass graves on the site. He also said that two pastors were beheaded and that many thousands are missing and either among the dead, among the imprisoned, or scattered in the local jungle. updated 07/16/11 ","Religious"

"," The Phillipsburg school board in New Jersey voted 8 to 0, with three abstaining, to terminate and removed  Walter Tutka from substitute teachers list for the 2012 to 2013 academic year despite protests from a huge number of supporters who spoke to the school board on behalf of Tutka.   This according to a January 14, 2013 article by WFMZ-TV News in Allentown, PA. The article said that earlier last fall, Tutka quoted a passage from the book of Matthew saying, “So the last will be first, and the first will be last” to a student who was the last to the classroom.  After the student inquired about the passage seven times of the teacher, Tutka showed him the source of the verse from his own personal copy of the New Testament. The article also said, “The school board and administration offered very little information upon voting to terminate Tutka, citing the issue as a confidential personnel matter. When asked by members of the public to give specific reasons for Tutka’s firing, legal counsel for the board would only say that ‘the board will not comment on personnel matters.'” updated 01/17/13 ","Religious"

The eRumor first surfaced in 2013. The original version falsely claimed that the mayor of Ath, Belgium, had resisted requests from Muslims to remove pork from school lunch menus. “Muslims must understand that they have to adapt to Belguim, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because that’ where they chose to immigrate,” Ath Mayor Marc Duvivier allegedly said.

A modified version of the eRumor re-surfaced in November 2014. The new version was exactly the same as the old version, except references to “the mayor of Ath” were changed to “the mayor of Quebec.” There haven’t been any credible reports of Muslim parents requesting that pork be removed from schools in Quebec or Belgium.

"," TruthOrFiction.Com has found no evidence of this being true.  A search of the MSNBC website found no such interview in the archives and inquiries sent to Matthews have yet to be responded. According to a March 24, 2013 article in London’s Telegraph , the transcript of the interview was published on the website of the Roman Catholic diocese in Salford but was later taken down because it could not be verified.  Salford is a city in England that is East of Manchester. There are indications in the transcript that this may be a hoax. Matthews is a Roman Catholic as well as a professional interviewer.  A professional would not have begun an interview by addressing a Catholic Cardinal with “Welcome Cardinal.”  The correct protocol when addressing a Catholic Cardinal is “Your Eminence,” according to “How to Address Church Officials” found posted on the website Catholiceducation.org .  Cardinals may also be addressed by “Your Lordship” but it would be considered bad form to say “Welcome Cardinal” without including the clergyman’s last name. Another clue that this could possibly be a hoax is that the spelling of Matthew’s name is incorrect in the transcript of the forwarded email. Posted 4/23/13 ","Religious"

One follower of Osteen’s Facebook page responded to the post, “Joel you need to know Gods word Moses was not there when God stopped the sun for Joshua or the three teenagers in the fiery furnace they happened after God took Moses up on Mount Sinai to die for his disbelief.” Rev. Osteen has come under fire in the past from critics of his ministry who say he preaches a false Gospel of prosperity. Posted 09/19/14 ","Religious"
"The Inspiration for Albrecht Dürer’s Famous Artwork “The Praying Hands”-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/praying-hands/"," German artist Albrecht Dürer modeled his famous 16th century brush sketch after the suffering hands of his brother, Albert, who supported Albrecht’s early art studies by working in mines.

The fictional tale of Albrecht Dürer’s masterpiece was first published in Og Mandino’s book “ A Better Way to Live ” in 1990.  Mandino did not report the legend of Albert and Albrecht Durer as truth in his book. The story was told to him by a rabbi, and Mandino called it “partially apocryphal but poignant.” Art historians and forensic experts have also concluded that the hands Dürer sketched aren’t those of a laborer. “The praying hands in Dürer’s drawing are thin, with elongated fingers and well groomed nails, not calloused from manual work. The forearms are elegantly clothed, with sleeves made of expensive material, obviously the dress of an affluent person,” W.R. Albury and Dr. George Weisz, both professors at the University of New England, said in Hektoen International . The professors said the hands also show mild aging and no signs of swelling, which would likely result from years of manual labor. Posted 03/31/14 ","Religious"

"," According to both Oprah Winfrey’s and Marianne    Williamson’s websites this daily one hour radio program through Oprah and    Friends Radio on XM satellite radio went on the air January 1, 2008. It is a one-year show based on A Course in Miracles.  Winfrey’s web    site describes the program as “a self-study program of spiritual    psychotherapy contained in three books. It is not a religion, but rather a    psychological mind-training base on universal spiritual themes.” Marianne Williamson is a popular lecturer who has authored several books    and promotes z”A Course in Miracles.” A Course In Miracles first came out in 1976.  Psychologist Helen    Schucman describes herself as the “scribe” of the book rather than the    author.  She said that she and fellow psychologist William Thetford    “scribed” the book from an “inner source.”  Schucman has said that it    was channeled to her by Jesus Christ. The course of teachings makes frequent reference to Jesus and uses    Christian terminology, but many Evangelical Christian teachers and    apologists regard it has heretical.

In March, 2008, a video began circulating widely on the Internet that used    some similar material as in the forwarded email version.

It cannot     come from anywhere else” is a quote from the Course of Miracles     (workbook, lesson 70). “There is no sin.” This is a quote from A Course in Miracles.  “ The     exercises teach sin is not real, and all that you believe must come from     sin will never happen, for it has no cause. Accept Atonement with an     open mind, which cherishes no lingering belief that you have made a     devil of God’s Son. There is no sin.

"Houston Mayor Annise Parker Subpoenas Sermons-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/annise-parker-subpoenas/"," Houston Mayor Annise Parker allegedly handed down subpoenas for transcripts of sermons that pastors gave at local churches in response to opposition to an anti-discrimination ordinance that city officials signed into law in May 2014. "," Five pastors from Houston were subpoenaed to turn over written documents, communications and sermons in response to a lawsuit filed by opponents of an anti-discrimination ordinance. The subpoenas called for transcripts of “all speeches, presentations or sermons” that touched on specific topics like “the mayor” and “gender identity.” They came to light when lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom organization filed a motion to quash the subpoenas on the pastors’ behalves in October 2014. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, the city’s first openly gay mayor, signed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) into law in May 2014. HERO bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, the Houston Chronicle reports . The measure sparked controversy, and its opponents vowed to collect the roughly 17,000 signatures required to trigger a referendum vote for its repeal in November 2014. By August 2014, opponents of HERO, led by the Houston Area Pastor Council, delivered more than 50,000 signatures to city offices. But Parker and City Attorney David Feldmen said only about half of the 5,000 pages of signatures were valid. That left the final signature tally at 15,249, short of the threshold to spark a referendum, the Houston Chronicle reports . HERO opponents quickly announced plans to fight Parker’s decision in court. By mid-August 2014, HERO opponents had filed a lawsuit to force a referendum vote on HERO. In the meantime, the anti-discrimination ordinance was placed on hold. The subpoenas were handed down in response to the lawsuit filed by HERO opponents. Feldmen said during a press conference on October 15, 2014, that “there’s no question the wording was overly broad,” but the purpose was to learn what instructions were given to collect signatures for the petition. Feldman said the city would clarify what information it was looking for, and he said it was “unfortunate” that it had been construed as an effort to infringe upon religious beliefs.

"Retailers urging Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas?-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/merrychristmas/"," 2007 Update: The American Family Association issued an alert saying that Lowes in its 2007 Christmas catalog had 56 pages of Christmas items including what it called “Family Trees,” but the word “Christmas” occurred only twice. The original eRumor was in various forwarded emails in 2005 saying that large retailers like Wal-Mart and Target are minimizing “Christmas” and emphasizing “holidays” at the end of the year and even telling their employees to stop using “Merry Christmas.” "," Regarding the 2007 update and Lowes, the American Family Association said that it received word from Lowes that the company was “proudly committed to selling Christmas trees” and said that calling them “Family Trees” was an error that was not caught before the catalog was distributed.  Lowes told the AFA that it would refer to them as “Christmas trees” during other advertising during the Christmas season.” Christmas 2005 was the year of  the “greeting wars” between Christians and American retailers. This story had several sources. The American Family Association posted a petition on their website for  people to sign in protest of decisions it says have been made by several  retailers to ban the use of “Merry Christmas” in advertising  and in-store promotion.  The American Family Association action was  originally about Target Stores, which it said, had banned using  “Merry Christmas” in its stores, something that Target denied. Popular Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly did a show on which he  offered a list of retailers that he said refused to use “Merry  Christmas” in their store advertising. The Reverend Jerry Falwell lent his support to the “Friend of Foe  Christmas Campaign” that was launched by the conservative legal  organization Liberty Counsel, which promised to take legal action  against anyone who spread what it saw as misinformation about how  Christmas can be celebrated in schools and public spaces. There was also a brief protest against Wal-Mart led by The Catholic  League, which said that Wal-Mart was discriminating against Christmas  while promoting alternative holiday celebrations such as Kwanzaa and  Hanukkah. The Catholic League published the contents of an email it says  was received from Wal-Mart by a woman who complained that “Merry  Christmas” was being replaced by “Happy Holidays.”   According to the Catholic League, the email said: “Walmart  is a world wide organization and must remain conscious of this. The  majority of the world still has different practices other than “christmas”  which is an ancient tradition that has its roots in Siberian shamanism.  The colors associated with “christmas” red and white are  actually a representation of of the aminita mascera mushroom. Santa is  also borrowed from the Caucuses, mistletoe from the Celts, yule log from  the Goths, the time from the Visigoth and the tree from the worship of  Baal. It is a wide wide world. “ The  boycott was called off after being given visibility on WoldNetDaily.   The Catholic League said that Wal-Mart apologized for the email, field  the employee who wrote it, and made some changes to its website that  reflect “Christmas,” not just “holidays.” In an official statement Target said it “…serves and employs a  diverse range of people…” and that their “…merchandise,  advertising, and marketing include a diversity of traditions,  particularly at this time of year.”  Target denied that it has  asked employees to avoid saying “Merry Christmas” and let  that decision rest with the employee. A visit to the Target website at www.target.com by TruthOrFiction.com in late November, 2005, seemed to confirm the  avoidance of Christmas except as it related to specific products. There  was nothing on the home page about “Christmas” or “Merry  Christmas.”  Instead the references were to a “Holiday  Gift Finder” feature and gift cards decorated with snowmen and  Christmas trees but termed “Holiday Gift Cards.”  On the  Holiday Gift Finder page there are links for “All Things  Holiday,” “Holiday Catalogs”, and “Holiday Shipping  Dates.”  At the Lowes website (www.lowes.com) there was what   was clearly a red and green Christmas tree stand but it’s called  “The Ultimate Holiday Tree Stand.”  The same with Wal-Mart. Sears, Home Depot, Costco, and KMart although  this is not a new trend.  We went through the archives of several  of the homepages for major retailers extending back to 1997 and found  that most of them by that time had begun referring to  “holidays” rather than “Christmas” largely because  of the trend of regarding November through January as both Jewish and  Christian holidays in the U.S. Last updated 11/27/05 ","Religious"

They claim to have DNA studies that support their conclusions. "," The article in the eRumor is     from the February 26, 2007 issue of Time Magazine and was written by Tim     McGirk.  It describes Cameron’s conclusions and his documentary     accurately.  It is to be titled The Lost Tomb of Jesus and     will air on the Discovery channel.  A Discovery Channel release     says that film-maker Simcha Jacobovici has gathered scientific evidence     to support his claim that a 2,000-year-old cave in Jerusalem’s East     Talpiot neighborhood once held the remains of Jesus, his mother Mary,     Mary Magdalene, and possibly the son born to Jesus and Mary Magdalene,     Judah.  Jacobovici is Israeli-born but lives in Canada. Also on     February 26 Cameron and his colleagues held a news conference in New     York about the documentary. The tomb was found in 1980 during construction of the     neighborhood.  Ten ossuaries (a container for holding the bones of     the dead) were found inside. It has been sealed by the Israel     Antiquities Authority (IAA) but the film-makers said they found it with     the help of people in the neighborhood, opened the cave, and were able     to collect some evidence and do filming before a representative of the     IAA asked them to leave and re-seal the entrance.  Cameron says he     hopes there can be further official excavation of the cave.      Cameron and Jacobovici claim that six of ossuaries have inscriptions     that thread them to “Jesus son of Joseph,” “Mary,”     “Jose”, “Matia”, Mariamne” and a child named     “Judah son of Jesus.”  They say that the Jesus ossuary is     that of Jesus of Nazareth, the Mary is that of his mother, the Matia is     another relative of the family, that Mariamne is Mary Magdalene, and     that Judah is the son of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  Their claim is     based largely on statistical evidence, not direct forensic proof.      The team has a statistician who feels that the odds of their theory is     right are very high. They did say that they were able to get enough of     what they wanted from the “Jesus” and “Mariamne”     boxes to determine that they were not blood relatives.  They     theorize that Jesus and “Mariamne” were a couple and that     “Judah” could have been their child, but they have no proof of     it. In Jerusalem, however, Israeli archeologists have not reserved their     words of criticism of the documentary.  Professor Amos     Kloner, who led the excavation of the Talpiot cave, told the Jerusalem     Post that in his view the documentary was “…’brain confusion’     that mixed fact with fiction and ‘dressed up facts’ in a Hollywood-like     manner which could easily lead laymen astray.”  He dismissed     the documentary’s claims as “impossible” and     “nonsense.” Updated 2-26-07 ","Religious"

"Muslims Are Meeting to Pray on the Capitol Steps on September 25, 2009-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jumamah-capitol-steps/"," A forwarded eRumor warning that Muslims will be gathering at the steps in front of the the US Capitol Building in Washington DC on September 25, 2009.   The email goes on to say that 50,000 are expected to attend to pray for 15 hours and that the organizers got their inspiration from President Obama’s speech in Cairo, Egypt where he said the United States was no longer a Christian Nation.  The eRumor also asks, “Do you think Christians would be allowed to do an event like this?” "," The prayer event is real and will take place on the steps of the US Capitol Building in Washington DC on September 25, 2009.   The event is being called Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill.   The official website is: http://www.islamoncapitolhill.com According to a September 14, 2009 World Bulletin article , Organizers have considered the Jummah Prayer on Capital Hill as a Day of Islamic Unity.”    The main organizer, Hassen Abdellah, expects 50,000 people of all faiths to be in attendance and told reporters that the event will solely consist of prayer, readings from the Koran and will not include political speeches or placards. The eRumor makes it appear that this approval of a Muslim prayer event on the Capitol steps is something favorable to Muslims that would not be granted to Christians.   Use of the US Capitol for religious events is not uncommon and a variety of events at the Capitol Steps are allowed as long as the permit applications are submitted and the guidelines are strictly followed. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, in his book “Rediscovering God in America”  said that Thomas Jefferson, author of the famous “the wall of separation of Church and State,” was the first U.S. President to allow the public use of the Capitol building religiously—and it was for church services.  Gingrich also wrote that In 1952 Congress issued a joint resolution calling for a prayer service on the Capitol steps which was led in the pouring rain by Rev. Billy Graham.   The event was attended by thousands of people which prompted the 1953 construction of a Congressional Chapel on the federal premises which today is only open to members of Congress and invited guests. Recent religious events at the Capitol steps include the 58th annual National Day of Prayer observance on May 7, 2009 which included a Bible reading marathon. 90 continuous hours of reading from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation has taken place on the Capitol steps every year since 1979.  The Promise Keeper Organization of Christian Men also have met at the Capitol steps to pray. President Obama has taken a lot of hits for a statement he made in his 2009 trip to Turkey. Critics of the president have said that he declared the United States “no longer a Christian nation” and that he said that the U.S. was a “Moslem nation.” His exact remark was, “I’ve said before that one of the great strengths of the United States is…that although we have a very large Christian population, we do not consider ourselves a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation we consider ourselves a nation of citizens.” Critics of the president considered his remarks a rejection of the long-held belief that America is a Christian nation. Supporters pointed out that he wasn’t discounting Christianity or elevating Islam. He was emphasizing the unity of a country of diverse citizens with diverse faiths. The president’s statement echoed his belief when Obama was an Illinois State Senator he was the keynote speaker at the “Building a Covenant for A New America” conference sponsored by a group called the “Call to Renewal.” He told attendees that the United States is no longer a Christian nation but a nation of citizens with different beliefs. President Obama also said this on a 2009 trip to Cairo, Egypt Islamic Prayer Day at the White House – Fiction! Another version of this eRumor began circulating in December of 2009 saying that the Islamic Day of Prayer was at the White House. It also included a picture of the President removing his shoes in apparent preparation for  prayer. This Islamic prayer gathering, as we reported above, did not take place at the White House and the picture had nothing to do with that event.  The photo was taken when  President Obama toured a mosque in Turkey during his April 2009 tour.

In an official statement , Kent Lovett, the school’s principal, said the student approached the teacher for guidance on the paper early in the writing process. The teacher asked the student if she wanted to stay with that subject, or chose another. “The student expressed her desire to keep Jesus as her hero, and the teacher replied, ‘Okay, that will be fine.’ As the conversation proceeded, the teacher assisted the student in gathering and organizing her ideas so that she could continue, which she did after returning to her seat,” Lovett said.

"Japan’s Treatment of Muslims-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/japan-muslim/"," An email alleges that tight restrictions are in place to prevent the spread of Islam in Japan because Muslims are viewed as “fundamentalists” who are not willing to deviate from Muslim laws. "," This eRumor contains false claims and generalizations about Japan’s treatment of Muslims. The Japanese government regularly welcomes political leaders from Islamic and Arabic states. In July 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the Islamic Diplomatic Corps to Japan, an official government press release reports. “I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,” Prime Minister Abe said. “I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence….” Islamic and Arabic studies are also not restricted in Japan, as the eRumor suggests. It’s true that the International University of Japan in Tokyo does not offer courses on Arabic or Islamic languages — however, the only language courses the university offers are English and Japanese, according to the university’s website . Still, the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo features an extensive offering of such courses, and it regularly features political and academic leaders from various Islamic and Arabic states, according to the school’s website . The eRumor’s claim that Muslims cannot become Japanese citizens is also false, according to a Japanese blog that specializes in immigration issues called “Becoming Legally Japanese.” “Because there is no place on the written online application for one’s religion, the Ministry of Justice can’t publish statistics showing the religions (or races) of naturalization candidates; they can only publish sex and former nationality statistics,” the blog reports. “However, looking at the nationality statistics, we can find hundreds of examples of people from Islamic states (ex. Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan) as well as people from nation-states where the official state religion is Islam (ex. Egypt) and greater than 90 percent of the population is Muslim. Doing a quick web search, I can find Japanese immigration lawyers who specialize in people from Indonesia and brag of a 100 percent success rate.” Japan requires special visas for visitors, workers and students who are not from one of 66 countries that Japan has a “general visa exemption arrangement” with, according to an official website . But there are no official travel restrictions on Muslims, or practitioners of any other faith. It’s also untrue that Japan does not allow Arabic or Islamic schools in the country. The International Islamia School Otsuka in Tokyo is just one example. Additionally, the Japanese government funded construction of a number of madrasas that were completed in Afghanistan in December 2012, Pajhwok Afghan News reports . There are also no restrictions on Japanese women marrying Muslim men, according to the Islamic Center of Japan’s website . The eRumor’s allegation that a Japanese woman would be “considered an outcast forever” by her family for marrying a Muslim man — like many other allegations in the eRumor — is a generalization that is impossible to prove or disprove.

"The film “The Golden Compass” is a controversy among Christians-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/golden-compass/"," A warning about a new film for December, 2007, titled “The Golden Compass”.  There are several emails but all of them say that the film is based on the writings of an atheist author from England and that the film is anti-religious and anti-Christian. "," “The Golden Compass” was scheduled for release December 7, 2007.  The stars include 12-year-old Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, and Ian McKellen. The film is based on a novel titled “Northern Lights” (“The Golden Compass” in the United States), which is the first in a trilogy titled “His Dark Materials” written by English author Phillip Pullman. He first published “Northern Lights” in 1995 followed by “The Subtle Knife” in 1997 and “The Amber Spyglass” in 2000. They are targeted toward children.  The trilogy has resulted in several awards for Pullman including the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children’s Book Award and the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. The main character in the film is a young girl named Lyra (played by Dakota Blue Richards) who lives in a parallel universe to ours. There has been much criticism from Christians about Pullman’s novels and protest against the release of the first film in the series.  The Catholic League has called for a boycott of “The Golden Compass.” Film critic and author Dr. Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and Television commission calls “The Golden Compass” “An atheist’s ‘Narnia’ knockoff,” referring to the best selling books “The Chronicles of Narnia” by C.S. Lewis.  The first film of the Narnia series was released internationally as “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.”   The second Narnia film, “Prince Caspian,” is schedule for release in 2008. Many view Pullman’s books as a response to “The Chronicles of Narnia” but with an emphasis on “scientific materialism” over religion.  Pullman has criticized “The Chronicles of Narnia” as “religious propaganda.”  In 2001 he told Guardian Unlimited “I hate the Narnia books, and I hate them with deep and bitter passion, with their view of childhood as a golden age from which sexuality and adulthood are a falling away.” Baehr describes Pullman as “an avowed atheist who has dedicated his life to undermining Christianity and the church among young readers.”  He says Pullman “represents God as a decrepit and perverse angel in his novels, who captures the dead in a ‘prison camp’ afterlife.”  One fallen angel says: The Authority, God, the  Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father, the  Almighty – those were all names he gave himself. He was never the  creator. He was an angel like ourselves – the first angel, true, the  most powerful, but he was formed of Dust as we are, and Dust is only a  name for what happens when matter begins to understand itself. According to Baehr, one heroine in the story turns from the Church when she realizes “there wasn’t any God at all and … the Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that’s all.” The Church just kept her from finding love, thinking freely and pursuing bodily pleasures like sex.  The Sunday Times describes the story as “…a quest that takes in the literal death of ‘God’, who is no more than a wizened, foetus-like invalid…Lyra releases human beings from attachment to the afterlife.” According to “The Golden Compass” website, a key feature of the film is that “In Lyra’s world, a person’s soul lives on the outside of their body, in the form of a daemon — an animal spirit that accompanies them through life.”  Each of the characters in the film has a daemon, which include birds, monkeys, snow leopards, reptiles, and moths. The web site has a feature to help visitors discover their own daemons by answering a series of questions. There are voices from among Christians who support Pullman.  Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has proposed that “His Dark Materials” be taught in schools as religious education.  His is among voices who view Pullman’s writings as an attack on religious oppression, not Christianity.

The Verse The eRumor is based on whether the cloth was a “napkin” and was “folded” in the empty tomb of Jesus. The story is based on the account of Jesus’ resurrection in John 20:7. Here is how that verse is translated in one of the most widely-used versions of the Bible, the King James Version: “…and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.” We checked seven of the most respected translations of the Bible to see how the translators handled this verse. Three of them translated the cloth as a “napkin” (King James, American Standard, Revised Standard Version).  Others translated it as a “burial cloth” (New International Version), a “handkerchief” (The New King James Version), or a “face-cloth” (New American Standard Bible).   The Greek word is saudarion, which comes from a Latin word for “sweat.”  It connotes, for example, a towel for wiping sweat.  It is used in the Greek for a towel or cloth, but not specifically a table napkin. The other key word is “folded.”  Was the burial cloth or napkin left folded in the tomb? Two of the translations used the word “folded” (New International Version, New King James Version).  Others translated the word as “rolled up” (New American Standard Bible, American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version), or “wrapped together” (King James Version). The Greek word is “entulisso,” which is from words that may mean to twist or to entwine. The bottom line is that there is not agreement that it was a table napkin and not agreement that it was neatly folded in any meaningful way.  The main meaning of John 20:7 is to convey that the cloth, which was placed over Jesus head or face at burial, was separate from the rest of his grave clothes. The Story We have checked numerous Bible study sources and have found nothing about this alleged Jewish custom of the folded napkins.  We did not find any Bible scholars who have used this story and illustration about the meaning of the folded napkin. Additionally we talked with a Jewish rabbi friend of TruthOrFiction.com’s who has been a life-long Orthodox Jew, a Jewish scholar, and lives in Jerusalem, Israel, and he said he’d never heard of it The only references to this story that we found are from Internet postings and emails that seem to have originated in 2007.

"Dutch Give up Multiculturalism-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dutch-multiculturalism/"," Viral emails and blog posts allege that legislation in the Netherlands “abandons multiculturalism” and deters Muslim immigrants and Islamic traditions. "," Dutch lawmakers have enacted a number of laws over the last decade to   make its immigrant populations more “integrated,” but this eRumor gets   some of the details wrong. Some of the eRumor’s claims are based on   legislative developments from 2011 that didn’t come to fruition. The   eRumor repeats an article from the   Gatestone Institute International Policy Council from June 2011. The   original article accurately reported on pending legislation, but the   eRumor omitted information and changed dates to make it appear more   current. In one instance, the eRumor claims a law   prohibiting face-covering Islamic burqas went into effect on Jan. 1,   2014. The original story cited a prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2013. The point is moot, however, because the legislation   was never approved. It got shelved in 2012 when the country’s   centre-right coalition collapsed, according to a BBC report . About 300 women out of the 16 million people who   live in the country wear traditional Islamic dress. About 5 percent of   the population identify themselves as Muslims, the BBC reports. Still, it’s true that laws to “integrate” immigrant   populations — and Muslims in particular — have been approved in the   Netherlands over the last decade, according to Human Rights Watch. “The policies were adopted during a period of   heightened public concern about the impact that migrant communities have   on social cohesion, with a particular criticism of the supposed lack of   integration among Moroccan and Turkish migrant communities,” according   to a report by Human   Rights Watch. Under the policies, immigrants have to pass an   “integration test” and prove that they can financially support their   families to receive citizenship, according to the report.

"Dr. James Dobson endorsed homosexual marriage?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dobson-partnerships/"," TruthOrFiction.com has had inquiries about whether pro-family advocate Dr. James Dobson of Focus On The Family has altered his long-standing conservative views on marriage and is now in favor of granting controversial domestic partner privileges to homosexual couples.  The questions arise because of Dobson’s support of a “reciprocal-beneficiary contracts” bill being considered by the Colorado legislature. "," There is dispute over the proposed Colorado legislation but as far as Dr. James Dobson is concerned, no dispute about his stance on marriage.  Focus on the Family says his support of Colorado Senate Bill 166 does not reflect a change in his long-standing opposition to homosexual  marriage or domestic partnerships. The legislation was introduced by Colorado state Senator Shawn Mitchell, who is described as a conservative pro-family Republican. After Dobson announced his support of Senate Bill 166, Dr. Paul Cameron, president of the Family Research Institute in Colorado Springs, Colorado (not to be confused with the Family Research Council in Washington D.C.) called the decision “madness.” In a statement released by his office, Cameron said “The…bill is a political compromise that would provide gay and lesbian couples with many of the benefits of marriage without having to be married.”  He refers to is as “marriage-lite.”  He accused Dobson of endorsing gay rights. In a strong response to Cameron Dobson said, “I don’t know what in the world has gotten into Paul Cameron that made him make a statement like this. I’ve never endorsed any bill granting gay partners legal rights currently reserved for married couples. That is sheer nonsense.” There was also an article critical of Dobson posted briefly on the website of conservative commentator and former presidential candidate Alan Keyes.  It was written by a frequent contributor to the site at www.renewamerica.us , Andrew Longman.  After being contacted and told that Dobson was not supporting the homosexual agenda, the article was taken down and apologies posted by both Keyes and Longman. According to a 2/15/06 article on Focus On The Family’s CitizenLink web site, the Colorado legislation would streamline certain legal relationships that are already allowed under Colorado law such as powers of attorney, decisions about medical care, and administration of property after death. Dale Schowengerdt, legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund is quoted as saying that Senate Bill 166 does not give benefits based on status, such as homosexuality, which is true of civil unions and domestic partnerships. Homosexual activists don’t like the bill because it doesn’t go far enough to accomplish their goal of homosexual marriage or full domestic partnerships. Schowengerdt adds that several states have similar laws and that, in his view, they actually protect marriage. Focus on the Family says that Dobson’s support of reciprocal-beneficiary legislation is not new.  Focus supported such a bill in Hawaii in 1997 that helped protect marriage in that state from redefinition. “All this bill does is say: If you have a need to be in one of these contractual relationships with someone you legally can’t marry, you could do this through a notarized contract filed with the county clerk and — instead of paying thousands of dollars to an attorney for individual contracts — you can have one packaged contract offered to you,” the article explains. Carrie Gordon Earll, director of issues analysis for Focus on the Family Action, is quoted as saying that the bill does not advance homosexuality.  It helps a lot of people such as parents with a disabled adult child living at home, sisters sharing property, grandparents and grandchildren and many other people who would choose those closest to them to have power to fulfill legal wishes for them.  In other words, anyone who would have normally had to go through a complex and expensive process to define an important legal relationship that is not marriage. Cameron disagrees and says the bill grants homosexual couples some of the benefits currently reserved for married couples and their families and that Dobson’s endorsement of the bill advances the cause of homosexuals.

"," Tragically, this story is true. According to the Tennessee Highway Patrol, 5-year-old Maria Sue was hit in the driveway of the family home near Franklin in Williamson County, Tennessee on the evening of Wednesday, May 21, 2008.  Maria was rushed to Vanderbilt Childrens Hospital in Nashville, transported by LifeFlight, but died there of her injuries, according to the Steven Curtis Chapman web site. The driver of the vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser, was one of Maria’s teen-age brothers but neither the family nor authorities had authorized the release of his name. The Williamson County Sheriff’s department says the death appears to have been the result of an accident and that they didn’t expect any charges to be filed against the brother. Maria Sue Chapman was the youngest of six children to Steven Curtis Chapman and his wife Mary Beth.  She was also one of three adopted children. Jim House, Chapman’s manager, said that the accident happened in the midst of what was otherwise a season of rejoicing for the family.  Just a few hours earlier the Chapman’s oldest daughter, Emily, was engaged.  They were also preparing for a high school graduation party for their son Caleb.  And 10-days earlier they had celebrated Maria Sue’s 5th birthday. Chapman and his wife founded The Shaohannah’s Hope Ministry to help financially support families who wish to adopt a child.  Shaohannah is the name of the Chapman’s first adopted daughter who was brought into their home from China, which is where Maria Sue was from as well.  The ministry has provided grants to more than 1,700 families who want to adopt orphans from around the world. Chapman is a popular contemporary Christian musician with five GRAMMY Awards, 54-Dove Awards, and has sold more than 10-million albums. One of his popular songs is Cinderella , which encourages people to grab hold of special times with those whom we love.  It was inspired by a bath time for Maria and her sister, Stevery Joy, when they were not being very cooperative.  Steve tried to rush the bath but was halted by recognition of how important it was to enjoy the minutes together.  It’s part of an album titled This Moment, centered around the theme of celebrating every moment in our lives.

"," Much of this eRumor is based on the findings of Ron Wyatt, a colorful and controversial amateur archeologist who claimed to have found Noah’s ark, the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, the location of Sodom And Gomorrah, the Tower of Babel, the true site of Mt. Sinai, the true site of the crucifixion of Jesus, and the original stones of the Ten Commandments.  He was a passionate and sincere man, according to his supporters, but his critics abound and scientists and archeologists regarded him as an untrained maverick at best and there are some who regarded his as a fraud.  Wyatt died from cancer in 1999. Wyatt’s interest in the crossing of the Red Sea by the Hebrews became focused on the site of Nuweiba in Egypt because it seemed to fit some of the description of Biblical and historical accounts of the geography.  It was while diving along the beach at Nuweiba that he found what he said were chariot parts. During his first visit to Nuweiba in 1978 he found a large column lying on the beach that looked like an ancient artifact.  Later he found that it had been set up by Egyptian authorities in concrete for display.  He believed it to be a marker set up by King Solomon to note the crossing of the Red Sea. It was on that same trip in 1978 that Wyatt found what he said were the remains of chariots and chariot wheels at the bottom of the sea.  They were heavily covered with coral.  Wyatt claimed to have retrieved one of the wheels and said an Egyptian authority declared that it was from the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt, but nobody seems to know where that chariot wheel is is now located. Regarding the human bones found at the site, TruthOrFiction.com talked with Aaron Sen, one of those who has traveled to Nuweiba and who found the bones.  He said the bones were authenticated as human at Stockholm University are are in the possession of professor Lennart Moller who was at Stockholm University in the late 1990s. It was also discovered that there seems to be an underwater “bridge” of sea bed that is shallower than the depths on either side of it and that crosses from one side of the sea to the other.  Wyatt said that could have been where the waters parted and made the way for the Hebrews to cross. Wyatt’s focus on Nuweiba and his claims of finding chariot remains on the floor of the sea have brought other adventurers to the site but even Wyatt’s supporters urge caution about their enthusiastic findings.  Richard Rives, the president of Wyatt Archeological Research in Tennessee, told journalist Joe Kovacs, “All kinds of people are finding coral and calling it chariot parts.”  Wyatt’s wife, Mary Nell, told Kovacs the same.  She went diving with Wyatt at the Red Sea site and said that at first she thought everything was a chariot wheel. The bottom line is that at this point all that seems to exist to support the claims of chariot parts on the bottom of the red sea are pictures, most of which are of coral formations.  No documented artifacts have been retrieved and preserved from the site and now the Egyptian government prohibits bringing any findings to the surface to the questions may remain for a long time to come. updated 02/3308 ","Religious"

The email says that the t-shirts along with MP3 players loaded with Biblical teaching to help raise their spirits were given to them by Campus Crusade For Christ organization. "," This story is true and the T-Shirts were given to 33 trapped Chilean miners by the local branch of the International Campus Crusade for Christ, according to a statement on the ministry web site . As well as the bilingual display of gratitude saying, “Thank You Lord”, the tee shirts included an Old Testament quotation from Psalm 95:4, “In his hand are the depths of the earth, and mountain peaks belong to him.” The Campus Crusade For Christ ministry also provided each miner with an MP3 player with an audio version of the story of Jesus and audio Bible. After being trapped 2,300 below the Earth’s surface for 69 days all 33 miners were rescued. Background On August 5, 2010 a gold and copper mine in San Juan, Chile collapsed, sealing 33 miners from the outside world. The mine is located approximately 500 miles North of the Chilean capital, Santiago. After the cave in, drilling efforts began in an attempt to locate the lost minors and continued day and night.  On August 27, the 17th day of the rescue attempt, tapping on the drill was heard by the rescue team on the surface. The trapped men had managed to escape to the safety of a refuge area in the mine about 2,300 feet below the surface. When the drill was pulled back to the surface rescuers found a note attached that said, “Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33” – “We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us.” Chilean President Sebastián Piñera shows note from trapped miners The minors were trapped underground for a record breaking 69 days and spent much of their time in prayer to keep their spirits up as they waited on their rescue. .  At first, the 33 men were surviving from rationed  food and water in the refuge area.  Later a relief tube was sent down to them to replenish supplies and bring fresh air into the cramped living space which would be their home for more than two months. Computer Image of Rescue Pod Meanwhile on the surface, as the world hoped and prayed for the trapped miners, a team of engineers worked vigorously on a rescue plan to get the men safely recovered. The Chilean engineers consulted the National Aeronautical Space Administration’ (NASA) Engineering and Safety Center based at Huntsville’s Marshall Space flight Center to ensure every safety consideration would be covered in the rescue operation. Every “what if” scenario had to be examined and evaluated. The Chilean engineers sent Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to the NASA team for review for their suggestion of procedure and design modifications of the rescue pod.  The Chileans also consulted the Space Agency for nutritional guidelines and advice in maintaining a healthy mental attitude for the men who were trapped in a confined area for so long. Chief of rescue operations Andres Sougarret welcomes rescued miner Juan Illanes topside. When the news first broke that the miners were found alive the estimated time of the rescue operation was four months. On October 12th, one by one, every miner was raised to the surface.  After medical evaluation of the now freed minors and some time to be with their loved ones, many involved returned on October 17th to the scene dubbed “Campo Esperanza”- “Camp Hope” to celebrate a Thanksgiving Mass.

"," The article is real and was   released by Breitbart on May 1, 2013 . The Breitbart article said, “This regulation would severely limit   expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between   close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of   chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any   service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith   that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make   faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the   clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that   might be perceived in that fashion.” TruthOrFiction.com contacted   the Department of Defense (DoD) and Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a DoD   Spokesman, sent us this statement: “The U.S.   Department of Defense has never and will never single out a particular   religious group for persecution or prosecution. The Department makes   reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrates the religious   diversity of our service members. Service members can   share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive   attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one’s beliefs (proselytization). If a service member   harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion,   national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action   based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious   harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the   gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. The Department of   Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military   Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and   respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own   religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The   Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization,   and provides free access of religion for all members of the military   services. We work to ensure   that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right   to practice their religion — in a manner that is respectful of other   individuals’ rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that   are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from   accomplishing the military mission.” The question in any case would be exactly where does the line exist   between Evangelism and  proselytizing?   Those who preach   the Gospel often mention the Ten Commandments, if one has disobeyed a   Commandment than all Commandments have been broken and that the wages of sin   is death. That is followed by the message of salvation, that Jesus bore   the punishment for the disobedience of God’s Law and God forgives all who   believe in Jesus. Posted 05/03/13 ","Religious"

"," The story about the salvation of Bulgaria’s Jews is true but this particular version of the story has some factual problems. The information about the famous Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan is not correct.  He was not from Bulgaria.  He was born on a kibbutz in Israel and his parents were immigrants from Ukraine. Also, the book that is referenced in the story is titled Beyond Hitler’s grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria’s Jews and was written by Michael Bar-Zohar (Not Michael Bar Oar). According to Bar-Zohar, the Bulgarian government came along side of Hitler early in the war because King Boris III hoped it would help him reclaim the lost lands of Greece and Romania.  Hitler demanded that Bulgaria deport its Jews but a combination of forces in Bulgaria prevented that from happening and, according to Bar-Zohar, the Bulgarian Jews were the only Jewish population under the Nazis to actually increase during World War II. The story of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews is not a new one but there has not been agreement of what the role of King Boris III was.  Government documents about the Jews were sealed after World War II by the Communist government.  But Bar-Zohar was able to search the now opened archives and to interview Bulgarian survivors.  He says that the King did play a role along with politician Dimiter Peshev and the Metropolitan Stefen of the Bulgarian Orthodox church.  Their efforts delayed action on deporting Jews from Bulgaria long enough until the war turned against the Nazis.

It is made up of loosely-tied leather and written in Aramaic, the language of Israel during the time of Jesus Christ. The book is alleged to say that Judas Iscariot took the place of Jesus at the crucifixion. The book claims that Jesus also prophesied the coming of Muhammad. "," An ancient book was “rediscovered” in Ankara, Turkey, in 2000 after authorities captured a smuggling ring in the Mediterranean, according to a February 23, 2012, article by the National Turk news service . This rare find is a copy of the Gospel of Barnabas that has been appraised to be worth $28 million. The text does mention that Judas took the place of Jesus on the Cross and mentions Muhammad, but the book is not a bible, nor is it considered part of biblical canon. The article said the manuscript was actually written in Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, which was the native language of Jesus. Once a common language used throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, Syrian Christians in India, as well as a village near Damascus, are the remaining few who have managed to keep it alive. It is also “still used in religious rituals of Maronite Christians in Cyprus.” The original texts of all books from the the New Testament were written in Greek, not Aramaic. Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, with the exception of portions of Daniel, Ezra and one verse in Jeremiah, which were written in Aramaic. The article said that eight years after the trial of the gang of smugglers, who were “charged with smuggling antiquities, illegal excavations and the possession of explosives,” the ancient manuscript was transferred to the Ankaran Ethnography Museum. The National Turk reported, “Experts were however divided over the provenance of the manuscript, and whether it was an original, which would render it priceless, or a fake.”  The Vatican also sent a formal request to inspect the manuscript. According to a March 4, 2012,  article by Vatican Insider , a branch of  the daily newspaper La Stampa, the ”discovery is probably a hoax, the work of a forger who, according to some, could have been a European Jewish scholar from the Middle Ages.” The article said that the “most factual criticisms have come from the Syriacs,” and that those who speak modern Assyrian would not have any difficulty reading this manuscript. Language experts detected “obvious and quite significant” errors in grammar and concept that could rule out authenticity for such an ancient religious document. Today’s Bible consists of 66 books written by 40 authors and is divided into the Old and New Testaments. This version is commonly used by most Protestant denominations. The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles contains the same books, plus the deuterocanonical books. These additional books are Tobit, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, parts of Esther and parts of Daniel. The Protestants call these books the Apocrypha, which may be studied, but are not regarded as canon. There are also a group of Gnostic gospels, which are not considered part of the canon by neither Protestants nor Catholics. These are a collection of approximately 52 different texts, the most famous being the sayings of the Gospel of Thomas. According to the Moody Handbook of Theology , in order for a text to be considered canonical, there are four basic measuring criteria that must be answered: Apostolicity . Was the text written by an apostle or by someone who had a connection with one of the apostles? Acceptance . Did the church at large accept the book? Content . Had the book been accepted as orthodox teaching, and did it reflect consistency with existing doctrine? Inspiration . What was the quality of inspiration reflected by the book?

"," TruthOrFiction.com has not found any Catholic or non-Catholic historical or scholarly reference that supports this allegation.  None of the hundreds of emails or citations of this story on the net that we’ve seen includes any credible source.  Most have no source at all, but those that do most often cite an article published on the Catholic Information Network in 1995.  It was authored by Fr. Hal Stockert of Fishnetsite and appears to be the spark of the eRumor. On the other hand, there are several sources that list the song as being of probable French origin. The most notable is the prestigious New Oxford Book of Carols which not only cites the French roots of the song, but says it is based on a game that children would play on the Twelfth Night, the eve of Epiphany.  In the game, each child would have to try to remember and recite the objects that were said by a  previous child.  If successful, the child would add another object to the list for the next contestant to recite.  If not, the child dropped out.  The game would continue until there was a winner. There are also other problems with the catechism theory.   The assumption behind it is that the song allowed Catholics to secretly embrace their beliefs behind the backs of non-Catholic Christian leaders during a time when being a practicing Catholic was against the law, for example under Anglican rule.  None of the doctrines said to be represented in the Twelve Days of Christmas, however, was different from the beliefs of Anglicans or even Presbyterians.   There is also the question that if the song was that important for teaching or remembering doctrine, why was it associated only with Christmas?  One final note is that the first printed version of the song is said to be in the children’s book “Mirth Without Mischief” published in 1780 and that describes the song in similar terms as the Oxford Book of Carols.

"," 11/6/01  The       historic rally on November 4 in New Delhi featuring a mass       conversion of Hindus to Buddhism has taken place, but not in the way       that had been planned. The best article we’ve seen about the event is from Assist News       Service and David Hagen: November 5, 2001 INDIA’S DALITS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM       FROM HYPE AND OPPRESSION By:  David Hagen 4th Watch , Goshen, IN Special for Assist News Service GOSHEN, IN (ANS) — Leaders of India’s 290 million Dalits –       the “Oppressed” or “untouchables”– are leading them to       “quit Hinduism” to gain freedom and dignity. Their freedom of       religion, assembly and speech are threatened as India’s BJP       Government is pressured into dictatorial acts by its coercive       radical Hindu core constituency. This week, these tectonic struggles       have been shaking the foundations of Hinduism and India’s body       politic. In 1935, Dalit Dr. Ambedkar declared: “I was born a Hindu; I had       no choice. But I will not die a Hindu because I do have a choice.”       As Chairman of India’s Constituent Assembly, he codified freedom       of religion, legal equality and abolished caste discrimination in       India’s 1949 Constitution. (In Aug. 2001, Hindu Nepal enforced       this constitutional ban on caste discrimination.) Dr. Ambedkar found       that even constitutional rights were insufficient to ensure freedom       and dignity. On Oct. 14, 1954 he led 300,000 Dalits to leave       Hinduism and become Buddhists. Since 1997, Ram Raj, leader of India’s Dalit government workers,       has been repeating Dr. Ambedkar’s appeal, calling on Dalits to       “quit Hinduism”. There are at least three Christians for every       Buddhist in India (possibly twice that). Recognizing that not all       would become Buddhists, Ram Raj asked Buddhist, Christian and Moslem       leaders to join in giving nationwide calls for Dalits to leave       Hinduism and join non-casteist religions. Ram Raj founded the Lord Buddha Club in 1996. In       1997, he formed the “All India Confederation of SC/ST       Organizations” – “AICSSO” (“Scheduled Castes and Scheduled       Tribes” – Dalits for whom India reserves a portion of government       jobs.) In June, 2001 AICSSO leaders announced that 1 million Dalits       would quit Hinduism for Buddhism with a rally to be held on Oct. 14th,       2001. When that date for New Delhi’s Ram Lila grounds was       unavailable, the rally was rescheduled for Nov. 4th. On Sept. 7th, 749 delegates of the All India Christian       Council met in Hyderabad with Ram Raj and 25 other Dalit leaders. In       the Hyderabad Statement they declared solidarity with the Dalits and       Marginalized Sectors. Dalit leaders expressed willingness for Dalits       to become Christians. Again on Oct. 23, 700 Dalit and Christian       leaders met in Bangalore. Church leaders repented of past failures       and committed to help the Dalits. Gospel for Asia posted news of the rally plans and these events on http://www.gfa.org/revival requesting prayer and assistance.  Dr. Rochunga Pudaite, Bibles       for the World, similarly posted his expectations to speak at the       rally and distribute 1 million gospels. CBN, ChristianUnity and       other sites repeated this news. Emails multiplied calling for       prayer. However, headlines were sensationalized to “1 million to       convert to Christianity on Nov. 4th”, and “300       million on the verge of converting to Christianity” with other       false statements. Rumors grew that some 30 to 40 million would come       to New Delhi etc. The radical Hindu Sangh Parivar includes the Rahtriya Swayamsevak       Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). It accuses Christians       of forcible conversion or corrupt financial inducement (without       evidence). These charges are emphatically denied by Christian       leaders. Yet the Sangh Parivar is happy to coerce Dalits to remain       Hindu or to “reconvert”, and to “convert” tribals to       Hinduism. In fact, donations to Christian missions in India provide       India with less foreign exchange than it obtains from gurus       “converting” westerners to (Hindu) Transcendental Meditation and       so on. The threat of an avalanche of Dalits defections undermining their       privileged status galvanized the radical Hindus to a frantic effort       to cancel the event. A week before the rally, the VHP claimed a       conversion “conspiracy” by western Christian organizations under       the guise of a Buddhist event. They presented as evidence printouts       of those sensationalistic websites and emails, with reports of       truckloads of Christian literature. The Sangh Parivar (including RSS and VHP) pressured the BJP       government’s Home Minister Advani and the Delhi police to cancel       the rally. They attacked Ram Raj’s integrity as Deputy Tax       Commissioner for being on leave for four years, demanding that       Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha investigate. (Reports indicate Ram       Raj was busy establishing AICSSO, organizing its effective ’97, 98       and ‘99 rallies, organizing this 1 million “quit Hinduism”       campaign, and working on a PhD.) Claiming a Christian conspiracy, VHP President Girraj Kishore,       called for a ban on conversions of Dalit-Bahujans. After strong       condemnation, Kishore and Sangh Parivar activist Rajendra Chaddha       back tracked, claiming they were not concerned over Dalits becoming       Buddhists, but vehemently objected to their becoming Christians.       (Hindus claim Buddha as the 9th Avitar of Vishnu and       incorporate all Buddhists into Hinduism.) Ram Raj explicitly rebutted the VHP accusations. He emphasized that       he was not connected to any Christian groups. He rebutted the       “misinformation” of western websites and emails. He claimed       this was a Buddhist “re-affirmation” event with no       “conversions” (as Buddhism was an indigenous Indian religion.)       To salvage the rally and keep his core constituency, Ram Raj said       publicly that Dr. Pudaite would not be speaking and refused to let       any Christian literature be distributed. In 1992, the VHP destroyed the Babri mosque at Ayodhya. Some 3,000       Moslems were killed in the ensuing riots. Destruction of churches       and attacks on Christians under recent Indian governments have been       200 times greater than in the ‘60s and ‘70s. In 1999 radical       Hindus burned to death Australian missionary Graham Staines and his       two sons. On it’s website, the VHP called for “volunteers” to come and       disrupt the Dalit rally (private sources suggest 20,000). Citing       this, Ram Raj called on the Government to uphold the       Constitution’s freedom of religion, and protect rally       participants. This perceived threat of violence by radical Hindus was so great       that the Hindi press reported that the Dalai Lama called for the       rally to be stopped to prevent nation wide violence. (This for a       peaceful Buddhist rally that would have substantially boosted the 8       million Buddhists in India.) The National Minorities Commission also       called for the rally to be stopped, breaching its mandate to uphold       the constitutional rights of minorities. Just three days before the rally, R.S. Krishnaia, District       Commissioner of Police, revoked the rally permit granted to the       AIOCC. He claimed that “Material downloaded from the internet       clearly indicates that there is an organized attempt to use this       rally for mass scale of conversion.” This explicitly violated       India’s constitutional guarantees of the freedom to profess,       practice and propagate religion. India’s constitution requires the       Government to protect minorities’ rights, not help coerce them to       majority beliefs (i.e. fascism). Krishnaia also cited newspaper reports that 1 million would be       coming. He claimed this would exceed the capacity of the site and       threaten public safety, and that it was far above their application.       AICSSO had only registered for a “Buddhist” rally of 100,000,       not a “quit Hinduism” rally for the capacity of Ram Lila       grounds. (Time Magazine reported a “capacity” crowd of 275,000       for President Eisenhower.) However, AICSSO claims rallies of 500,000       and 800,000 to 1 million in Delhi in 1998 and 1999. Ram Raj fought back against this dictatorial Government action. He       urgently appealed to President K. R. Narayanan to intervene and       uphold democracy and the constitutional freedom of religion. He       confirmed that the rally was a Buddhist diksha ceremony and no       Christian conversions would take place. Foreign dignitaries were       invited and thousands of Dalits were already in Delhi. He said it       was too late to stop the rally at this 11th hour. Meanwhile the police dismantled the stage and positioned armed       forces to keep the Dalits out of the Ram Lila grounds. Banners were       posted declaring the event cancelled. Police imposed a de facto       state of emergency in the surrounding states, turning back massive       numbers of Dalits traveling to Delhi by bus and train. The AICSSO       claims that police kept 350,000 from reaching Delhi by force and       with reports that the rally was canceled. Dalits were barricaded into the Ambedkar Bhawan. Recommitting to       peaceful action, AICSSO leaders said: “If as the police fear,       violence breaks out, it will be the responsibility of the       government,” and: “If the police shoot, we will take the       bullets.” Denied the Ram Lila grounds, the AICSSO used the grounds       at Ambedkar Bhawan. Bhante Buddha Priya Rahul performed the sangha-diksha ceremony       (initiation into sangha. After Ram Raj was ceremonially shaved       (“tonsured”), he led those seeking Buddhist diksha to repudiate       Hinduism, and to take the 22 vows Dr. Ambedkar used in 1956. Ram Raj       then took a new Buddhist name Udit Raj. The AICSSO refused to let the radical Hindus separate them from       India’s Christians. The Buddhist rally honored and thanked senior       Christian leaders for their solidarity. Dr. Joseph D’Souza,       President, All India Christian Council, reaffirmed the Christian       community’s love for their oppressed brothers and sisters and       commitment to Dalit emancipation. Executive member Dr. K.P. Yohanan       welcomed them and committed on behalf of Gospel for Asia to bring       the light of education to the Dalits. Council Secretary General Dr.       John Dayal declared the rally a historic event that would shape       India’s future. The Dalits then moved on mass towards the Ram Lila grounds till       stopped at gunpoint by barricaded police. The tense confrontation       focused attention on the Dalits’ cause. After impassioned speeches       appealing for their constitutional rights, they finally dispersed.       Brahmin media downplayed these events claiming attendance of only       2-3000. Other observers reported that despite Government efforts       many Dalits reached the rally: cumulatively 50,000 (Times of India),       60,000 (BBC) or 100,000 (ESPL, 2 TV stations). On August 15, 2001 Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke out       against conversion: “There is a conversion motive behind the       welfare activities being carried out by some Christian missionaries       . . . and it is not proper.” He thus opposed the Constitution’s       guarantee of freedom of religion. Now his BJP Government sided with       the coercive efforts of the radical Hindus (their core       constituents). Ministers and officers actively prevented the public       exercise of India’s constitutional freedoms of religion, assembly       and speech. Others committed misprision (failure of official duties)       of negligence to uphold the Constitution. Thus both Prime Minister       and Cabinet breached their Oath of Office. On Nov. 5th, Vishal Mangalwadi threw down the gauntlet,       launching “The Quest for Freedom and Dignity: Caste, Conversion       and Cultural Revolution” in New Delhi – a manifesto for the Dalit       conversion movement. (See http://www.vishalmangalwadi.com ). The single minded efforts of Udit Raj (formerly Ram Raj) and AICSSO       to pull off this rally and see the Dalits set free from the bondage       of caste are indicators of the pent up explosive feelings against       the upper castes. The BJP Government’s coercive dictatorial       actions and abuse of Constitution may lose it the Dalit-Bahujan       (“majority”) vote and the next election. These events, Udit       Raj’s promised efforts and Mangalwadi’s book may well launch a       major civil/religious rights movement among the 290 million Dalits       and thence into India’s Bahujan (“majority”) of over 500       million “Other Backward Classes”. Private surveys and projections show that these rates of change of       belief in India from Hinduism to Christianity, Buddhism and Islam       are larger than official Government statistics. (See Operation World       2001. Details are not advertised because of the sensitivities       involved). Large numbers officially “quitting Hinduism” and the       draconian efforts to prevent them is wildfire news. It will jolt       Dalit-Bahujans into realizing they need no longer be bound by caste.       This paradigm change will catalyze even faster rates of people       leaving Hinduism. The most significant news is not these spectacular       events and headline numbers. It is these hidden but far greater       rates of change. ","Religious"

"A church leader in China has been sentenced to death-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gong/"," Gong Shengliang, the leader of the South China church, a house church group, has been sentenced to death, and the penalty could be carried out on January 5th.  Fifteen other members of the church group were also given prison sentences.  Chinese authorities say the church is a cult and that Gong was guilty of rape and “undermining the law.” "," (2/20/02) According to reports from the underground church in China, Pastor Gong’s execution has been delayed and may be appealed. There is a chance his sentence could be reduced.  Human rights observers say the visibility of the case has helped turn it around.  Authorities in China apparently hoped to sentence and execute Rev. Gong without much public attention. Gong is regarded as an influential Christian leader in China.  The South China Church was started in 1991 as an offshoot of the All Ranges Church founded by the well-know Pastor Peter Xu.  The South China Church is said to have more than 50,000 members. According to Nina Shea, a human rights expert with Freedom House in Washington, D.C., Gong was arrested in August, 2001, and sentenced to death on December 5, 2001.  Four other leaders were also given death sentences, but they were commuted, possibly setting the stage for life sentences.  One of those originally given a death penalty was Gong’s niece, 37-year-old Li Ying. Shea says the Chinese authorities issued a “top secret” report in August outlining the charges against Gong and labeling the South China church “an evil cult.”  In the document, Gong was officially accused of using a cult to undermine the enforcement of law and of malicious assault and rape.  Local Chinese Christians say the rape charges are false and have been used by Chinese authorities in the past as a part of incriminating Chinese Christian leaders.  The report of charges claims that Gong and his followers “took revenge” on the people who reported their illegal activities through beatings and throwing sulfuric acid.  The report also claims that eleven women who were also arrested said that Gong had used his position of authority to rape them.  Freedom house says that two of the women have since repudiated the rape charges and claim they were beaten by Chinese authorities to make it appear as though they had been assault victims and that the rape accusations came after they were tortured with electricity while in custody. It’s part of a crackdown on the part of Chinese authorities on “unregistered” churches.   As has been the case in previous communist countries, China has an official registered church, but numerous religious groups have refused to come under the umbrella of the government-sanctioned church. In another case, a Hong Kong businessman named Li Guangqiang has  been released from custody after originally being sentenced to 2  years in prison for smuggling thousands of Bibles into China.   He was released as a good-will gesture in connection with a visit  to China by U.S. president George W.

"," The story of a little girl who left 57-cents for a new church is true, but the version of the eRumor that is circulating has some details thrown in that are not.  The little girl’s 57-cents did inspire the efforts that resulted in the purchase of property and construction of buildings, but did not actually purchase the property outright. A first-hand account of it is in a sermon delivered December 1, 1912 by Russell H. Conwell, pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Philadelphia.  Rev. Conwell said the little girl’s name was Hattie May Wiatt.  She lived near a church where the Sunday School was very crowded and he told her that one day they would have buildings big enough to allow every one to attend who wanted to.  Later, Hattie May Wiatt became sick and died.  Rev. Conwell was asked to do the funeral and the girl’s mother told him that Hattie May had been saving money to help build a bigger church and gave him the little purse in which she had saved 57 cents.  Rev. Conwell had the 57 cents turned into 57 pennies, told the congregation the story of little Hattie May and sold the pennies for a return of about $250.  In addition, 54 of the original 57 pennies were returned to Rev. Conwell and he later put them up on display.  This was in 1886 when 57 cents was no small savings account for a little girl from a poor family.  Some of the members of the church formed what they called the Wiatt Mite Society which was dedicated to making Hattie May’s 57 cents grow as much as possible and to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school.  A house nearby was purchased with the $250 that Hattie May’s 57 cents had produced and the rest is history.  The first classes of Temple College, later Temple University, were held in that house.  It was later sold to allow Temple College to move and the growth of Temple, along with the founding of the Good Samaritan Hospital (Now the Temple University Hospital) have been powerful testimonies to Hattie May Wiatt’s dream.

"Charles Darwin became a Christian on his deathbed and renounced evolution-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/darwin/"," Charles Darwin, the author of THE SPECIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION in 1859 and the champion of evolution, renounced his evolutionary theory and became a Christian on his deathbed.  This was reported by noblewoman Lady Hope who said she visited Darwin at his home in England at the close of his life.  She described him as reading the book of Hebrews in the New Testament of the Bible.  She also said that he regarded his writings about evolution to be questions that people made into a religion.  Lady Hope said Darwin asked her to conduct a meeting outside a summer house he owned so he could hear the singing of the hymns. "," The question of whether Charles Darwin accepted Christianity and rejected evolution is an emotional and intense one.  To many Christians, Darwin is a villain who articulated a godless creation.  To others, he is a brilliant hero who led the way to an enlightened view of where we came from.  There are researchers and authors who have worked hard to prove and disprove any notion that he converted to Christianity and TruthOrFiction.com’s conclusion is that when all is said and done, there is not enough good evidence that the story is true.  We stop short of declaring it fiction, but regard it as not sufficiently proven.  The report about Darwin’s change of heart comes from one person, Lady Hope, an energetic Nineteenth Century Christian, while many members of Darwin’s family denied it and there is nothing from Darwin’s friends, colleagues, his own statements or writings to substantiate it.  If Darwin did experience something so dramatic as a conversion to Jesus Christ and a complete revision of the theory of evolution that characterized his life and work, there isn’t a shred of evidence of it outside of the claims of Lady Hope. The book THE DARWIN LEGEND by James Moore is one of the most recent and cautious analyses about the Darwin conversion story.  For many years, detractors claimed that Lady Hope either didn’t exist or never visited Darwin.  Moore demonstrates that she did indeed exist and may very well have visited him.  He also concludes, however, that her account of what happened is not reliable. A response to Moore’s book is TRUE SCIENCE AGREES WITH THE BIBLE by Malcolm Bowden.  His attention to detail is valuable reading, but in trying to argue that the conversion story may be true, he has to do a lot of speculating about what Lady Hope, Darwin, or Darwin’s family might have been thinking.

"Cassie Bernall Said “Yes” When Asked about her faith by a shooter at Columbine-Disputed!","2015-03-16 17:08:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cassie/"," Widely circulated reports and emails tell the story of high school student Cassie Bernall being a Christian martyr in the Columbine high school shootings of 1999 in Colorado.  It was reported that one of the killers asked her if she believed in God.  Cassie said, “Yes” and then was then killed. "," There     are witnesses and investigators who say that there was no verbal     exchange about God between Cassie and her killer and that it was     actually a different girl who was near Cassie who was asked about her     belief. During the days following the killings in April of 1999, several of the     students who were in the library where Cassie and others were shot said     she had been confronted by one of the gunmen, Dylan Klebold, and asked     whether she believed in God.  It was reported that she said     “yes” and was immediately shot and killed.  Her story became a spark for spiritual renewal among     many young people around the country and resulted in a best-selling book     written by her mother, Misty Bernall. On September 23, 1999, Salon magazine published an article that     questioned the story about Cassie, which was quickly followed by similar     stories in both the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post, two of the     Colorado newspapers who had followed the Columbine killings the closest. An article in the Rocky Mountain News from September 24 quotes chief     investigator John Kiekbusch of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department     as saying that the question about God may have never been asked of     Cassie.  The News says that Cassie was crouched under a table when     she was shot and that another student, 16 year old Emily Wyant, was next     to her.  Emily survived the ordeal and says she never heard Cassie     asked about belief in God.  She says Cassie was praying and saying,     “Dear God. Dear God. Why is this happening? I just want to go     home.”  In the article, Emily says she does wonder if Cassie     was singled out because of the fact that she was praying.  Klebold     reportedly looked under the table at the girls, said, “Peekaboo,”     then shot Cassie. The News article says that one of the witnesses to initially tell the     story about Cassie being asked about her belief in God was Craig Scott     whose sister Rachel was among those killed in the rampage.  He told     investigators that he heard the exchange about God and thought it was     Cassie’s voice that said “yes,” but he did not actually see     who had said it.  According to the article, Scott was later able to     point to where the gunman was at that time that he heard the exchange, but that he indicated a     table where a different student, Valeen Schnurr, had been hiding.      Schnurr’s mother says Valeen was lying wounded on the library floor and     was praying when one of the gunmen approached her and asked if she     believed in God.  The News article says she replied by saying,     “Yes, I believe in God.”  The gunman did nothing more and     Valeen survived.  The Salon article says Valeen was saying,     “Oh, my God, oh, my God, don’t let me die,” when one of the     gunmen asked her if she believed in God.  She said “yes”     and was then asked why.  She said, “Because I believe and my     parents brought me up that way.”  Salon says that in the end,     the investigators concluded that Valeen’s was the only encounter in the     library where anyone was asked about God.  None of those who     thought the question had been asked of Cassie actually witnessed it,     they only heard it and, it is suggested, heard Valeen’s voice, not     Cassie’s. The News quotes another student who was in the library during the     shootings, Joshua Lapp, as saying he is still sure of his memory of the     event and that Cassie was asked about her belief and did respond by     saying “yes” before she was shot. The editor of Misty Bernall’s book, Chris Zimmerman, says that Cassie’s     mother was candid in the book about the fact that there were differing accounts of what     was said in the library and that the crux of the book is the true story of a     troubled American teen-ager who encountered God and experienced a dramatic change that gave     her the confidence to face both her life and her death.","Religious"
"Islam in California Schools-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/byronislam/"," The message says “Public Schools Embrace Islam – A Shocker.”  It focuses on seventh graders in Byron, California, and says that although students in a growing number of public schools cannot wear crosses or utter the name of Jesus, they are being required to attend an intensive three-week course on Islam including mandated study of the tenets of Islam, the important people of Islam, wearing of a robe, adopting a Moslem name, and staging their own Jihad.  It says that the California-required course uses a textbook that says a lot more about Islam than about Christianity and quotes a teacher who says she couldn’t teach Christianity like that and can’t even say the name of Jesus in the classroom, but the seventh graders are learning how to pray to Allah. "," This eRumor has been explosive, both in terms of how quickly it grew in circulation on the Internet and the reaction it prompted. It is based on an article written for the ASSIST News Service by Austin Miles, who is described as a chaplain, author, historian, speaker, educator, and veteran master of ceremonies at various events around the country (he was a circus ringmaster). Highlighting concerns over activities in a class about Islam in Excelsior Middle School, the article suggests that the State of California has “embraced Islam,” that a course on Islam has been “stealthily” slipped into the seventh grade statewide, that the course is mandated as are activities such as wearing Islamic garb, adopting a Moslem name, and stating their own Jihad.  The article also leaves the impression that students and teachers are not allowed to utter the name of Jesus in a classroom and that students cannot wear crosses. Miles interviewed Christina Lemings, a parent of a seventh grader who is also a seventh grade teacher in the Byron Union School District in Contra Costa County, in Northern California.  She said that she did not know what was being taught in the class on Islam until her son brought home a flyer from the Excelsior School about it.  She told Miles, “they teach Islam as the true religion, and students are taught about Islam and to pray to Allah.”  The article says she has quickly learned that in public school, God and Christianity are out (forbidden) but that Islam is in. At question is what actually happened in the classes about Islam at Excelsior school and to what extent, as the article suggests, are these activities mandated statewide? If the children were taught to pray to Allah or to participate in any other Islamic devotional activities, that is an outrage deserving of the protest of parents and other concerned Californians. Lemings says there was prayer to Allah in the class.  Other news reports have said that the children were required to pray “in the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful” and to stage their own Jihad.  Nancie Castro, the principle at the middle school, denies the children were taught to pray or that any of the children was required to participate in the cultural activities of wearing Middle-Eastern clothing or choosing a Moslem name. She told the Contra Costa Times that wearing the clothing was something offered for extra credit. The American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia has written a letter to the Byron School district demanding that parents be given the chance to choose whether their children participate in the required course on Islam. Castro says that  when the flyers about the course were sent to parents, three families asked that their children be exempted from that particular portion of the studies and they were given alternate assignments. Peggy Green, the Superintendent of the Byron Union School district says that the school is merely reflecting the California guidelines for seventh grade and that the students are learning about Islam in the same way that they learn about Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and other major religions.  She says that individual teachers will augment the curriculum with various activities and games, including dressing-up and role playing, in order to stimulate class discussion.  Green did not specifically say whether there had been prayers to Allah or any other devotional activities encouraged by the teacher at Byron.  Green says she and her staff have been fielding calls and other messages to the school about the controversy, many of which have been malignant and threatening. Lemings, the teacher interviewed by Miles, says she has been troubled by the nature and content of some of the complaints to the school and issued a statement on January 15 saying, “Our schools have wonderful people teaching our children who are walking a fine line trying to comply with their state’s regulations, a vague understanding of the separation of church and state and the possibility of a lawsuit on any given day.”  She said she heard some of the recorded messages directed at her principal and school and was ashamed of them and reminded people that the protest was against decisions at the state level and that her concern was over the way the textbook had handled these issues. Educators with whom TruthOrFiction.com has spoken, however,  say that they feel that the article sensationalized the issue and included some misinformation.  It left the impression that this new class on Islam had been “slipped” into California public schools and that the state was mandating activities such as had been described as happening in the Byron School District. Forrest Turpen is  the Executive Director of the Christian Educator’s Association International (www.ceai.org).  It is a Christian group committed to educators and educational issues in public schools.  Turpin says the teaching about Islam has not been “slipped” into the curriculum.  Islam has been an important part of history, and therefore an important part of studying history for a long time and is a part of the state guidelines for seventh graders just as teaching about Christianity is a part of the educational guidelines for 6th graders.  That is the reason, according to Turpin, why the textbook “Across the Centuries” deals with Islam more than Christianity.  It’s a seventh grade text and that is the grade when Islam is studied. “In fact,” says Turpin, “the state of California has been a leader in requiring a balance of teaching about who we are and what has empowered us as a civilization.” Tom Adams, the administrator for curriculum framework at the state education department, told the Contra Costa Times that state guidelines (for seventh grade) do include a unit on Islamic civilization in the medieval world, however, it should be an academic approach on the historical significance of the religion. It should not be construed as an endorsement of it. How the guidelines are implemented in the classroom is largely up to the teacher and critics say that in many classrooms, Islam has been emphasized while other religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, have sometimes been hardly touched upon.  In an article on WorldNetDaily.com, Diana Lynne said that other parents in California have reported Islam-related activities that have caused them concern.  One parent says her daughter was indoctrinated about Islam for four months while in seventh grade in Elk Grove, California.  She said one day, she arrived at school to find a banner in front that said “There is one God, Allah, and Mohammad is his prophet.”   She says she had also seen children chanting from the Koran and praying. TruthOrFiction.com also reviewed the portions of the textbook “Across the Centuries” that deal with Islam.  The text does present Islam in a positive way, which critics say ignores some of the aspects of Islamic history that aren’t so positive, especially violent conquest. Another complaint about the text is that it treats the claims of Islam as “fact.”  TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed the disputed passages and found that most of them, with a couple of exceptions, are attributed in some way to Moslem belief, rather than stated fact.  Several of the disputed passages that are being passed around the Internet are from a section in the text that is under the umbrella title “The Teachings of Islam.”  Many of the sentences in that section have no attribution because they are already being presented as Islamic belief. There is protest from some parents about the suggested student activities in the textbook such as imaging being a Muslim soldier on the way to conquer Syria and journaling thoughts about Islam and being in battle; building a miniature mosque as a class activity; writing about a journey to Mecca; Contemplating why Islam was so attractive to Arabs and others in Southwest Asia.  One veteran teacher told TruthOrFiction.com, however, that those kinds of suggested activities are commonly used by teachers and that he doesn’t view them as being in the book in order to favor Islam.  He said that there are similar suggestions in the sixth grade textbook including having the students discuss what role the Israelite’s relationship with God played in the formation of their nation, explaining the covenant that the Israelites made with God, imagining being with the Jews when they were conquered by the Babylonians and forced into exile, discussing how Judaism and Christianity are related, how the teachings of Jesus were similar or different from those of other Jews, and doing a presentation of the differences of the religious views of the Sadducees and the Pharisees.

Billy Graham.  On an evening program, Gumbel is said to have asked why didn’t God stop the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001?  She said we’ve told God to get out of a lot of things in America, and he did, and that we need to make up our minds whether we want him or not, not just when disaster strikes. "," The interview took place on CBS’s “The Early Show” on the Thursday morning after the terrorist attacks. Jane Clayson, not Bryant Gumbel, conducted the interview with Anne Graham Lotz. According to the transcript of the broadcast, Clayson asked, “I’ve heard people say, those who are religious, those who are not, if God is good, how could God  let this happen? To that, you say?” Lotz replied, “I say God is also angry when he sees something like this. I would say also for several years now Americans in a sense have shaken their fist at God and said, God, we want you out of our schools, our government, our business, we want you out of our marketplace. And God, who is a gentleman, has just quietly backed out of our national and political life, our public life. Removing his hand of blessing and protection. We need to turn to God first of all and say, God, we’re sorry we have treated you this way and we invite you now to come into our national life. We put our trust in you. We have our trust in God on our coins, we need to practice it.” Clayson was not silent afterwards.  She proceeded to ask other questions in the interview. ","Religious"
"Tree in cemetery looks like popular images of Jesus-Truth!","2015-03-14 01:18:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/shepherdtree/"," This is an email that is short and simple, but with a link to a picture that is attracting attention…a tree in a cemetery in Illinois that seems to have an image of Jesus holding a lamb growing out of the trunk. "," Like seeing shapes in the clouds, this phenomenon depends on who is looking at it, but the tree does exist and large numbers of people say they have seen the image. The website with the picture has now been taken down, but the tree is in Calvary Cemetery in Quincy, Illinois, and has become a local tourist attraction. TruthOrFiction.com has had contact with both the cemetery and the photographer who took the pictures that are being circulated on the Internet. The photographer says his pictures are un-doctored.  Most people report that they see an image of Christ standing and holding a lamb. The image was first spotted in 1998, but officials at the cemetery were concerned about any disruption that might occur and kept it quiet for several months.  Once the word got out, however, people started coming by the hundreds and some even vandalized the tree.  It is now protected by a fence and a cemetery spokesperson says there are still daily visitors who want to see the tree. We’ve received several emails from folks asking, “How do people know it’s an image of Christ since we don’t know what Christ looked like?”  Good point.  It is more accurate to say that people are seeing what our culture has regarded as images of Christ.

"Madalyn Murray O’Hair trying to get religious programming off radio and television-Fiction!","2015-03-13 13:50:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/madelynmurrayohair/"," Email warnings say that famed Atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to take religious music and programs off radio and television.  A petition number is mentioned, RM-2493, and people are encouraged to call or write the FCC to protest the petition and urge the FCC to reject it. "," No such petition has ever been presented to the FCC by Madalyn Murray O’Hair or her organization of American atheists.  In fact, this eRumor is more than 20 years old and has produced more mail response to the FCC than anything in its history. An interesting twist is that Madalyn Murray O’Hair has been out of the picture since she disappeared in August, 1995.  In January, 2001, authorities in Texas found her remains in a shallow grave and the question then became what would happen to the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors?  We got our answer less than a month later when we started receiving versions of the rumors that began with, “THOUGH SHE’S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE. – GET THIS:”  So, it looks like the Madalyn Murray O’Hair eRumors will survive for a while. One of the reasons this FCC rumor is so believable is that Madalyn Murray O’Hair shocked the nation more than two decades ago by participating in legal action that resulted in the United States Supreme Court decision pulling prayer and Bible reading out of the classrooms in public schools. There is a petition RM-2493, but it was filed by a couple of fellows who felt that churches and religious organizations should not be operating so many FM radio frequencies that are classed as “educational.”  They asked the FCC to take several actions including freezing all new applications from religious organizations seeking educational frequencies and regulating the content of religiously operated stations.  This prompted religious broadcasters to ask for public response to the FCC on the matter and the FCC eventually issued a ruling that was favorable to the religious broadcasters. Another version of this eRumor warns that O’Hair is trying to remove references to God on the television program “Touched By an Angel.” Click here for those details. ","Religious"
