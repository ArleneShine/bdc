"Air Malaysia Pilot Resurfaces 2 Years After Flight MH370 Disappeared","2016-02-17 08:57:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/air-malaysia-pilot-resurfaces-2-years-after-flight-mh370-disappeared/"," The pilot of the Air Malaysia flight MH370 that mysteriously disappeared in March 2014 has reappeared in a hospital in Taiwan, according to viral reports "," The pilot of Air Malaysia flight MH370 did not resurface in a hospital in Taiwan nearly two years after the flight mysteriously disappeared. That rumor was started by the fake news website World News Daily Report in a story that appeared under the headline, “Taiwan: MH370 Pilot Mysteriously Resurfaces Almost 2 Years After His Flight Vanished Over China Sea.” The article (falsely) reports : Taipei| The pilot of the infamous flight MH370 of Malaysia Airlines that disappeared in March 2013, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, has mysteriously reappeared in a Taiwan hospital on Monday, suffering from severe dehydration and some type of amnesia. The 53-year-old pilot was transported at the Taipei Adventist Hospital by a couple of villagers from a nearby town. They claimed to have found the man while he was lying unconscious on the banks of the Tangshui River. He finally woke up almost 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, but couldn’t remember his name or how he arrived in Taipei. He was rapidly identified, however, thanks to his fingerprints, instantly attracting a lot of attention from the media and from various Asian governments. The disappearance of Air Malaysia flight MH370 in March 2014 has become one of the 21st century’s greatest mysteries, so it’s not surprising that the reports of the pilot’s reappearance generated a lot of interest. Within a week of being posted, the story was shared more than 16,000 times on social media. Taken out of context on social media, many readers assumed that the World News Daily Report story was true — but that’s not the case. The website’s disclaimer states that it’s “not responsible for incorrect or inaccurate information” and acknowledges the “satirical nature” of its articles. In other words, it’s a fake news website.

"Four-year-old abducted in store, hair shaved, clothes changed-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/codeadam/",".gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;} (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Four Year Old Girl Abducted in Retail Store, Hair Shaved, and Clothes Removed In A Matter of Minutes- Fiction! Summary of Rumor The writer of this email says she was standing near a mother and 4 year old girl at a Sam’s Club store when the girl suddenly disappeared.  Other versions say this happened at Mervyns’s Carrefour’s. The writer asked one of the employees to announce the missing girl over the public address system.  She says he announced a “code something,” locked all the doors, and within five minutes found the girl in a bathroom with her head shaved, most of her clothes removed, a bag of different clothes nearby along with a razor and a wig.  Somebody was trying to disguise and kidnap the girl.  The writer says that the “code” announcement was a “Code Adam” alert, named after Adam Walsh, a boy kidnapped in a department store and killed and whose father went on to create the “America’s Most Wanted” television show. "," This particular story of the four year old found in the bathroom is fiction, but the fact that children are abducted is not fiction.  According to National Center for Missing And Exploited Children, it happens more than 100,000 times each year.  Also, the “CODE ADAM” procedure for retail stores to respond to a missing child is not fiction.  It is being used by companies nationwide in North America including more than 2,500 Wal-marts and Sam’s Clubs.   Wal-mart says it pioneered the CODE ADAM idea and named it after Adam Walsh, a six-year old who was taken from a Florida mall in 1981 and was killed.  His father, John Walsh, went on to become the host of the “America’s Most Wanted” show. Store employees do not lock the doors during a CODE ADAM, but they do have procedures for spreading the word among employees about any possible missing child including a description of the child.   They also have employees at the doors watching for anything suspicious and making sure that any children who are leaving the store are accompanied by the rightful adult.  If they can’t find the child within 10 minutes, the police are called.   If they do find the child with anyone other than a parent or legal guardian, they call the police to sift out the facts.

We checked with the Philadelphia police department, Acme Markets, as well as several organizations that document cases of missing children and there was no Ashley Flores. We did find pictures on social networking sites of a girl who looked similar to the one whose picture was circulated with the eRumor and who had the name Ashley Flores.  Following those leads we were able to find the person who actually created the Ashley Flores email and get a little of the background on the story.  That was an oddity because tracking down the creators of some of the biggest eRumors is usually virtually impossible. Her name is Vickie and both she and Ashley are from Philadelphia.  Vickie told TruthOrFiction.com that it all started on Myspace.com when someone posted a bulletin about a missing girl.  Vickie thought it would be fun to replace the picture and the identifying information with that of her best friend–Ashley Flores.  Vickie said she did it with Ashley’s permission and posted it just once on Myspace.  From there it jumped to forwarded emails and the rest is history.  She said she thought that both her and Ashley’s friends would get a kick out of seeing Ashley pictured as a missing person and they all got a chuckle out of it–without realizing how big this would all get. What impact has all of this had on Ashley?  Vickie said people who had not talked with Ashley for years started contacting her or dropping by her house because of the eRumor.  The police once came to Ashley’s school inquiring about her and that was when Vickie and Ashley explained that the whole thing had been an innocent joke and that nobody was really missing.  She said the police came to seek proof of that.  Vickie told us that in preparation for furthering her education, Ashley had applied to several colleges and that she heard from some of them who thought she was now missing and were wondering what was going on.

In a classic act of Internet integrity, someone has added that she is the subject of an “Amber Alert,” a system of immediately notifying law enforcement and media of a missing child. There is no amber alert, of course, because the story is not real. Several things… 1.  There is no evidence with any missing persons organization or law enforcement agency about a girl of this age and identity. 2.  The email address given for response is no longer operating. 3.  Some versions say they are from a woman from the University of Calgary, Monzine Jang.  She is real but has nothing to do with the story and is getting weary of all the phone calls.  She doesn’t know how her name got involved.  She has been concerned enough about it, however, that she’s checked with missing persons organizations and law enforcement agencies in her area of Canada, but with no success at finding anything. 4.  Other versions say the email is from Carol R. Carreón of the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Texas at Austin.  She says she regards the email as a hoax and that it was merely forwarded to the school. 5.  Another version says she is the daughter of the manager of a Long’s Drugstore in Southern California. 6.  Still another version says she is the daughter of a store manager from Longs, South Carolina. 6.  The appeal in this eRumor is similar wording to other missing child hoaxes. 7.  If this person was really interested in getting help, she would give more information such as the location where the girl was last seen and any law enforcement agency that would want to receive any tips.
