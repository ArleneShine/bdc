"Disney’s Black Diamond VHS Tapes Are Worth Thousands-Fiction!","2016-06-06 13:59:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/disneys-black-diamond-vhs-tapes-worth-thousands/"," Blog sites have reported that Disney’s “Black Diamond” VHS tapes of movies like “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Little Mermaid” are worth tens of thousands of dollars. "," Disney’s Black Diamond VHS tapes aren’t worth tens of thousands of dollars — in fact, most aren’t even worth $10. Claims about the value of Disney’s “Black Diamond Collection” VHS tapes went viral in early June when a number of blog sites picked up false reports that VHS copies of classic Disney movies like “Beauty and the Beast” were worth thousands of dollars on resale sites like Ebay. As it turns out, however, false claims about the value of Disney’s Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes have been around for years. In early 2015, BuzzFeed reported that copies of “Beauty and the Beast” are worth $500 based solely on this one auction listed on Ebay. News Bake , a blog site that “disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy of the content” on its site, picked up the charge by mid 2016 with a story appearing under the headline, “If You Have ANY of These VHS’s, It May Be Worth Over $10,000.” The report included screen grabs of VHS copies of Disney movies like “Beauty and the Beast” listed on auction sites for as much as $10,000: Given that almost everybody has a box of old Disney VHS tapes in their basement, these reports generate a lot of buzz. However, because everybody has a box of old Disney tapes in their basement, these “Black Diamond Collection” VHS tapes are worth very little. Scammers can list items on Ebay and other online auction sites for however much they want — that doesn’t mean they’re actually worth that much. In the above screen grab, there were zero bids on both auctions for “Beauty and the Beast” VHS tapes. After filtering through all of the artificially inflated Ebay auctions for Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes, you’ll find a handful of auctions that are more fairly priced, like this one : Rumors about the value of Disney’s Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes can be traced back to a widely circulated blog posted at an Ebay community page in 2010. In the post, a Disney collector predicts that mint condition Black Diamond Collection Disney tapes will be worth money to collectors at some point in the future (like Red Line Hot Wheels Die Cast Cars and classic Barbie Dolls are today). The post does not, however, claim that Black Diamond Collection tapes are worth thousands of dollars, or even that they will be in the future: Black Diamond Tapes are easy to identify by the Black Diamond found on the Spine of the case with the Walt Disney’s Signature located inside the Diamond.  With a little hard work you can find tapes in good to mint condition.  While all of the tapes are getting hard to find in any condition the tapes are considered to be RARE in better conditions.  Because most tapes were opened and viewed till they simply wore out.  The cases also present a condition problem because of the plastic molding used to produce the cases.  The cases had a hallow space in between the plastic layers which wold crush are bend upon being dropped or having heavy pressure applied to it.  The cushioning supplied by this hallow space would help protect the tape but could make the case look beat up.  How many kids do you know that take great care of thier stuff to prevent damage.  I would say very few would have taken great care of thier movies.  So the vast majority of the Black Diamond Tapes and Cases were damaged or just simply wore out.  Plus the fact that in the early 80’s not every household had a VCR to play these tapes so far fewer of these early editions were produced..  All of this adds up to many of these tapes are now hard to find in any condition and RARE in in better conditions! Collectibles gain value when they’re extremely rare. Because Disney VHS tapes have been so widely circulated, most of them have very little monetary value now. Unopened or mint condition VHS tapes have more value, but only if you can find a serious collector. If all of this sounds familiar, it might be because it’s the exact same thing that happened with the Princess Diana Beanie Baby from the late 1990s. The value of the commemorative Beanie Baby has become wildly (and incorrectly) inflated on online auction sites. In reality, however, the Princess Diana Beanie Babies are worth anywhere from $27 to $47 ( click here for our previous report on this ). The same is true for Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes. They aren’t worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. ","Money - Financial"
"Estate Tax Rates Jump from 0 to 55% in 2016-Fiction!","2016-01-20 12:34:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/estate-tax-rates-jump-from-0-to-55-in-2016/"," It’s been rumored that estate taxes jumped from 0% to 55% on January 1, 2016. "," Federal estate tax rates didn’t jump from 0% to 55% on January 1, 2016. In fact, the vast majority of estates will pay no federal estate tax at all in 2016. The basic exclusion amount for estate taxes has risen to $5.450 million, up from $5.430 million in 2015. That means estates worth less than $5.450 million don’t pay any estate tax at all. And the claim that estate tax rates have risen couldn’t be further from the truth. In 2001, estates worth more than $675,000 were taxed at the top rate of 55%. By 2013, however, the top estate tax rate had dropped to 40%, and only estates worth more than $5.25 million were taxed. Today, 40% remains the top estate tax rate, and that only applies to estates worth more than $5.450 million, according to the Tax Foundation . Overall, the estate tax accounts for less than 1% of total federal revenue each year. In 2014, the Office of Budget Management reported that the estate tax raised $19.3 billion, about 0.6% of total federal revenue. So, reports that the estate tax rate has jumped at all — let alone from 0% to 55% — couldn’t be any more wrong. ","Money - Financial"
"2016 Tax Increases Due To Obamacare-Fiction!","2016-01-20 11:35:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/2016-tax-increases-due-to-obamacare/"," Emails warning about new tax increases taking effect on January 1, 2016, because of Obamacare have flooded inboxes and stirred panic among taxpayers. "," Claims about 2016 tax increases due to the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) are mostly fiction. An outdated and incorrect chain email that makes the rounds every January has widely circulated yet again in 2016. The email makes a number of claims about Medicare and capital gains taxes going into effect on January 1, 2016, to help fund Obamacare. We investigated those claims in 2015, and found them to be false and misleading. You can read our full coverage here . Otherwise, here’s a brief overview of each claim, and tax rates you can expect to pay in 2016: Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% : Most taxpayers will pay 1.45% in Medicare tax in 2016. Top earners ($125,000 individual/$250,000 couple) will pay a 0.9% surcharge, bringing the top Medicare tax to 2.35% , which has remained unchanged from 2013. Top income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%: The top income tax bracket in 2016 ($415,000 individual/$466,950 couple) will be 39.6%, the same as in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The rate was increased under the bipartisan American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012, not Obamacare. Top income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%: The Affordable Care Act set the top income payroll tax at 42.5% effective January 2013; however, that rate does not reflect additional state payroll taxes. Capital Gains taxes went from 15% to 28%: The maximum net capital gain tax rate is 20% in 2016, but most taxpayers pay less than that. However, a 25-28% tax rate does apply to certain types of capital gains, the IRS reports . Estate taxes went from 0 to 55%: Overall, estate tax rates have decreased over the last 15 years (the rate was 55% in 2001, and it was set at 40% in 2013). Estates of those who die in 2016 will have a basic exclusion amount of $5.450 million , up from the $5.430 million exclusion in 2015. The basic exclusion is the amount an individual can leave to heirs without paying federal estate taxes. One 2016 tax increase under Obamacare that is not included on this list is the individual mandate excise tax rate. Those who do not purchase a “qualifying” health insurance policy must pay it. The rate increased to 2.5% of adjusted gross income in 2016, up from 2% in 2015 and 1% in 2014, according to Americans for Tax Reform . The only tax levied under the Affordable Care Act that has not yet taken effect is the excise tax on comprehensive health insurance plans, otherwise known as the tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans. That’s set to take effect in January 2018. Be leery of any warnings about “new” taxes because of the Affordable Care Act before that. ","Money - Financial"
"Powerball Winners John and Lisa Robinson Giving Away Winnings-Scam!","2016-01-19 10:00:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/powerball-winners-john-and-lisa-robinson-giving-away-winnings/"," Social media posts claim that John and Lisa Robinson, co-winners of the $1.58 billion Powerball jackpot, are giving away cash to random people who like and share a website. "," Powerball winners John and Lisa Robinson don’t have any plans to share the wealth with random people who like and comment on a Facebook page. That rumor spread across social media sites shortly after the Robinsons claimed more than $500 million, their stake of the record-setting $1.58 billion Powerball jackpot in January 2016. The first clue that this was a hoax was a “people remaining” countdown tool displayed on a website linked to the offer. Despite thousands of people “redeeming” the offer, the countdown tracker continued to show that fewer than 100 people could still redeem it. Accounts from people who tried to redeem John and Lisa Robinson’s Powerball giveaway offer further prove that this is a hoax . One Facebook user shared the post and was notified that he had “won.” He was asked to click on a second link and to provide personal information to redeem his “prize.” Another commenter said he discovered that the site was recording the email addresses of those who shared the link. Another consideration is that the Robinsons have laid out plans for their winnings in media reports, and they never once mentioned sharing the wealth with perfect strangers on social media posts. Rather, the Robinsons planned to donate to their church, and to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, and said they would “help certain friends,” the Associated Press reports . If you shared the fake John and Lisa Robinson Powerball giveaway offer, you should log on from a different computer and change the email and password associated with your accounts.

"," The New American Way of Life email’s claim that there is a “perfectly legal” way to “get $75,000 in benefits for you and your girlfriend” is false. It’s illegal to receive federal benefits based on false information, and that’s exactly what this email describes. The email first talks about the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) housing choice voucher program . The program gives low-income families the ability to choose where they live and provides them vouchers to help pay rent. The email says that a landlord can legally collect housing choice voucher payments for a property that he lives in with a girlfriend so long as he has a different mailing address. That’s not true. Housing choice vouchers are issued by local housing authorities. The local authority signs a housing assistance payment contract with the landlord, and only people who are named on the lease are allowed to live there, according to the National Housing Law Project . It is illegal for anyone who isn’t named on a lease to live at one of these properties, including the landlord. The law requires local housing authorities to have policies in place to identify “unauthorized occupancy.” Those policies vary, but one common example is that a guest can’t stay for more than 14 days in a row, or for more than 20 days in a calendar year. People who receive housing choice vouchers and have unauthorized residents living in their units could face federal charges . They could also be terminated from the program . ","Money - Financial"
"List of Senior Discounts-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-04-09 18:27:44","https://www.truthorfiction.com/list-of-senior-discounts/"," A chain email includes a long list of businesses like restaurants, retailers and airlines that offer senior discounts most people don’t know about. "," Many businesses offer senior discounts, but they vary by location and often change on short notice. Some senior discounts are available only on certain days of the week, some are only available at certain times of the year, and some don’t apply to certain products. The best way for a senior to make sure they are getting every senior discount is to ask when they’re checking out, or to look on a website that allows them to search for senior discounts available in their zip code. We won’t look at every single discount listed in this chain email. But it’s very first claim, that Wendy’s offers 10% off every menu item for people older than 55, is not true. Some Wendy’s locations offer 10% off for people older than 55, others just offer a discounted price for drinks, and others don’t offer any discounts at all, according to the website SeniorDiscounts.com . Most restaurants and retailers have similar policies, so this chain email’s long list of senior discounts isn’t completely wrong — but it’s not completely right, either. And, just like the chain email claims, many airlines offer senior discounts. Southwest Airlines , American Airlines and United Airlines are among those that do. But the discounts may only apply to certain flights, or may only be valid at certain times. It’s best to check with an airline when booking your tickets.

"IRS refund checks are not what we think-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:58:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxadvance/"," An article from the Rocky       Mountain News in Colorado has gotten wide circulation on the       Internet.  The writer, David Milstead, warns that the tax       “refund” everybody thought they were receiving as a part       of a tax reform measure from Congress and President Bush is not a       refund.  It’s actually money from taxes that will be paid for       tax year 2001. "," According to the Internal Revenue Service, this is true. Here is a step-by-step explanation. 1.  Congress passed, and President Bush signed, “The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.” 2.  Among other things, it lowered taxes on your income after December 31,2000.  That means it applies to money you earned beginning in 2001 and does not apply to money you earned in 2000. 3.  Ordinarily, you would wait until 2001 is over to compute your taxes and pay them by April 15, 2002.  That would mean that if Congress gave you a tax break for your 2001 income, you would expect to benefit from it at that time. 4.  The law passed by Congress, however, gives us an “advance payment” on our 2001 taxes even before the year is over and long before the time that we would normally be computing and paying those taxes. 5.  The problem, however, is that since you are receiving the advance payment for a tax year that is not yet completed, how  does the IRS know how much your payment should be?  The answer is that the IRS is using your year 2000 tax figures to give them a clue.  They are asking, “If the lower tax rate had been in effect at that time, how much less tax would you have had to pay?”  That’s one of the reasons why not every person is receiving a check.  If you didn’t pay any taxes for 2000, you don’t get an advance check.  You may ask, “But that doesn’t seem fair because even though I didn’t pay any taxes for 2000, I know I will be for 2001, so I should get a break too.”  You are right and when you compute your taxes for 2001, that can be adjusted. 7.  When tax time does come around in April, 2002, you may look at the tax tables and notice that the tax rates don’t seem to be lower.  That’s because the advance payment check represented your tax relief for 2001.  You already got it.  If Congress gave the advance payment and lowered the tax tables too, that would be a double tax cut. updated 7/17/12 ","Money - Financial"
"Obama’s tax proposals-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxes-election/"," A forward email that lists what it says are Barack Obama’s tax proposals if he were elected president. "," This eRumor is a recycled version of one that circulated in March, 2008, about both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  It resurfaced as an Obama eRumor in July, 2008. CAPITAL GAINS, DIVIDENDS Regarding capital gains taxes, Senator Obama has talked in terms of raising capital gains taxes, perhaps as high as 28%, but that would not apply to homes.  U.S. News and World Report’s money and politics blogger James Pethokoukis said that Obama is in favor of a significant increase as part of his “Tax Fairness for the Middle Class” plan.  In an interview with CNBC in March, 2008, Obama said that he favored raising capital gains taxes from %15% to 20% but no higher than 28% Both Obama and McCain favor exempting the first $250,000 of gains from the sale of a primary residence ($500,000 for a married couple on a joint return). So to say that Obama is proposing a 28% capital gains tax on residences is incorrect. The eRumor claims that taxes on dividends would go up to 39.6%.  That is a fabricated number.  Neither candidate has ever advocated a 39.6% tax on anything.  As stated above, Obama talking in terms of raising capital gains, including dividends, to 20% and no higher than 28%. INCOME TAX The forwarded email than lists what income taxes would look like under McCain and Obama.  There is no question that the Obama Democratic proposals will result in higher taxes than McCain’s Republican proposals, but the eRumor reports erroneous numbers. The eRumor starts off giving the wrong figures for current taxes.  Here are the numbers from the eRumor compared with the actual tax rates for 2008 from the Internal Revenue Service site: Single making 30K – tax $4,500——– Actually $4,100 Single making 50K – tax $12,500—— Actually $8,845 Single making 75K – tax $18,750—— Actually $15,094 Married making 60K- tax $9,000——- Actually $8,198 Married making 75K – tax $18,750—- Actually $11,438 Married making 125K – tax $31,250– Actually $23,938 Regarding a comparison of Obama and McCain tax proposals, the Chicago Sun-Times put together its figures in June, 2008. By their estimates, for example, a person with taxable income of $19,000 or less would pay $597 less under Obama and $19 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of $19,000 to $38,000 per year would pay $892 less under Obama’s plan and $113 less under McCain’s. A person with taxable income between $112,000 and $227,000 would pay $2,300 less under Obama and $3,200 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of  $227,000 would pay $23,000 more under Obama and $15,000 less under McCain. INHERITANCE TAX The eRumor says that the inheritance tax was repealed under George W. Bush, which is not true, although there have been numerous attempts to repeal it. According to the Chicago Sun-Times article, McCain would seek to lower the inheritance tax while Obama would raise it on estates more than $3.5 million. Updated 7/18/08 ","Money - Financial"

"Claims about 2015 Tax Rates – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/2015-tax-rates/"," A forwarded email makes a number of claims about tax rate increases that take effect in 2015. "," This email makes a number of inaccurate claims   about “new” tax rate increases that were set to take effect on January   1, 2015. Another version of the chain email cited the same   tax rate increases and claimed that they were scheduled to take effect   on January 1, 2014. Both versions of the email include false and   misleading claims. Many of the tax rates listed in the email were set   under the bipartisan American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) — not the Affordable   Care Act (ACA). ATRA was passed after the 2012 presidential election to   prevent a federal government shutdown, and it took effect on January 1,   2013 — not at the beginning of 2014 or 2015, as these eRumors have   claimed. Let’s take a look at each of the email’s claims: Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% –   Fiction! The claim that this is a “new” tax increase for   2015 is false. The top Medicare tax rate was set at 2.35% in 2013.   Established under the ACA, the rate applies to high-income individuals   ($200,000/individual, $250,000/couples), the Boston Globe reports : The wage thresholds of $200,000 and $250,000    are not inflation adjusted. As such, this law will apply to more and    more taxpayers over the years. Top income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% –   Fiction! Taxpayers in the top income bracket   ($400,000/individual, $450,000/couple) won’t see an income tax increase   in 2015. The rate was set at 39.6% in 2015 , the same as in 2013 and 2014 . Top earners paid 35 percent in 2012 before the bipartisan ATRA took effect. Top income payroll tax went from 37.4% to   52.2%-Fiction! The email gets the income payroll tax rate wrong.   The rate went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent on January 1, 2013,   under the healthcare law .  However, that figure excludes state taxes that are   factored in separately. Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% –   Fiction! Capital gains taxes will not jump 13 percent in   2015. In 2012, federal capital gains taxes were 15%, which was   historically low. The rate jumped to 20 percent on January 1, 2013,   under the bipartisan ATRA. Top earners ($200,000/individual,   $250,000/couple) face an additional 2.3% increase because of ACA’s net   income surtax, Forbes reports . That leaves the federal capital gains tax rate at 23.3   percent. However, states levy additional capital gains   taxes. Overall, with state taxes factored in, the average capital gains   tax rate in 2014 was 28.7 percent, the Tax Foundation reports . The eRumor’s claim is misleading because it   excludes state capital gains taxes from the 15% figure. It also gets the   timing and the amount of the increase wrong. Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%-Fiction! This claim is false. The bipartisan ATRA capped the marginal tax rate at 20 percent on dividends income.   A Medicare tax levied under the ACA added another 3.8 percent for high-income individuals. That   means the rate will be no more than 23.8 percent. Estate tax went from 0% to 55%-Fiction! This claim is false. The maximum estate tax rate   was capped at 40 percent in both 2013 and 2014. In 2011 and 2012 it was   capped at 35 percent, the Tax Foundation reports . ","Money - Financial"

"You can make millions by transferring some money for a foreigner-Scam!","2015-03-17 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nigeriascams/"," There are numerous versions of this eRumor and they are multiplying.  They all involve a request or an offer from a foreigner that millions of dollars be allowed to pass through your bank or account and as a thanks for your help, you will receive a commission, usually 10 to 25 percent.  These emails are initially were directed at businesses and business owners but now try to appeal to anyone and there are some that are offers of donations to churches and other non-profit organizations. Also, a variation of the Nigerian Advance Fee Scam is targeting people who have merchandise for sale on the Internet (see below). "," This is one of the most common scams on the Internet right now and one of the top issues that we we receive inquiries about at TruthOrFiction.com. We’ll describe the scam in detail, but very simply, it consists of someone convincing you that a lot of money or an expensive prize is within your reach. At the last minute, however, you will be asked to advance some money to clear one last hurdle.  After that, neither the scammers nor your money are seen again. There are literally hundreds of different versions of this scam using many different names for the originator so if you may not see here the particular message that you may have received.  The bottom line is the nature of the offer made These scammers also approach victims through the mail, fax, and by telephone. According to the Secret Service, it is a scheme that predates the Internet.  It has become known as “The Nigeria Advance Fee Scam.”  It is also known as “Four-One-Nine”, referring to the Nigerian law for fraud.  The majority of the messages initially claimed to be coming from people in Africa, especially Nigeria, but now the emails seem to be coming from every part of the globe. There are several different scenarios presented in the messages. The most common one tells you that there are millions of dollars sitting idle from a business deal, a government action, or an inheritance, and all you need to do is agree to let the money be run through your bank account or to help invest it in the U.S., and you’ll get a commission, usually in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Another version of the scam targets non-profit organizations such as churches and says that a wealthy African has died and left millions of dollars to your group.  At least one U.S. church lost $90,000 to an advance-fee-crook. Other emails claim to have unclaimed cash from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 or inheritance money from a victim of the Pentagon attack on the same day. TruthOrFiction.com has also received reports from readers who responded to job ads and then were offered large amounts of money from foreigners along with the promise that than can keep a cut of it. There are also a number of reports of strange emails from foreigners who offer to buy an item for sale on the Internet.  In response to your listing to sell an expensive item such as exercise equipment, a boat, car, or airplane, you receive an email (frequently in poor English) from someone who says confidently he wants to buy it.  He asks for more information and says that he’s got either a Fedex account that can be used to send the merchandise or that he has an agent, a shipper, or someone else in the United States who will arrange for the product to be picked up and shipped.  He may even offer to pay more than your asking price and may also offer to pay with a cashier’s check or money order.  What happens, however, is that when you receive his payment, it is for several hundred or several thousand dollars more than agreed.  He explains that it was a clerical error and apologizes and asks you to simply send the difference back to him in whatever form you prefer.  Or he says that is the extra mount of money needed by his agent to arrange for the shipping and he asks that you give it to the agent when he contacts you.  His check to you, however, was bogus, but looks so real that you don’t find that out for several days.  You’ve been scammed and you can kiss the money you sent to him or his agent goodbye. It didn’t take long after the end of the war in Iraq in 2003 for a version to appear that claims to be from the former accountant of a son of Saddam Hussein. The scammers have also personally approached various professionals saying they want to build something like a medical center, sports stadium, factory, or commercial building.  The professional is eventually asked to pitch in some funds to get the project over a hurdle, and it all disappears. Watch out for people who say you’ve won contests or lotteries that you never entered, have funds for you from a transaction that you never arranged, that you have won a prize but you need to pay for the shipping, or who say they need your credit card or other financial information in order to complete the transaction. There are hundreds of other variations on those themes and, according to the U.S. Secret Service, thousands of people who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  The Secret Service receives an average of 100 phone calls and 300 to 500 pieces of correspondence per day about the advance fee scams and says that in 2001, there were reports from 2,600 Americans who said they’d been scammed.  Sixteen of them lost more than $300,000.  Many people who’ve lost money don’t report it. In August, 2006, Fox news reported that a Nigerian Advance Fee scam may have been a part of the money troubles between Tennessee minister Matthew Winkler and his wife Mary, who is accused of killing Matthew, allegedly after a heated argument about finances. The Secret Service says the approaches of the scammers may include proposals of: Disbursement of money from wills Contract fraud (C.O.D. of goods or services) Purchase of real estate Conversion of hard currency Transfer of funds from over invoiced contracts Sale of crude oil at below market prices Returning lost luggage to you that had several hundred thousand dollars cash in it. Here’s an example of what happens: 1.  You receive a request from a foreigner with the prospect of millions of dollars coming your way. 2.  You reply and through a series of exchanges via email, fax, and phone, you are presented with documentation and convincing proofs of the identities and the credentials of the people you are dealing with. 3.  You are asked to provide information about yourself or your company including letterhead, Social Security and other identification. 4.  You may be asked to come see them in person in their country, or they may ask to come see you. 5.  Very often, some strings will be pulled on your behalf such illegally getting you into the country that is your destination. 6.  Once you are feeling good about the transaction and can taste the millions of dollars in your bank account, there is a sudden complication.  You are told that the money is secure and ready to be transferred, but that in order to get it released, a government official needs to be bribed or a fee needs to be paid.  You are given a last-minute request to advance thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars to get rid of the unexpected glitch.  Or, in the worst cases, you may actually be trapped in a foreign country and will have to pay your way out.  The amount of money the scammers ask for is based on how much they’ve learned about your assets.  If they think they can get hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, that’s how much they’ll ask for.  If they know you can pay only a few thousand dollars, that’s how much they’ll ask for. 7.  You never see your money or the crooks again. One interesting note about the advance fee scams is that many of them admit that the money is stolen or the result of criminal activity such as overcharging companies who did business with the country.  That means that anyone who wants to get involved in the scheme has already agreed to participate in something that is “under the table”. That cuts down on the number of them who complain to authorities after it’s all over.  There are many wealthy individuals who would rather endure the loss of the money than to admit that they got scammed while participating in something slippery. The U.S. Secret Service says don’t respond to these communications but they’d like to hear from you if you’ve lost money to the scammers. CLICK HERE for the link.

"Democratic Origins of Social Security-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ss-origins/"," The eRumor lists several things about Social Security as it was supposed to have been instituted under the Democratic presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt: Such as: 1.  That contributions to Social Security were voluntary. 2.  That it would cost only one percent of the first $1,400 of annual income. 3.  That the contributions into Social Security would be tax deductible. 4.  That the money would go into a trust fund dedicated to Social Security and not be used to pay other federal bills. 5.  That annuity payments to retirees would not be taxed. "," Let’s take them one at a time. That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary- Fiction! According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Social Security (FICA) contribution is a payroll tax and, like all taxes, has never been voluntary. That the participants would only have to pay 1 % of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program- Fiction! SSA says the original tax rate was 1% on the employer and the employee on the first $3,000 of annual wages. That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year- Fiction! The 1935 law prevented Social Security contributions from being tax deductible and they never have been. That the money the participants put into the independent “Trust Fund” rather than into the General operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program…- Truth! This one gets a little complex. According to the SSA, the way that Social Security is financed has not changed since it was enacted in 1939. Social Security payroll taxes are deposited into The Social Security Trust Fund.  The SSA says that those funds have never been taken out and put into a “general fund.” There was an accounting change in 1968, however, that listed the Trust Fund under something called the “unified budget” along with all other federal programs. In 1990, there was another accounting change that took the Trust Fund out from under that umbrella, but according to the SSA, it was merely a matter of accounting practices, not the function of the fund itself. That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income- Fiction! There was no guarantee that Social Security payments would never be taxed. Originally, they were not taxed, but in 1983, Congress passed a law that did include Social Security payments as taxable income. posted 7/06/07 ","Money - Financial"

"The Mondex chip for the right hand and forehead-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mondex/"," This eRumor comes in various forms including a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. It describes new technology that can use tiny electronic chips to identify the person who has the chip and that it could be part of a future cashless society in which the chip would be used for financial exchanges instead of money. The eRumor also claims that the chip can be implanted into people’s bodies and that the two best places for it ware the right hand or the head.  The story hearkens to a Biblical passage in the book of Revelation that describes “The Mark of the Beast,” a system in which buying and selling can take place only with the approval of a world ruler who requires his mark to be on the right hand or forehead of every living person. "," This issue is the result of concern over small electronic chips being used in the marketplace that store bits of information on them that can be identified by using a special device that can detect and read them. An example is the “Speedpass” device that is used by Exxon and Mobil, among others, as a convenient way to make purchases.  The Speedpass is a small cylinder you can put on your key chain. When you buy gas, just wave the Speedpass in front of the pump and the gas will be automatically charged to your account.  Other retailers have experimented with Speedpass as a way of taking payment. These gizmos are known as RFID (radio frequency identification devices).  They are very small, can store information, and don’t need batteries.  When one of them comes within range of another device that can read their information, the radio transmission of the reader energizes the RFID chip so that the exchange of information can take place.  Because the chips are small and relatively inexpensive, some companies have begun using them for inventory control and as a substitute for bar codes. There is some controversy over that and demands that if the chips are used on retail items, such as clothing, that they be deactivated when sold.  The typical distance between the chips and their readers is a few inches. The PowerPoint presentation presents everything as being under the umbrella of “Mondex,” which is actually just a part of the picture, and the story focuses on so called “smart cards,” a credit card looking card that has actual cash amounts programmed into it. There is interest on the part of companies like MasterCard to see the smart card become popular but so far it is not clear how successful that is going to be. The device being described in the PowerPoint presentation that is circulating on the Internet  is the VeriChip from Applied Digital Technology which promoted it as “miniaturized, implantable, identification technology.”  It is a microchip encased in glass and is very tiny…about the size of the grain of rice.  When in the presence of a VeriChip reader, the information on the VeriChip can be retrieved.  One of the major purposes of the VeriChip would be to provide hospitals and medical teams any important information about yourself in an emergency.  The chip could tell them about your medical condition, any wishes you have regarding medical treatment, and other identifying information in case you are unconscious.  Another application is to identify children in case of kidnapping. The eRumor claims that a lot of money was spent to determine that the two best places for placement of the chip on the body are the right hand and the head.  All the VeriChip literature states, however, that the chip is to be placed in a fleshy area such as behind the upper arm.  We’ve not found any evidence that research suggested the right hand or the head. The eRumor claims that chips implanted into humans would be permanent and that there would be no way to get them out since any surgery designed to remove them would cause them to explode and contaminate their host.  One report claims that the attempted removal of the chip and the resulting explosion would cause radiation to enter the host’s body because of the chip’s lithium battery being destroyed. We have not been able to find any substantiation of that.  The VeriChip, for example, does not have a battery and is predicted to last for about 20 years after which it could easily be replaced. While the thought of having implanted chips seems to provide a lot of good things such as information for medical emergencies, tracking missing persons, and making purchases simpler, there are a lot of concerns to be overcome.  One is security.  How secure would your chip be from people you don’t want reading it? Plus, the conspiracy theorists do have a point:  Systems that have been enacted by governments for one purpose could be used for other, less honorable purposes. Does all of this have Biblical significance.  It could if governments decided to adopt the technology and make it mandatory.  At present, it’s commercial and voluntary.  But it’s always good to be reminded that a “Mark of the Beast” type system isn’t dependent on technology and could be implemented using something as simple as tattoos.

"A tax refund on 2006 forms for excise tax on long-distance phonecalls-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/exisetax/"," The IRS is offering a tax credit on 2006 tax forms for money paid in excise taxes on telephone calls. "," The eRumor is long, detailed, and complicated but it is true that on your tax forms for the 2006 tax year in the U.S. you can claim a tax credit because of a change in the collection of Federal excise taxes on telephone calls.  This is because of federal court decisions ruling that the tax no longer applies to long distance calls the way they are billed today. It applies to land-line, cellular, and even Internet calls. Here are some of the details: -Excise taxes on long-distance telephone service was halted beginning August 1, 2006. -Refunds are being offered to individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations for excise taxes paid on long-distance service between February 28, 2003 and August 1, 2006. -If you want to go to the trouble of actually assembling all the telephone bills for that period, you can do it and get a refund on the actual taxes you paid, but for convenience there is a simpler way to do it. If you claim one exemption, the refund is $30 If you claim two exemptions, the refund is $40 If you claim three exemptions, the refund is $50 If you claim four exemptions or more, the refund is $60. -You do not need to itemize deductions.  The tax credit will be offered on all individual tax forms for 2006 taxes. -For businesses and non-profits, the IRS has come up with a formula for a refund.  Check with your tax preparer for details. Historically, the long-distance excise tax was based on the time and distance of a call.  But in the 1990s more telephone companies started charging for long-distance calls without regard to distance and court challenges argued that the tax should not longer be levied.

"Detroit Loses Money on $30 Parking Tickets – Previously Truth! Now Resolved!","2015-03-17 20:38:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/detroit-loses-money-on-30-dollar-parking-tickets/"," Detroit loses $2 on each parking ticket because a parking ticket there costs $30, but it costs Detroit $32 to issue it. "," It’s true that it once cost Detroit $32 to issue a $30 parking ticket, but city officials have since increased parking ticket rates. Reports of Detroit’s parking ticket woes first surfaced in the spring of 2014. Detroit News reported : “The city is paying $32 to issue and process a $30  parking violation, and it hasn’t adjusted rates since 2001. On top  of that, about half of Detroit’s 3,404 parking meters are not  operating properly at any given time, says [Emergency Manager Kevyn] Orr’s  spokesman, Bill Nowling.” But that didn’t last for long. By April of 2014, Detroit city officials said they planned to increase parking tickets to $45. The move was expected to add $6 million in revenue each year. The parking ticket increase was included in the city’s bankruptcy disclosure settlement . The city may also take steps to fix busted parking meters and crumbling parking garages, Crain’s Detroit Business reports : “According to the bankruptcy disclosure statement, the EM is  ‘exploring a potential monetization’ of the seven parking garages  and 3,404 parking meters owned by the Automobile Parking Fund. The  APF is an enterprise fund that technically owns the infrastructure  and services the city’s parking bonds; the Parking Violations  Bureau writes the tickets and enforces the laws.” Parking has been an issue for Detroit for a long time. Unlike many other cities, Detroit has an abundance of parking garages, surface lots and meters. City planners once believed that all that parking would make it easier for people to visit the downtown area, but it’s had the opposite effect, the Washington Post reports : “Part of the problem is that all of this parking, while designed to  lure people, ultimately has the impact of making the city less worth  visiting in the first place. Why go to downtown Detroit when so much  of what you’ll find there is… parking? All of that parking, in  turn, creates a perception of safety problems. People hesitate to  park three blocks from a restaurant when that means walking past  several streets of darkly lit garages and empty lots (as opposed to  store fronts and bustling bars).” So, while Detroit has taken steps to correct its parking ticket prices, parking is still an issue for the city.

"Social Security for Illegal Immigrants who have not contributed? Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/petition-illegals/"," A couple of these are circulating, both in the form of petitions. One says that the U.S. Senate has voted to allow illegal aliens to collect on Social Security even though they have not paid into the Social Security System. Another is an internet petition originated by Californians that is to be sent to President Bush, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and several members of Congress from California.  It says that the U.S. Senate voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants and protests it..  It asks that citizenship be required for eligibility for Social Services, that no free services or funding be given to illegal immigrants, and that no college education be provided free to illegals either. "," First, Internet petitions have, so far, been of limited or no value.  They do not bear the same weight of signed petitions since anybody who wants to take the time could generate them and just make up the names.  These petitions also depend on someone to ultimately send them to the right addresses, which is not a reliable way to get them there. Second, let’s look at each of the issues in the eRumors. The Senate Vote on Social Security that generated this petition was in May, 2006. The effect of that vote was to allow language in other legislation on the issue to proceed.  It would not have granted Social Security benefits to all illegal aliens but it would have allowed illegal aliens who had already paid into Social Security to accrue the benefits of their contributions.  The Senate went on to pass a controversial immigration bill but it differed greatly from a version passed in the House of Representatives. Social Security As of this writing, Illegal immigrants are not benefiting much from Social Security.  It’s technically illegal to hire an undocumented worker so theoretically there should not be any paying into Social Security.  But because of so many illegal workers who use bogus Social Security cards to get jobs, billions of dollars of Social Security deductions are made each year as well as employer payments into Social Security on behalf of those workers. Illegals are not supposed to collect on Social Security and because their Social Security numbers are manufactured, they cannot collect so the money has become a part of the controversy over Illegal immigration.  There have been some estimates that more than $60 billion a year are being paid into the system because of illegal immigrants, money that would disappear if the immigrants did. Immigration reform being debated in Congress could affect all this such as if amnesty is granted to illegal aliens currently residing in the U.S. or if illegal aliens are given some kind of participation in the Social Security system.  There is no legislation, however, that would give illegal aliens Social Security payments if they have not paid into Social Security. Social Services Let’s look at this from the standpoint of California since that is the concern of the petition and is the state with the largest population of illegal immigrants. A wide range of services are available in California for illegal immigrants including health care and education for children. College Tuition At present in-state college tuition rates are available to undocumented immigrants as long as they meet other standards such as residency requirements.

We will post findings here if anything develops.

Hire Incentives to Restore Employment Act & Foreign Account Tax   Compliance Act H.R. 2847 , the Hire Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act is   real and was signed into law in 2010.  In this bill was tacked the   Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. This law, known as FATCA, makes U.S.   residents accountable for money invested in foreign banks by requiring   the offshore financial institutions to provide a 1099 form to the Internal Revenue Service for their American customers.    This according to a July 28, 2013 article by The Hill , a new service that reports on the   business of the U.S. Government in Washington, D.C. The article said, “ Under   FATCA, banks will be forced to submit information on total assets,   account balances, transactions, account numbers and other personal   identifying information. This intrusion goes way beyond a 1099 and would   not be accepted or tolerated by Americans living in United States. ”     Noncompliance will result in huge financial penalties and sanctions to   the foreign financial institutions. The Hill added that   neither Congress, the Internal Revenue Service nor the U.S. Department   of Treasury are certain how much FACTA will generate in terms of revenue   in taxes.   The article said that President Obama “suggested   $210 billion over ten years,” and $800 billion over the course of ten   years was projected by unnamed  “others.” It is not really known what   ramifications this law will have on U.S. residents with funds in foreign   banks or if foreign banks will cooperate with the law.

That will automatically send a message to the police that you are in trouble and they will respond to the machine.  The eRumor says that most people don’t know about this. "," The eRumor is false because there isn’t anywhere that we could find where this emergency procedure at ATM machines is actually being used. There is a seed of truth to it, however, in that the idea has been floating around for a while.  One of the biggest proponents has been in Illinois attorney named Joseph Zingher. He says the notion came to him when he was a law student at the University of Illinois and one evening was withdrawing money from an ATM in a scary part of town.  He patented his concept in 1998 and has been trying to talk banks into using it ever since. Under Zingher’s system, every ATM account would have two PIN numbers—the normal PIN used to withdraw money and what he calls the “ATM SafetyPIN” to alert police that something bad was happening at the ATM.  It has also come to be popularly called the “Panic PIN.”  The SafetyPIN would typically be the reverse of the normal PIN number or some other variation that would be easy to remember.  Legislation was passed in Illinois that would allow banks to adopt the system, but did not mandate it.  So far, no banks or financial institutions have done so.  Zingher has offered to let Illinois-based banks to use it for free but some of them have said they think it would be too expensive and that ATM crime is not frequent enough.  Zingher says that ATM crime is much higher than believed because not all crime reporting reflects whether it has taken place in connection with an ATM or forced withdrawal of cash.

"," TruthOrFiction.Com has found no evidence of any city in the U.S. dumping the dollar. This appears to be an advertising campaign to raise awareness on Bitcoin and to sell investment newsletter subscriptions .   We found such an ad on the website of political writer and commentator Dick Morris. The source of the rumor is a financial website called Money Map Press who compared the virtual currency Bitcoin to Edison’s monetary concept calling it, “Edison’s Renegade Currency.”   The advertising campaign cleverly used an unproven conspiracy theory claiming that 36 cities are switching to a monetary system based on a monetary concept of a U.S. currency backed by agricultural production of American farmers. The concept was invented by Thomas A. Edison in 1922. Many cities in the US have vendors now accepting Bitcoin for payment. So far, this is just another form of payment, such as cash, check, money order Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover.  In Newport Beach, California a Tesla automobile was purchased by a new owner using Bitcoin.  This according to a December 13, 2013 article by Money Morning.  Other well vendors are jumping on the band wagon as well.   We found a notice on the website of the online electronics vendor > that said Tiger Direct is now accepting Bitcoin. Warren Buffett quote but is it an endorsement for Bitcoin? A quote was found on top the Money Mappers page by Berkshire Hathaway’s Chairman Warren Buffett. The quote said, “People are right to fear paper money.” Such a quote may lend credibility to Money Map Press but it may not be a legitimate endorsement by Buffett, who on more than one occasion warned people to steer clear of Bitcoin. Another financial website, who may be partnered with Money Map Press, Money Morning posted a March 17, 2014 article that said Warren Buffett, warned against investing in Bitcoin and called it a “mirage.”   Buffett appeared on CNBC on March 14, 2014 and said, “Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? The idea that [Bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.” Bitcoin is beginning to be recognized by cities and states, according to a January 27, 2014 article by Bloomberg that said New York and California are “preparing to write rules of the road for entrepreneurs driving a surge of interest in Bitcoin.” Is Bitcoin a modern day version of Edison’s monetary concept? Edison’s monetary concept has nothing to do with the Internet but it may have inspired Bitcoin, according to an “infographic” posted on the Top Computer Science Degrees website . TruthOrFiction.com found a paper published on the website of the University of Washington in Seattle about the Edison proposal “that U.S. currency should be backed by the agricultural production of American farmers.” TruthorFiction.com is investigating this further and will post findings on this page when we get them.

Al Sharpton and his for-profit business interests owe $4.5 million in delinquent tax payments. "," It’s true that the Rev. Al Sharpton and his for-profit businesses owe federal and state taxes, but the amount owed is in dispute. The eRumor surfaced after the New York Times published a story in November of 2014 that claimed Sharpton and his for-profit businesses owned millions in back taxes: “Mr. Sharpton has regularly sidestepped the sorts of obligations most people see as inevitable, like taxes, rent and other bills. Records reviewed by The New York Times show more than $4.5 million in current state and federal tax liens against him and his for-profit businesses.” The Times also took aim at the finances of the National Action Network, the non-profit advocacy group headed by Sharpton. The report said the group owed more than $1 million in outstanding taxes in 2009, even as Sharpton collected a $250,000 salary. The $1 million owed by the National Action Network was not included in the reported $4.5 million owed by Sharpton and his for-profit businesses. At issue is whether or not the National Action Network failed to pay federal payroll taxes, according to Forbes : “The National Action Network kept up with the ‘growth’ by paying bills using payroll tax money: in other words, money that was collected from employees to be submitted, along with an employer contribution, to the tax authorities.” Sharpton blasted the Times report said in a press conference that outdated documents were used to make “absolutely inaccurate” claims. Sharpton said that he and the National Action Network could pay off their balances “in one day” — but couldn’t afford to pay penalties and interest on it, CNN reports : “(Sharpton said) that the $4.5 million was the original figure he was ordered to pay back in 2008, but that he has been making regular payments since then and the amount is now less.” The reports came as Sharpton took a leadership role in unrest that surfaced over the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the strangling death of Eric Gardner in New York City. Sharpton argued during the press conference that reports on his alleged back taxes could be politically motivated: “I think it’s political. A lot of people don’t like the fact that President Obama is the president. A lot of people don’t like the fact that Bill de Blasio won for mayor. And they certainly don’t like the fact that I’m still here, and I ain’t going nowhere … I have not owed a dime in current taxes or in National Action Network taxes since President Obama or de Blasio has been in office,” Sharpton said, pounding his hand for emphasis.” ","Money - Financial"

"," The story of a little girl who left 57-cents for a new church is true, but the version of the eRumor that is circulating has some details thrown in that are not.  The little girl’s 57-cents did inspire the efforts that resulted in the purchase of property and construction of buildings, but did not actually purchase the property outright. A first-hand account of it is in a sermon delivered December 1, 1912 by Russell H. Conwell, pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Philadelphia.  Rev. Conwell said the little girl’s name was Hattie May Wiatt.  She lived near a church where the Sunday School was very crowded and he told her that one day they would have buildings big enough to allow every one to attend who wanted to.  Later, Hattie May Wiatt became sick and died.  Rev. Conwell was asked to do the funeral and the girl’s mother told him that Hattie May had been saving money to help build a bigger church and gave him the little purse in which she had saved 57 cents.  Rev. Conwell had the 57 cents turned into 57 pennies, told the congregation the story of little Hattie May and sold the pennies for a return of about $250.  In addition, 54 of the original 57 pennies were returned to Rev. Conwell and he later put them up on display.  This was in 1886 when 57 cents was no small savings account for a little girl from a poor family.  Some of the members of the church formed what they called the Wiatt Mite Society which was dedicated to making Hattie May’s 57 cents grow as much as possible and to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school.  A house nearby was purchased with the $250 that Hattie May’s 57 cents had produced and the rest is history.  The first classes of Temple College, later Temple University, were held in that house.  It was later sold to allow Temple College to move and the growth of Temple, along with the founding of the Good Samaritan Hospital (Now the Temple University Hospital) have been powerful testimonies to Hattie May Wiatt’s dream.

MSNBC has compiled a look at how the various funds are doing: … SEPTEMBER 11th Fund (United Way of NYC and The New York Community Trust: Raised $337 million, has distributed $63 million. … Twin Towers Fund (Mayor Giuliani’s fund): Raised $113 million, has distributed $47 million. … Robin Hood Relief Fund (Concert of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and others): Raised $48 million, has distributed $13 million. … Victim Compensation Fund of the U.S. Government: Money will go to the injured ad families of the deceased by early next year. … SAFE HORIZON: More than $30 has been distributed to families. … ASPCA Disaster Relief Fund: More than $1.3 million raised. More than 200 animals have been saved and 300 treated. ——————————————————————————————— (11/12/01) As of this date, according to the publication “The Chronicle of Philanthropy,” 1.1 billion dollars has been raised and $204 million has been distributed through 29 charities.  The Chronicle says some charities feel that distributing the funds effectively should wait until they know what the scope of the donations is going to be.  Others are involved in controversy over accountability and deciding on who should qualify for the funds and, if so, how much. The eRumor says that a billion dollars is going to be divided by 6,000 victims, or about $167,000 per family.  In reality, the money is going to be spread more broadly.  The funds are not only for those who lost someone in death.  The Chronicle has surveyed some of the organizations and intended destinations of funds.  They include: …Support for immediate family members of firefighters, police officers, and emergency workers who died. …Help for recovery workers with financial or counseling need. …Help for families who are without income because of unemployment that resulted from the attacks. …Help for those who were injured. …Help for funeral and memorial service travel expenses for those who lost family members. …Supplies for relief workers. …Help for charities that experienced losses. …Assistance for small businesses affected. …Help for poor people affected by the attacks. …Costs for treatment of respiratory ailments for those who do not have health insurance coverage. …Support of injured police officers. Regarding the percentages being used by the charities for collecting and processing the funds, that is common. The key is for the charities to keep those administrative costs low and to be able to demonstrate to their donors that the purposes for which the funds were donated were accomplished.

"You have won the Netherlands Sweepstakes Lottery-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dutchlottery/"," You receive an email that says you have won a sweepstakes lottery in the Netherlands.  It gives you phone and fax numbers to respond to and arrange to collect your winnings, which are in the millions of dollars.  It warns you not to make any of this public ad in fact, if you breach any confidentiality, you’ll lose your winnings. "," This is a scam. It’s a variation of the “advance fee” scams that are       rampant on the Internet. Just in case anyone doubts our assessment, we have numerous versions       of this scam letter that have been sent to different people… each       with the same “winning numbers.” There are several variations of the eRumor that use different names       for the organization sponsoring the lottery, but most of them claim       to be in the Netherlands. None of those who receives these emails remembers getting into a       lottery, but hey, why not go for the money? The problem is that after you respond to the email, you’ll have one       of two exchanges that sound really authentic and then just when you       can taste the money, they’ll send you a request for you to pay them       (typically about $1,800).  They claim that it’s a processing       fee and that the lottery commission insists that it not be deducted       from your winnings.  They ask that it be sent as a Western       Union wire transfer. This is also known by other names such as “The Sunsweetin Promo       Lottery.” Once you send the money, you never hear of them or your winnings       again. If you receive this kind of eRumor or are contacted by anyone using       this approach, contact the United States Secret Service at: U.S. Secret Service Financial Crimes Division 1800 G St., NW, Room 942, Washington, DC 20223.
