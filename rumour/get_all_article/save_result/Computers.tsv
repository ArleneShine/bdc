"Latest Facebook Hack Arises Between Comments on Your Contacts’ Posts-Fiction!","2016-07-29 14:16:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/latest-facebook-hack-arises-comments-contacts-posts/"," Posts about “the latest Facebook hack” warn users that hackers are posting offensive messages or pornography “between the comments” on  contacts’ pages that appear to come from your account. "," While it’s very possible for rogue apps or malware to post offensive comments under your name, we couldn’t find any instances of this so-called “latest Facebook hack” actually happening. The post warns that hackers have been able to post offensive content between the comments on a contact’s post so that it appears to have come from your account. Even worse, the post warns, these offensive comments are impossible for you to see, which “can create hurt and misunderstandings” between you and your contacts. Again, we couldn’t find any examples of that actually happening. It’s impossible for offensive content to be posted “between the comments” unless a rogue app or malware infect your Facebook account. And, while that’s a very real threat, it’s not a “new hack” at all. Malware has been known to post content (including porn and offensive comments) with its victims’ accounts since the beginning of Facebook. Malware also tags its victims contacts in these posts to trick other people into clicking on links that will infect their devices with the same virus. If you notice unauthorized posts or comments coming from your account, immediately click the “V” dropdown icon in the upper right hand corner and remove any friends that have been tagged. Then, delete the post and check your apps to locate the source of malware. Follow these steps to remove any suspicious applications. And, if you find malware installed on your device, run a full scan with an antivirus program using these helpful tips . ","Computers"
"Pokémon Creator Admits Game is Anti-Christian, Created for Satanists-Fiction!","2016-07-13 08:51:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pokemon-creator-admits-game-anti-christian-created-satanists/"," An interview with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri in which he admits he created the game as a backlash against his Christian parents went viral amid the success of the game, Pokémon Go. "," Pokémon isn’t anti-Christian, and the game wasn’t originally created for Satanists. Those rumors started after an old, satirical interview with Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri resurfaced after the release of Pokemon Go in July 2016. The fake interview, which appeared at the video game news site Play4Real under the headline “ Pokémon Creator Admits Games are Anti-Christian, Aimed Towards Satanists,” includes excerpts from a fictional Time magazine interview : Time: What inspired you to start making the Pokémon games? Tajiri: Well, my parents were Christians. I grew up being taught the ways of that religion. When I got older, I started to realize that the things they said were foolish and I guess I rebelled a little. Time: How did you rebel? Tajiri: I started to argue against their teachings. They tried to punish me in various ways to try to get me under control, but it didn’t work. This is when I was inspired by nature and started the basis for the Pokémon games. Time: Could you explain how your parent’s religion is connected with the games? Tajiri: Well, when I got old enough, I wanted to do something that would show the world that my parents were wrong. Something I saw in nature was the concept of evolution which my parents vehemently denied existed. This sparked the idea for a game that would go against everything my parents believed in. Time: This game being Pokémon, correct? Tajiri: Yes. Pokémon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is made especially explicit in the Pokédex entries. Nature, again, played a big role. Time: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct? Tajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don’t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it. In reality, that interview never took place and Pokémon’s c reator never said the game was anti-Christian or was geared toward Satanists. He did, however, sit down for a real interview with Time Asia in 1999 and talked briefly about the game’s inspiration, which was Tajiri’s fascination with collecting bugs: TIME: Did you get the idea for Pokémon from these insects? Tajiri: Yes. Places to catch insects are rare because of urbanization. Kids play inside their homes now, and a lot had forgotten about catching insects. So had I. When I was making games, something clicked and I decided to make a game with that concept. Everything I did as a kid is kind of rolled into one–that’s what Pokémon is. Playing video games, watching TV, Ultraman with his capsule monsters–they all became ingredients for the game. Tajiri rarely gives media interviews, and we couldn’t find any evidence of him talking about Christianity or Satanism. ","Computers"
"Pandora Radio Warns that Accounts Risk Being Hacked-Truth!","2016-07-12 13:01:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pandora-radio-warns-accounts-risk-hacked/"," Many Pandora Radio users have been warned via email that their accounts are risk of being hacked. "," Pandora hasn’t been hacked, but warnings about Pandora accounts that are at risk of being hacked are very real. The threat actually circles back to a LinkedIn data breach that occurred in 2012. In May 2016, LinkedIn announced that personal data stolen from about 100 million users in the 2012 hack had been posted for sale on a “dark web” site: In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members’ passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believed were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is as a result of a new security breach. Alerts that Pandora users received about their accounts being flagged at high risk for hacking stem from the list of 100 million plus LinkedIn accounts that were hacked in 2012: Our security teams have analyzed the LinkedIn credential data and our analysis indicates that your username was among those leaked onto the Internet. This username is the same on LinkedIn and Pandora. While you have probably already changed your password on the LinkedIn website you should also change your password on any other website where you used the same password, including Pandora. Password reuse, using the same password across websites, is one way that malicious entities attempt to gain unauthorized access to services, which is why it’s important to use different passwords with different accounts. So, although the 2012 data breach didn’t directly involve Pandora, the radio streaming service crosschecked the leaked LinkedIn usernames to identify any Pandora accounts that used the same user name in order to warn listeners about an elevated threat.

"Apple Tells Windows Users to Uninstall QuickTime-Truth!","2016-04-18 18:08:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/apple-tells-windows-users-uninstall-quicktime/"," Warnings that Apple has urged Windows users to uninstall QuickTime have gone viral. "," It’s true that Apple recommended that Windows users uninstall QuickTime from their computers because of security concerns. Apple released a warning in April 2016 stating that it would no longer provide security updates for QuickTime, which leaves the software vulnerable to hackers and security threats. As such, Apple has suggested that Windows users delete QuickTime from their computers, the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team reports : Computer systems running unsupported software are exposed to elevated cybersecurity dangers, such as increased risks of malicious attacks or electronic data loss. Exploitation of QuickTime for Windows vulnerabilities could allow remote attackers to take control of affected systems. Computers running QuickTime for Windows will continue to work after support ends. However, using unsupported software may increase the risks from viruses and other security threats. Potential negative consequences include loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data, as well as damage to system resources or business assets. The only mitigation available is to uninstall QuickTime for Windows. If run Windows on an Apple computer, click here for step-by-step instructions on how to uninstall QuickTime. Warnings about QuickTime security issues on Apple computers were sparked by a Trend Micro blog post that appeared under the headline, “Urgent Call to Action: Uninstall QuickTime for Windows Today,” that reported : We’re not aware of any active attacks against these vulnerabilities currently. But the only way to protect your Windows systems from potential attacks against these or other vulnerabilities in Apple QuickTime now is to uninstall it. In this regard, QuickTime for Windows now joins Microsoft Windows XP and Oracle Java 6 as software that is no longer being updated to fix vulnerabilities and subject to ever increasing risk as more and more unpatched vulnerabilities are found affecting it. So, warnings urging Apple users running Windows to uninstall QuickTime due to security vulnerabilities are true. However, we aren’t aware of any specific threats or viruses that are affecting computers as a result of this — yet. ","Computers"

"," You can’t use the phrase “soflo” to unlock iPhones without the password. That rumor started with a viral video posted on Facebook.

Tech Harp pointed out in this video that SoFlo simply used the iPhone’s touch ID to unlock his iPhone at the beginning of the video. Then, after his phone was unlocked, SoFlo went through a series of pointless steps to make it appear that he’d bypassed the passkey by the end. This isn’t the first time SoFlo has given bad iPhone advice, either.

"Turbo Clean PC Free Download Offer-Virus!","2016-01-26 13:12:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/turbo-clean-pc-free-download-offer/"," A so-called “PC Optimizer” called Turbo Clean PC offers a free download that can supposedly boost the speed of your computer by eliminating errors and helping it to operate cleanly. "," Whether or not Turbo Clean PC can actually help your computer run faster is open for debate, but downloading it can definitely damage your computer, and the “free download” offer is misleading at best. First, Turbo Clean PC downloads are often packaged with harmful malware installers that can harm your computer and encrypt your data. Second, the “free download” will only scan your operating system; you’ll have to pay for the full download to fix any problems. Third, there’s evidence that Turbo Clean PC won’t actually help your computer run faster at all. Let’s take a step back and look at Rainmaker Software Group, Turbo Clean PC’s Delaware-based developer. The company released an earlier PC optimizer called Pro PC Cleaner that has been widely described as adware and malware. Symantec Corporation describes Pro PC Cleaner as “a misleading application (rogue software) designed to display false information, such as claiming your system is infected with malicious threats or other system errors” to get users to buy unneeded software to remove threats that don’t exist. Entering “Pro PC Cleaner” into Google returns nothing but customer complaints and instructions to remove it from computers. That might be why Rainmaker Software Group shifted its focus to a similar application with a different name, Turbo Clean PC. Once you download the free version of Turbo Clean PC, it will scan your operating system and compile a lengthy list of system errors and threats. The blog site Spyware-Techie investigated and found that the list of threats and errors are “misleading and suspicious.” It includes temporary files, folders and register entries that “do not affect your operating system in any way.” But, in order to fix the so-called errors, you’ll be prompted to buy the full version of Turbo Clean PC. Spyware-Technie also notes that Turbo Clean PC is often spread through bundled installers, which pose serious malware threats: Such means of distribution are often used by malware developers to spread their intrusive software; thus, there is a chance that your PC could be already infected with some other malicious program if this questionable application is already operating on your computer. Make sure to check the %APPDATA% folder for any dubious files or folders as this directory is known to be used by malicious software most often. Also, you should analyze your registry system for any questionable keys or values. To avoid such potentially harmful instance, you should avoid all third-party download websites as they are well-known to provide setup files filled with suspicious software. Also, you should always have a professional antimalware tool active on your PC at all times as it can notify you about any suspicious installers or websites in advanced. VirusResearch.org stopped short of saying that Turbo Clean PC does not work at all, or that it will damage your computer if it’s downloaded directly from the developer. The site did, however, note that four reputable anti-virus engines have flagged Turbo Clean PC as a threat. Given all that, we’re going to classify this one as a virus. It’s best to avoid downloading the program all together, but if you already have, click here for instructions on how to uninstall it. ","Computers"
"Shred Your Airline Boarding Passes-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-01-22 11:31:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/shred-your-airline-boarding-passes/"," Airline travelers have been told to shred their boarding passes because scammers can retrieve personal information by scanning a barcode. "," Bar codes on boarding passes do contain personal information, but not much more than is already printed on your boarding pass in plain text. Calls for airline travelers to shred their boarding passes emerged in October 2015. That’s when security blogger Brian Krebs published a blog post headlined, “What’s in a Board Pass Barcode? A lot,” at KrebsonSecurity.com : The next time you’re thinking of throwing away a used boarding pass with a barcode on it, consider tossing the boarding pass into a document shredder instead. Two-dimensional barcodes and QR codes can hold a great deal of information, and the codes printed on airline boarding passes may allow someone to discover more about you, your future travel plans, and your frequent flyer account. Earlier this year, I heard from a longtime KrebsOnSecurity reader named Cory who said he began to get curious about the data stored inside a boarding pass barcode after a friend put a picture of his boarding pass up on Facebook. Cory took a screen shot of the boarding pass, enlarged it, and quickly found a site online that could read the data. “I found a website that could decode the data and instantly had lots of info about his trip,” Cory said, showing this author step-by-step exactly how he was able to find this information. Krebs wrote that the reader was able to retrieve the passenger’s name, frequent flier number and a “record key” for the Lufthansa flight. Then, with the record key, the reader was supposedly able to gain access to the traveler’s entire account and could have changed passwords and pin numbers. That’s where the threat of boarding pas security gets murky, however. To gain access to a secured account, you need to enter a pre-set password and pin number, or answer security questions to reset them. That info isn’t in a boarding pass barcode. In Krebs example, the hacker knew his “victim” and knew the answer to the security question, “What’s your mother’s maiden name?” More often than not, that wouldn’t be the case. Also, Brian Salzman, the VP of marketing for Inlite Research, the company that makes the online scanner cited by Krebs, said barcodes don’t have much more information that is already printed on the boarding pass, Fusion reports : I also reached out to Inlite Research, the company that put the free barcode scanner online that Krebs pointed people to. The site got a surge of traffic last week said Michael Salzman, Inlite’s VP of Marketing. He was nonplussed by the privacy freak-out. “Isn’t most of that information on the boarding pass itself?” Salzman said. “Barcodes are not inherently secure or insecure. Barcodes are a dumb way to package information into an image. The nature of the information is up to the people who use it.” Fusion reporter Kashmir Hill scanned boarding passes from many different airlines and found in all cases that the frequent flier number was the only bit of personal information not already printed on the ticket. Boarding pass barcodes have been in wide use since 2005. That year, the International Air Transport Association undertook a five-year long project to establish Bar Coded Boarding Passes (BCBP) in all of its member airlines . Tech blogger Shaun Ewing delved into the science of BCBP and outlined exactly what information is “hidden” inside boarding pass barcodes on at his blog site, Shaun.net : EWING/SHAUN: My name. E1AAAAA: Electronic ticket indicator and my booking reference. SYDBNEQF: Flying from SYD (Sydney) to BNE (Brisbane) on QF (Qantas). 0524: Flight number 524. 106: The Julian date. In this case 106 is April 16. Y: Cabin – Economy in this case. Others including F (First) and J (Business). 23A: My seat. 0073: My sequence number. In this case I was the 73rd person to check-in. 3: My “passenger status”. 59: There is a various size field. This is the size >: Beginning of the version number 2: The version number. 18: Field size of another variable field. 0: My check-in source. B: Airline designator of boarding pass issuer. 2: Another variable size field. 9: Airline code. 0: International document verification. ’0′ as I presume is not applicable. QF: The airline my frequent flyer account is with. 1245678: My frequent flyer number. 128: Airline specific data. Ewing found that the barcode information was “harmless,” but he advised against leaving boarding passes behind in seat pockets or posting photos of them online. To summarize, it’s true that there’s information in boarding pass barcodes, but the threat level has been overblown. And, no, you don’t need to shred your boarding passes. ","Computers"
"Video Shows Hologram Whale Jumping in Gymnasium-Fiction!","2016-01-14 10:13:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/video-shows-hologram-whale-jumping-in-gymnasium/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Video Shows Hologram Whale Jumping in Gymnasium- Fiction! Summary of eRummor: Many are wondering if a video showing a humpback whale hologram jumping through a gymnasium floor as students look on is real. "," This is a promotional video for a tech startup that shows what type of technology they want to develop, not what they’re currently able to do. In other words, a hologram whale didn’t really jump through a gymnasium floor as amazed children looked on — the video was edited to showcase the technology the company, Magic Leap, hopes to develop. As of October 2015, Magic Leap was in “stealth mode.” The company had attracted high-profile investors like Google and Weta Workshop, the company that did special effects for “Lord of the Rings” and “Avatar.” Still, Magic Leap’s technology has been largely held under wraps, CNET reports : According to Magic Leap, the graphics you see while using it will look movie-like. It seems as though virtual objects won’t overlap with real-world ones, and they’ll create virtual interactions with real things (like the virtual reflections off a real table). HoloLens also recognizes things around you, such as walls or tables, or your hands: some games blast virtual holes in walls, too, but demos I’ve tried so far have been under extremely locked down conditions. Magic Leap claims these mixed-reality things will appear around you in everyday use, and will seem indistinguishable from reality. That’s something that no one has achieved, and I’d have to see to believe. Magic Leap released a video that it says was shot directly through its technology without any special effects or editing in October 2015. The video shows what appear to be holograms interacting with the physical world, but it’s nowhere near the size and scale of the humpback whale jumping through a gymnasium floor. So, this one could be true someday, but it’s fiction for now. ","Computers"
"The New Apple iOS 9 WiFi Assist Feature Boosts Data Usage-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-09-30 13:44:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-new-apple-ios-9-wifi-assist-feature-boosts-data-usage/"," Apple’s new iOS 9 has a WiFi Assist feature that eats up data plans. "," It’s true that the Apple iOS 9 WiFi Assist feature leads to more data plan usage, but some accounts of how much more data the feature uses have been exaggerated. Released in September 2015, iOS 9 came with new features, including WiFi Assist. WiFi Assist detects weak wireless Internet connections and automatically switches over to the user’s data network to prevent buffering or slow browsing speeds. The notion that the iOS 9 WiFi Assist feature leads to more data plan useage started after the website Quartz published a story headlined, “You might want to turn off this new iOS 9 setting if you don’t have unlimited data”: The new setting, which is automatically turned on when a phone is updated to iOS 9, attempts to ensure that users don’t experience any buffering when on a weak WiFi signal. The iPhone will detect when a WiFi signal lacks strength, and switch over to a cellular connection. This is great for when you’re stuck in places like the connectivity nexus right outside your home, where old iPhones would cling to the WiFi signal for as long as possible, but wouldn’t actually be able to load anything. But there is a cost: The switch to cellular could mean you’re using more data from your monthly plan—potentially significantly more than you’re accustomed to using. Rumors about iOS 9 WiFi Assist gained even more traction after a Gizmodo reviewer reported that his mobile data usage had increased by a third since he had upgraded to iOS 9: I’ve been using Wi-Fi Assist on my iPhone for a few months; even despite knowing what to look for (a greyed-out Wi-Fi icon), I haven’t really noticed it in action. But it has been showing up in my cell data usage: since downloading the iOS 9 beta that introduced Wi-Fi assist, I’ve used around a third more data a month (4GB vs my regular-as-clockwork 3GB). It’s impossible to say if that extra usage is directly related to Wi-Fi Assist, but I have my suspicions. On the iPhone 6s that I’ve only been using for three days, my data usage is at 950MB; half of that is from Netflix, which I make certain to never use when I’m on the go. In fact, the only time I’ve used it in the past couple days was at home, using what I thought was Wi-Fi. After it was established that the WiFi Assist feature leads to more data usage, the story quickly jumped the rails. The website Distractify reported that WiFI Assist was costing users “hundreds of dollars” and showed an image of a $17,148 phone bill (the bill was dated 2010 and unrelated to the story). Claims that WiFi Assist costs users hundreds of dollars or “devours” data plans (as CBS News reported ) are false and misleading. How much more data usage WiFi Assist leads to depends on individual mobile browsing habits. But since the feature only kicks on when there’s a weak wireless connection, your data usage probably won’t change much — unless you regularly use a weak wireless connection to stream movies. WiFi Assist can easily be turned off, too. Just open “Settings,” select “Cellular” and un-select “WiFi Assist.” ","Computers"

Microsoft launched Windows 10 in July 2015, and it was made available as a free upgrade to customers who previously purchased Windows 7 or Windows 8. With millions of users wanting the free upgrade, however, Microsoft set up a waiting list to help it manage all those software downloads, PC World reports : On Friday, Microsoft sent out an email to users who signed up to reserve their copy of Windows 10.

"Samsung Phone Batteries Have a Spy Chip-Fiction!","2015-06-24 09:19:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/samsung-phone-batteries-have-a-spy-chip/"," Some people have questioned whether Samsung mobile phone batteries are equipped with a spy chip that lets the company track phone usage. "," Samsung batteries don’t have a spy chip, but that doesn’t mean phone usage can’t be tracked. The rumor about the Samsung battery spy chip started on a WhatsApp message board. A user posted photos of a Samsung battery with the wrapper removed. It had what appeared to be a plastic chip with circuits attached to it. The post quickly led users to question whether it was a spy chip: “Yesterday I saw an WhatsApp message in that one person showing the Samsung phone batteries He remove the rapper and take out the black color thin paper or plastic sheet which is attached with the body of the battery and there is some lines on that like a circuit and he claimed that, This is a kind of chip to spy our daily use of mobile phone is it true? Please answer me I am so confused.” The question made its way to a forum for Samsung developers , and they quickly shot down the idea that spy chips are attached to Samsung batteries. Rather, they explained, it’s what’s called a Near Field Communication (NFC) antenna. It allows phones to share information at short distances, like making a transaction using Google Wallet or “bumping” phones to share a contact. But that doesn’t mean your phone usage and browsing data are secure. Cell phone providers routinely sell subscribers’ search and browsing history to advertisers. AT&T made waves in March 2015 when it unrolled a plan that promised privacy to subscribers for an additional $29 per month. There are a number of ways to adjust your phone’s security settings to manage how your usage information is collected and shared with advertisers, USA Today reports : iPhone If you’re an iPhone user, you need to go into Settings, and then tap Privacy. Scroll all the way down to Advertising. You’ll see a button labeled says, “Limit ad tracking.” If it’s not showing a green color, slide the button so that it shows green. This will stop ad companies from tracking what you do with your phone and serving up targeted ads. Right underneath that setting, by the way, you’ll see the “Reset Advertising Identifier” option. Tapping on that will zero out the anonymized identifier linked to your personal data on Apple’s servers. In other words, to trackers you’ll appear to be a new user. This can make it more difficult (but not impossible) for advertisers to build up a profile on how you browse. Android To turn off the Google “AdID” system, you don’t go to your Android phone settings, but your Google Settings app. You might have to look under your full list of apps to find it. Once you’re in Google Settings, tap the Ads link and then tap “Opt out of interest-based ads.” You can also see your advertising ID and tap “Reset advertising ID” to make a new one. This will make you look like a new user to advertisers. Ads aren’t the only way you’re tracked on your phone. Google and Apple might be tracking your searches. Use this search app instead to make private searches. Windows Phone To turn off Personalized ads in Windows Phone, go to Microsoft’s ad opt-out page and under “Personalize ads whenever I use my Microsoft account” click “Off.” You will need to be signed in with a Windows account to do this.

"Create an entry in your address book to avoid spreading viruses-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/virustip/"," This message includes a tip to help avoid spreading viruses.  Since many viruses automatically email themselves to people in your address book, create a new entry that will foil the attempt.  Give the new entry the name of !0000 or AAAAAA and do not put any email address in the entry.   That way it will be the first in the address book. When a virus tries to send itself to every address, it won’t get very far because the familiar error message will appear that says it could not be sent because of either a missing email address or a bad address. "," The virus experts we have checked with say this piece of simplistic advice did not come from anyone who knows about viruses and that it should not be relied upon.  Many viruses will send themselves to any valid email addresses that are found in the address book regardless of whether there are also invalid entries. Many computer owners have tested the “!0000” suggestion by creating an email that is addressed to several recipients, including the “!0000” entry.  The progress of the email will be halted because one of the intended recipients does not have a valid address.  Self-propagating viruses, however, do not normally create a single email to a group of recipients that is halted if one of the email addresses is invalid.  They create individual emails that are sent to one recipient at a time…therefore all the valid email addresses do receive the virus. Also, some viruses such as the “SirCam” virus have their own email software included so they will not be using your email program or hindered by any of it’s error detection or messages.

"“The Beast,” a supercomputer in Belgium with every person on earth in it-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:57:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beastofbelgium/"," A three-story computer in Brussels, Belgium called “The Beast,” is described as being the brain-child of the European Common Market.  It is said to be “self programming” and is intended to track the buying and selling activities of every person on earth.  Additionally, the system is alleged to depend on invisible tattoos on the forehead or back of the hand of each person for identity purposes.  Ominously, the tattoo will be of a unique, personalized number composed of three entries of three digits each. "," It’s easy to see how this story would grab the attention of Christians. It’s almost as though it were tailor-made to fit with the book of Revelation. And… it was. Unlike most urban legends, we have a clear trail that leads to where the story came from. There are various printed versions of the story that date back to 1973, but the most widely circulated early account appeared in Christian Life magazine in August 1976. Three months after publishing the story, Christian Life received a letter from Christian author Joe Musser. In it, he explained that the Beast Computer of Belgium did not exist in reality, but in fantasy. Musser said that he created the scenario for a novel he wrote, titled Beyond a Pale Horse, and for a screenplay for the David Wilkerson film, The Rapture . In the letter, Musser said that for three years he had seen the story he had created being passed along as fact. The possibility for confusing fiction with fact was there from the outset. As a part of the promotion for the David Wilkerson film, some mock newspapers had been printed which had convincing-looking news stories about events that could be associated with the rapture, including the Beast Computer of Belgium. Unless one read the small print next to the copyright notice, there was nothing to indicate that it was fiction. As with other urban legends, some thoughtful evaluation of the facts would cast doubt on the story. For example, anybody who is savvy enough about computers would know that it’s not going to take a computer occupying three stories of a major building to catalog all the people on the earth. Today’s computers can handle the task in a fraction of that space – assuming there was some way to know who all the people were. Also, some versions of the story stated that the computer was self-programming, suggesting that perhaps it had a life of its own outside of the humans who programmed it. Artificial intelligence is a fascinating subject, and computers are getting smarter every day, but no computer expert that I know of is worried about whether a database program could become the Antichrist. Additionally, even if a decision were made to track all humans, it is not clear that the European Common Market would be the entity to initiate or control it. ","Computers"

"Hidden code in Microsoft Windows says Bill Gates is the Anti-Christ-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/billgates-hm/"," This email talks suspiciously about the success of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.  It also says that the ASCII code numbers for his name add up to “666,” a significant number in the book of Revelation in the Bible related to a leader that will rise to power at the close of human history.  It also talks about a sinister-looking and hidden program in Windows that, the writer claims, can be used by Bill Gates to control the world. "," This email is a hoax. 1.  It talks about the fact that the name, “Bill Gates III” adds up to “666” in ASCII code.  Let’s start there.  (This may get a little complex).  Every letter, number, and symbol on a computer has a corresponding numerical ASCII code.  It’s not only the way a computer communicates behind the scenes, but a standardized way that computers can speak the same language to each another.  Also, each letter or number on the keyboard has two different versions of the ASCII code, one called a decimal code and one called a hexadecimal equivalent.  For a capital “A”, for example, the ASCII decimal is 65 and the hexadecimal equivalent is 41.  In the email, all the ASCII codes for “Bill Gates” are correct if you use the decimal ASCII codes for capital letters.  When it comes to “III”, however, nothing adds up.  The email claims that the ASCII code for each of characters in “III” is 1, but that is not the case.  If you use lower case “L” for the “III”, the decimal ASCII code is 108.  If you use upper case “i”, the decimal code is 73.  If you use the number “1”, the decimal code is 49.  There isn’t any instance in the ASCII code in which any of the visible letters or numerals that would be used for “III” has a decimal or hexadecimal number that equates to “1.” 2.  The writer of the email tries to emphasize the point by saying that if you go to Windows 95 or MS-DOS, you’ll get the same result.  That’s meaningless because the ASCII code is a standardized one and is the same on each computer that uses it.  There is not one ASCII code for Windows 95, then another for Windows 98, then another for the various version of MS-DOS. 3.  Regarding THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS, there is nothing sinister about it and it has nothing to do with Bill Gates or Microsoft controlling any other computers, much more the U.S. nuclear arsenal.  The HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is what’s known among computer buffs as an “Easter Egg.”  Software programmers routinely include fun stuff in their programs that is hidden from normal view.  That’s why they’re called “Easter Eggs,” because they are hidden and you have to find them.  One website that catalogs Easter Eggs has accumulated a list of nearly four thousand of them in thousands of different software programs.  Some of them are humorous pictures.  Others are clever games.  Many Easter Eggs display a list of all of the names of programmers who created the program.  THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is a game of sorts that the programmers included in Microsoft Excel 95.  It results in your finding a list of the creators as well as some pictures.

"Popular Mechanics photo from 1954 predicting the look of the home computer in 2004-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/randpix/"," A picture of a man standing in front of a large electronic contraption. The eRumor claims that it’s a picture from a 1954 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine. The caption says that scientists from the RAND Corporation put together a model to illustrate how a “home computer” could look in the year 2004. "," According to an article on the Popular Mechanics website, the picture is a hoax. The picture was actually created by a man named Troels Eklund Andersen, a Danish tech support technician. He started with a picture of a mock submarine maneuvering room, added an old TV handing from the wall, a 1970’s teletype, and threw in a picture of a hardware store owner from Ohio. He entered the picture in a photo manipulation contest. He never intended for it to be treated as a real picture. According to Popular Mechanics, those who have been hoodwinked by the picture include some people who should have known better. Scott Mcnealy of Sun Microsystems used the picture in his Oracle OpenWorld keynote speech in December, 2004 in San Francisco and Lotus founder Mitch Kapor briefly had it posed on his blog.

"The Mondex chip for the right hand and forehead-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mondex/"," This eRumor comes in various forms including a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation. It describes new technology that can use tiny electronic chips to identify the person who has the chip and that it could be part of a future cashless society in which the chip would be used for financial exchanges instead of money. The eRumor also claims that the chip can be implanted into people’s bodies and that the two best places for it ware the right hand or the head.  The story hearkens to a Biblical passage in the book of Revelation that describes “The Mark of the Beast,” a system in which buying and selling can take place only with the approval of a world ruler who requires his mark to be on the right hand or forehead of every living person. "," This issue is the result of concern over small electronic chips being used in the marketplace that store bits of information on them that can be identified by using a special device that can detect and read them. An example is the “Speedpass” device that is used by Exxon and Mobil, among others, as a convenient way to make purchases.  The Speedpass is a small cylinder you can put on your key chain. When you buy gas, just wave the Speedpass in front of the pump and the gas will be automatically charged to your account.  Other retailers have experimented with Speedpass as a way of taking payment. These gizmos are known as RFID (radio frequency identification devices).  They are very small, can store information, and don’t need batteries.  When one of them comes within range of another device that can read their information, the radio transmission of the reader energizes the RFID chip so that the exchange of information can take place.  Because the chips are small and relatively inexpensive, some companies have begun using them for inventory control and as a substitute for bar codes. There is some controversy over that and demands that if the chips are used on retail items, such as clothing, that they be deactivated when sold.  The typical distance between the chips and their readers is a few inches. The PowerPoint presentation presents everything as being under the umbrella of “Mondex,” which is actually just a part of the picture, and the story focuses on so called “smart cards,” a credit card looking card that has actual cash amounts programmed into it. There is interest on the part of companies like MasterCard to see the smart card become popular but so far it is not clear how successful that is going to be. The device being described in the PowerPoint presentation that is circulating on the Internet  is the VeriChip from Applied Digital Technology which promoted it as “miniaturized, implantable, identification technology.”  It is a microchip encased in glass and is very tiny…about the size of the grain of rice.  When in the presence of a VeriChip reader, the information on the VeriChip can be retrieved.  One of the major purposes of the VeriChip would be to provide hospitals and medical teams any important information about yourself in an emergency.  The chip could tell them about your medical condition, any wishes you have regarding medical treatment, and other identifying information in case you are unconscious.  Another application is to identify children in case of kidnapping. The eRumor claims that a lot of money was spent to determine that the two best places for placement of the chip on the body are the right hand and the head.  All the VeriChip literature states, however, that the chip is to be placed in a fleshy area such as behind the upper arm.  We’ve not found any evidence that research suggested the right hand or the head. The eRumor claims that chips implanted into humans would be permanent and that there would be no way to get them out since any surgery designed to remove them would cause them to explode and contaminate their host.  One report claims that the attempted removal of the chip and the resulting explosion would cause radiation to enter the host’s body because of the chip’s lithium battery being destroyed. We have not been able to find any substantiation of that.  The VeriChip, for example, does not have a battery and is predicted to last for about 20 years after which it could easily be replaced. While the thought of having implanted chips seems to provide a lot of good things such as information for medical emergencies, tracking missing persons, and making purchases simpler, there are a lot of concerns to be overcome.  One is security.  How secure would your chip be from people you don’t want reading it? Plus, the conspiracy theorists do have a point:  Systems that have been enacted by governments for one purpose could be used for other, less honorable purposes. Does all of this have Biblical significance.  It could if governments decided to adopt the technology and make it mandatory.  At present, it’s commercial and voluntary.  But it’s always good to be reminded that a “Mark of the Beast” type system isn’t dependent on technology and could be implemented using something as simple as tattoos.

"," This is one of those eRumors that focuses on a non-sinister feature of the Internet and makes it sound sinister.  We have not been able to find any evidence that any law enforcement agency has issued any warnings about the Google search for phone numbers. Google.com is one of the most versatile search engines on the Internet.  One of the features built into Google is the ability to conveniently look up information from the White Pages of any telephone book.  If you type a name, address, and city of a person with a listed phone number, you will probably get that person’s White Pages listing which includes the telephone number.  As an added feature, Google includes a couple of mapping services in case you want to look up the location.  In the same way, you can enter the telephone number alone and if it is a listed number, you’ll get the complete listing including the address and, if desired, the mapping to that address. The problem with the eRumor is that it makes it sound as though this is priviledged information, which it is not.  It’s the same information that could be gotten from a phone book or directory assistance.  It also makes it sound as though the feature is specifically for the purpose of entering a phone number and finding a map.  It is not.  The feature finds all the listed information about phone number and includes the mapping if you choose it. If, for some reason, you do not wish for your information to be available through Google, you can, as the eRumor describes, click the telephone icon next to your information and they will remove you from their database, but that means very little.  The reason the information is there is because it’s public and removing it from Google doesn’t prevent anyone from having it.  They can go to the telephone book, directory assistance, or any of the other pages on the Internet that have name, address, and telephone information.  If you don’t want the information to be public, contact your telephone provider and ask about an unlisted number or a number that does not list your address.

"The “friendlygreetings” e-card that acts like a virus-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/e-card/"," A warning is circulating on the Internet about a “virus-like” program that says a friend has sent you an e-card, but if you respond to it, all the addresses in your Outlook address book will be sent to the greeting card company. "," The warning is true.  What appears to be an invitation to read an e-card actually forwards your Outlook addresses to a Spammer who will be sending advertisements to your friends about pornography. The email arrives with a cartoon-like graphic that says “You have received an e-card.  Click here to open.”  It says it’s from friendlygreetings.com, friendgreetings.com, or laugh-mail.com.  In smaller print you are told that an e-card viewer plug-in may be required to view some cards.  When you click on the link to view your card, you are asked to run an installer.  You are also asked to read and approve some fine-print but since most of us don’t take the time to read that stuff, you don’t realize that that you have just approved a user agreement that authorizes all of the addresses in your Microsoft Outlook address book to be sent to the originator of the message.  According to Bob Sullivan of MSNBC, this is a scheme to collect email addresses for a Spammer and one who sends porn Spam.  CNN says this particular site, which has since been taken down, was operated by a Canadian company called Cytron Communications. It’s not technically a virus since it doesn’t “infect” your computer or damage it and you have given permission for the email addresses to be collected.  It is misleading and sleazy and doesn’t disclose that the email addresses will be used for Spam. Most legitimate e-card companies do not ask you to download a file.  They merely refer you to a safe website where your greeting card can be viewed online. Virus experts are warning that there are other companies now trying this tactic.  They suggest avoiding installing programs from emails and that if there is fine-print, read it.  Also, Lawrence Baldwin, president of Internet security firm myNetWatchman.com told CNN that he suggests  disabling the Internet Explorer function that allows browsers to instantly download ActiveX Controls. Doing so will cause a warning box to appear anytime such files are encountered, which could get annoying because Macromedia Flash, used to create Web animations, uses ActiveX Controls. Although at least one virus protection program will alert you to the danger of the friendlygreetings.com email, not all of the virus protection companies are classifying it as a virus and are not detecting it.

"," The eRumor is true. Most web addresses begin with “HTTP,” which is an acronym for “Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.”  It’s the protocol used to allow you to communicate with web sites. “HTTPS” stands for “Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.”  It means that information exchanged between you and a web site is encrypted and cannot be hijacked by someone who might want to electronically eavesdrop when you type a credit card number, a password, a social security number, or any other person information. The purpose of the email is to encourage you to check for the “HTTPS” before you give financial information.  Most web sites are not HTTPS, but when you click a link to make a purchase, many of them will direct you to an HTTPS site. According to Verisign.com, a provider of Internet infrastructure services, Secure Socket Layer Encryption is a technology that protects Web sites and makes it easy to develop trust by means of an “SSL Certificate that enables encryption of sensitive information during online transactions.  Each SSL Certificate contains unique, authenticated information about the certificate owner and a Certificate Authority verifies the identity of the certificate owner when it is issued. “ Just because a website uses such SSL encryption does not safeguard internet users from phishing and other schemes.  When visiting websites that accept financial information online it is always a wise practice to make sure the online company is legitimate, has a good reputation in customer service and uses SSL encryption in their transactions. updated 02/03/09 ","Computers"

"," It’s true that some Netflix subscribers may be eligible to receive a portion of a settlement from a class action lawsuit involving Netflix and Walmart — but the deadline to file claims has already passed. The settlement applies to those who subscribed to a Netflix mail order DVD rental plan between May 2005 and September 2011. The deadline to file a claim was in February 2012, however, so anyone who has not already done so won’t be eligible for a cash payment. Back in 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against Walmart Stores Inc., Walmart.com USA LLC and Netflix alleging that the companies had violated anti-trust law. The companies entered into an agreement that sent all of Walmart’s mail order DVD rental subscribers (yes, Walmart briefly had a DVD rental service) to Netflix. In exchange, Walmart promoted Nextflix on its website and received 10% of revenues from its former subscribers and a $36 “bounty” for every new subscriber that came through Walmart’s website, according to the lawsuit filed against Walmart . The class action lawsuit filed against Walmart and Netflix alleged that the agreement “reflected an illegal allocation of the online DVD-rental market.” Both companies were also accused of “conspiracy to monopolize the online DVD-rental market.” Walmart reached a settlement in 2011, and a judge dismissed the case against Netflix. After years of appeals and legal rangling, the settlement reached in the Walmart case was finally made final in February 2015, according onlinedvvdclass.com . Terms of that settlement were negotiated back in 2011. Walmart was ordered to pay $27.25 million in cash and gift cars to settle the lawsuit, but about 25% of that was to be set aside to pay for attorney’s fees. The suit’s lead plaintiffs, the Netflix subscribers who brought the original complaint, were to receive $5,000 each. The remaining money would be set divvied out to remaining Netflix subscribers who filed a claim before February 2012, CNN Money reported back when the settlement was finalized. It’s not clear how many Netflix subscribers filed a claim to receive a slice of the settlement, but the company had about 24 million subscribers who would have been eligible by the end of September 2011. So, it’s true that some Netflix subscribers are eligible for a cash or gift card payout — but it’s too late to claim it unless you filed a claim back in 2012. Those who did file a claim on time were expected to receive their payout on November 5, 2015. A previous version of this story was published on 11/17/11: The   lawsuit is real. It is against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,  Walmart.com USA LLC and Netflix, Inc.  It seeks money on behalf of current and former Netflix subscribers is real.  It has not yet been settled and notifications as to where to file a claim form have been sent out to Netflix customers by email.   Additional information on the lawsuit and how Netflix customers may collect was put up on the Internet at http://www.OnlineDVDclass.com . According to this site, plaintiffs in the class action suit claimed that the two companies reached an unlawful agreement under which Wal-Mart would stop renting DVDs online and Netflix would not sell new videos on DVD. The deadline to submit a Claim Form is February 14, 2012 and it can be done over the Internet or by requesting a form by calling 1-877-389-4469. As a matter of safe Internet practice, readers should manually type the URL into your web browsing software instead of clicking the link in emails to avoid a possible redirection from a scammer.

"Microsoft Patent That Requires Paying Attention to Computer Ads","2015-03-17 18:06:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/microsoft-patent/"," The eRumor says that Microsoft had applied for a patent that would force you to look at advertisements on your computer or the computer could be disabled. "," The eRumor is based on an article published in the British online tech magazine The Inquirer. (www.theinquirer.net). The patent application is real (#20070033102) and is assigned to Microsoft.  The purpose is to come up with a way that ensures that web ads are really being read and would reward the computer user as a result.  The patent application includes a list of potential ways of doing that such.  For example, delivering paid ads to people who may be asked to answer a question about the ad or indicate in some other way that they really sat in front of their computers, saw the ads, and comprehended what they said.  It mentions the possibility of using some device, perhaps a camera, to view and recognize the face of the person reading the ads. The article leaves the impression that the average computer user would be penalized for not reading the ads and, perhaps, having your computer disabled but that is misleading.  That would only happen if, for example, you had been given a computer for free in return for seeing the ads and the computer had a way of knowing whether you were really living up to your end of the bargain.

"," According to a July 30,2012 article in the Wall Street Journal , the Independent’s Los Angeles bureau chief, Guy Adams, said that “his Twitter account was suspended after allegedly breaking Twitter’s privacy rules by publishing the email of the NBC Olympics chief and encouraging people to email their complaints.”   The article also said that Twitter for the London Games and NBC are official partners, “although there is currently no indication that this relationship has played a part in Twitter’s decision.” Adams tweeted, “The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven’t started yet is Gary Zenkel, Tell him what u think!” and included his email address at NBC. In his July 31, 2012 Independent article , Adams wrote, “The site claims I broke its rules because I included Zenkel’s work email address in a Tweet posted on Friday, when America had been forced to watch the opening ceremony on time-delay.” Adams also said that he contacted the Twitter “trust and safety” department to get his account status restored and their response was, “If you would like to request your account to be restored, please respond to this email and confirm that you’ve read and understood our rules.” Adams’ response to the social media giant was included in his article: Evening And sorry for the radio silence. For obvious reasons, my day has been a wee bit busier than normal. I would love my Twitter account to be un-suspended. However you have asked me to “confirm that I have read and understood” your rules. I’ve read, and I have re-read your rules. Clearly I don’t understand them, though, because I have no idea how I broke them. You claim that I posted a “private email address.” I did no such thing. I posted a corporate email address, not a private one. It was, like the work address of every other NBC Universal account holder, written in a very un-private format: firstname.lastname@nbcuni.com. Moreover, it was already easily identifiable to anyone in possession of 30 seconds of free time and access to Google. For example, it had been published online over a year ago, at the link below http://www.fidei.org/2011/06/boycott-nbc-removed-under-god-from.html You will, I am sure, be aware that your own privacy policy, which you have urged me to read, states that “If information was previously posted or displayed elsewhere on the Internet prior to being put on Twitter, it is not a violation of this policy.” Mr Zenkel’s email address HAD been posted on the internet prior to being put on Twitter, Therefore can you explain how my Tweet violated your policy? Or are you making this up as you go along? Moreover, I just received a copy of a written statement from an NBC spokesman called Christopher McCloskey. It was issued via email this evening to Amy Willis, a correspondent at the Daily Telegraph, in answer to her query regarding how NBC’s complaint came to be lodged with Twitter, and how NBC originally became aware of my original Tweet. Mr McCloskey states (and I quote): “Our social media dept was actually alerted to it by Twitter and then we filled out the form and submitted it.” Unless he is lying, this means that my account was suspended after Twitter decided, at its own behest, to get in touch with a commercial partner in order to encourage them to have a hostile journalist removed from the Twitter-sphere. Surely this runs against everything your company is supposed to represent? And surely it completely undermines Twitter’s entire raison d’etre, corporate ethos, etc? Mr McCloskey’s email to Ms Willia also, helpfully, includes contact details for a Twitter spokesman, Rachael Horwitz. Am I to take it that this means NBC and Twitter’s media departments are in some sort cahoots regarding this whole thing? And if so, does this whole thing not have a whiff of fish? I don’t know exactly where I’m meant to go from here, except to say that I really would like a proper explanation of how and why my Twitter account has been suspended. And I’d also quite like to have it un-suspended. Please? Guy The Twitter account of Guy Adams was eventually unsuspended on the morning of July 31, 2012. updated 07/31/12 ","Computers"

"," In September 2011 Facebook made some   modifications to their social network site which sparked an old hoax to   rise from the ashes.  This eRumor began circulating in 2010 saying   that users would be charged $24.13 per month to access Facebook. It   reemerged in July 2011 and later again the following September after the   popular site added some modifications to their pages. The social network site does not need to charge   members monthly fees because it makes most of its revenue from   advertising, which is viewed by more than 800 million active users.     According to a September 20, 2011 article in Bloomberg , the company is expected to   earn $4.2 billion in advertising revenue and is expected to make $470   million from the sale of game credits.  In 2010 advertising sales   amounted to $1.86 billion and game credit sales earned Facebook $140   million. Addressing the original hoax, a Facebook spokesperson said, “We have no   plans to charge users for Facebook’s basic services. Facebook is a free   service for its 350 million users,” according to a January 12, 2010 article in England’s Telegraph.

One day on a planet far, far away, a catalog from a famous lingerie store inexplicably showed up in the mailbox at one horny alien’s home.

No self-respecting supermodel can resist these items. * Camera – Once the correct model is found wearing the right panties, and the outer clothing has been removed, it’s time to use the camera to photograph the model. These photos are then added to the player’s inventory. If all the correct models in the correct lingerie are photographed within the given amount of time, Earth is saved.

"Al Gore claimed responsibility for creation of the Internet-Truth!","2015-03-17 17:52:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/goreinternet/"," Al Gore has made statements that he is the creator of the Internet. "," This comes from a television interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that was aired on March 9,1999.  TruthOrFiction.com has a transcript of the entire broadcast.  Vice President Gore was not yet a formal candidate for the presidency, but was clearly setting the stage for it, and Blitzer’s questions focused on his potential campaign.  At one point, Blitzer asked Gore why the Democrats should support him over rival Bill Bradley.  Gore answered, “Well, I will — I’ll be offering my vision when my campaign begins, and it’ll be comprehensive and sweeping, and I hope that it’ll be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I’ve traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. ” Some of the emails criticizing Gore for this statement point out that Gore has often shown ignorance about computers, so how could he have created the Internet?  He did not claim, however, to be a computer geek who toiled in his basement and came up with the idea.  He did claim that somehow as a member of congress he not only played in role in creating the Internet, but “took the initiative” to do it. To his credit, Al Gore has participated in advancing information technology.  When he was a senator, he supported funding for NSFNet through the High Performance Computing Act that became law in 1991.  He wrote guest columns for Byte magazine that reflected an appreciation of technology.  But even his supporters have to say that any notion of having created the Internet is tough to stomach. According to the encyclopedia Britannica, the Internet dates back to at least 1973 and in an article that broke the Gore story, Declan McCullagh of Wired News says the Net goes back as far as 1967 when Al gore was 19 years old.  The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency started experimenting with ways to allow networked computers to link and communicate.  It was called The Internetting project and the ultimate system became known as The Internet.  In a related article on March 11, 1999 in Wired News, McCullagh says Gore has introduced bills about software for teachers and a “federal research center for educational computing to support an “information systems highway.” We’ve never found any explanation by Gore as to why he made the claim, but he did have a sense of humor about it.  At a meeting of Democratic leaders, he said, ” I was pretty tired when I made that comment because I had been up very late the night before inventing the camcorder.”","Computers"

This email message attempts to say that there has been federal legislation that addresses the issue and defines some of the conditions under which the Spam has been declared okay.  It is not true, however.  There was such a bill in the 105th congress but the language regarding “Spam” was removed before it was passed by the Senate and the bill was never passed by the House of Representatives.  It never became law. Spam experts warn not to respond to an unsolicited email.  Many of them don’t have your email address.  They may have had a bulk mailing service send you the email and if you reply with a request to be removed from their list, some of them will have your email address for the first time and not only will not remove you, but will now include your email address in their own records. There are responsible businesses using email.  The most responsible will never email you or put your email on a mailing list unless you’ve requested it.  Also, responsible businesses will usually send the email from an email address that is easily identified as theirs and will include information in the email that reveals who they are and how to contact them either via email or a website.  They will also offer you an opportunity to be removed from their email list.  Businesses that are not so responsible use random, temporary email addresses, do not include any information about who they are or how to contact them directly, and even though they offer an opportunity to be removed from their email list, many of them don’t honor that.  If they do include a phone number or address, it is frequently a voice mail, not a direct, live connection.","Computers"
