"President Obama Apologized for Dropping Atomic Bombs on Japan-Fiction!","2016-05-31 09:46:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-apologized-dropping-atomic-bombs-japan/"," As America honored fallen soldiers on Memorial Day weekend, reports that President Obama visited Hiroshima to apologize for dropping an atomic there to end World War II fueled outrage on social media. "," President Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima since an atomic bomb was dropped there in August 1945 — but reports that he apologized are false. Obama visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on May 27th and laid a wreath in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in remembrance of those killed by the atomic bombs that ended World War II. That sparked accusations that the president was on an “apology tour” — which has been a running theme among his critics throughout Obama’s presidency. However, according to transcripts of public remarks that Obama delivered in Hiroshima , he never offered an apology. Rather, he used the visit to warn against the danger of nuclear proliferation. Obama opened his speech with this explanation of his visit: Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself. Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not-so-distant past. We come to mourn the dead, including over 100,000 Japanese men, women and children, thousands of Koreans, a dozen Americans held prisoner. Their souls speak to us. They ask us to look inward, to take stock of who we are and what we might become. Later in his speech, Obama indicated that his visit to Hiroshima was part of a larger call for the world’s powers to draw down nuclear stockpiles and to end nuclear proliferation: That is why we come to this place. We stand here in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell. We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. We listen to a silent cry. We remember all the innocents killed across the arc of that terrible war and the wars that came before and the wars that would follow. Mere words cannot give voice to such suffering. But we have a shared responsibility to look directly into the eye of history and ask what we must do differently to curb such suffering again. Some day, the voices of the hibakusha will no longer be with us to bear witness. But the memory of the morning of Aug. 6, 1945, must never fade. That memory allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. So, claims that President Obama apologized for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima are false. ","War"

"Owen John Baggett Killed Japanese Pilot in Mid Air-Reported as Truth!","2016-03-15 14:32:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/owen-john-baggett-killed-japanese-pilot-mid-air/"," Owen John Baggett, a pilot who flew B-24s in World War II, shot and killed a Japanese pilot with a revolver while he parachuting to the ground from his destroyed airplane. "," By all accounts, it’s true that Owen John Baggett killed a Japanese pilot while parachuting to the ground during World War II. There are accounts of Owen John Baggett’s legendary feat circulating in blog posts, emails and discussion forums. Many of these can be traced back to a profile on Baggett that appeared in Air Force Magazine . The legend goes that 2nd Lt. Owen J. Baggett was dispatched along with the 7th Bomb Group’s 9th Squadron to destroy a bridge near a Japanese base halfway between Rangoon and Mandalay in Burma on March 31, 1943. Baggett was the copilot of a B-24 bomber, and 1st Col. Lloyd Jansen was the pilot. When the plane was severely damaged by enemy fighters, Jansen gave the order for the crew to bail out, which Baggett conveyed through hand signals because the intercom had been destroyed. Baggett parachuted from the plane, and, Air Force Magazine reports: The Japanese pilots immediately began strafing the surviving crewmen, apparently killing some of them and grazing Lieutenant Baggett’s arm. The pilot who had hit Baggett circled to finish him off or perhaps only to get a better look at his victim. Baggett pretended to be dead, hoping the Zero pilot would not fire again. In any event, the pilot opened his canopy and approached within feet of Baggett’s chute, nose up and on the verge of a stall. Baggett, enraged by the strafing of his helpless crewmates, raised the .45 automatic concealed against his leg and fired four shots at the open cockpit. The Zero stalled and spun in. After Baggett hit the ground, enemy pilots continued to strafe him, but he escaped by hiding behind a tree. Lieutenant Jensen and one of the gunners landed near him. All three were captured by the Burmese and turned over to the Japanese. Sergeant Crostic also survived the bailout. Baggett and Jensen were flown out of Burma in an enemy bomber and imprisoned near Singapore. The Japanese held Owen Baggett prisoner for more than two years. Air Force Magazine cites three pieces of evidence to support claims that Baggett shot the Japanese zero pilot while he parachuted to the ground: A few months later, Col. Harry Melton, commander of the 311th Fighter Group who had been shot down, passed through the POW camp and told Baggett that a Japanese colonel said the pilot Owen Baggett had fired at had been thrown clear of his plane when it crashed and burned. He was found dead of a single bullet in his head. Colonel Melton intended to make an official report of the incident but lost his life when the ship on which he was being taken to Japan was sunk. Two other pieces of evidence support Baggett’s account: First, no friendly fighters were in the area that could have downed the Zero pilot. Second, the incident took place at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. The pilot could have recovered from an unintentional stall and spin. There was no official report of Baggett shooting a zero pilot from mid air, but Air Force Magazine concluded that “there appears to be no reasonable doubt” that legends of Baggett’s valor are true. Owen Baggett died in 2006. His obituary told of his time in the Air Force, and of the time he shot down a Japanese Zero with a handgun. Still, the obituary says that Baggett’s biggest accomplishment was he “survived the horrors of the war and his interment without bitterness or hatred.” The obit reads: COL. OWEN JOHN BAGGETT, USAF, RET Col. Owen Baggett died at peace and with dignity July 27, 2006 in New Braunfels, TX. Born August 29, 1920 in Graham, Texas to John M. and Mary Pearl Baggett, he was always quick with a smile and a kind word. He never met a stranger, and was loved by many. He relished his activities as Drum Major for the Hardin Simmons University Cowboy band, and made many lifelong friends during his years there. He received some fame for shooting down a Japanese Zero with a revolver while hanging from a parachute after his B-24 bomber was shot down, and he subsequently spent 2-1/2 years as a Prisoner of War at Changi prison camp in Rangoon, Burma during World War II. The essence of the man, however, is that he survived the horrors of war and his internment without bitterness or hatred. Enduring starvation and torture showed the strength of his body, but it is by his forgiveness of his tormentors that truly reveals the strength of his soul. He will be deeply missed by all those he touched. He is survived by his daughter, Diana Farrar of San Antonio, TX, his former wife, Pat Baggett of Kerrville, TX, cousin Pauline Morton of Archer City, TX her son Gary, his wife Carin and daughter Ana of Austin, TX, cousin Ken Garrett of Redwing, MN, his son Jim and daughter Ellie, cousin Julia Garrett of Roanoke, VA., numerous second cousins and countless friends. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, August 1 at the Doeppenschmidt Funeral Home in Canyon Lake, Texas, with internment at 9:15, Wednesday August 2 at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX.

"The True Military Record of John McCain-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-07-23 07:48:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-true-military-record-of-john-mccain/"," A viral email that claims to tell about “the true military record of John McCain” argues that the Arizona senator isn’t a true war hero. "," Claims about John McCain’s fall can be classified as “all of the above.” They’re true, false and unproven. Many of these claims surfaced during the 2008 presidential election. Then, the rumors resurfaced in July 2015 after Donald Trump, a 2016 presidential contender, said McCain was only considered a war hero because he had been captured during the Vietnam War. That idea first appeared in a blog post titled, “The True Military Record of John McCain, Written By an Active Marine” in 2008. But the so-called “active Marine” that penned the blog is unnamed, so we can’t verify its authorship. Everyone’s definition of a “war hero” varies, but the blog post makes a number of direct accusations about McCain’s war record that can be fact checked and verified: McCain Became Squadron Commander Because of Family Connections- Fiction! It’s not true that John McCain was “promoted to squadron commander of the airfield named after his own grandfather immediately after crashing his third airplane.” McCain was promoted to squadron commander at Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1976 — after he spent five years in captivity at the “Hanoi Hilton” in North Vietnam. Also, the crash in North Vietnam was his fifth crash as an airman, not his third. The claim that Cecil Airfield was named after his grandfather is also false. McCain’s paternal grandfather’s name was John McCain Sr ., and his maternal grandfather was named Archie Wright . However, McCain’s father and grandfather were both decorated airmen. McCain Was Awarded 28 Medals After Spending 20 Hours in Combat- Unproven! & Fiction! There’s no record of exactly how many hours McCain spent flying combat missions in the Vietnam War. He was, however, shot down and captured while flying his 23rd combat mission on October 26, 1967. Also, the Navy unsealed John McCain’s military record in 2008, and it revealed that he had received 17 awards and decorations during his career — not 28, as the eRumor claims: McCain attended the U.S. Naval Academy from 1954 to 1958, and was commissioned as an ensign in June of that year. He retired in April 1981 with the rank of captain. In that time he received 17 awards and decorations. Besides the Silver Star Medal, McCain also received the Legion of Merit with a combat “V” and one gold star, a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Bronze Star Medal with a combat “V” and two gold stars. Several citations mention his achievements either as a prisoner or as a lieutenant commander flying bombing runs off the deck of the USS Oriskany. Some are signed by then-Secretary of the Navy John Warner, who would become a colleague of McCain’s in the Senate. The citation for his Distinguished Flying Cross sums up McCain’s misfortune the following day: “Although his aircraft was severely damaged, he continued his bomb delivery pass and released his bombs on the target. When the aircraft would not recover from the dive, Commander McCain was forced to eject over the target.” Years later, as his Navy career approached its end, McCain received the Legion of Merit Medal. By then, his missions were in the halls of Congress as a liaison to the Senate from the Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs. He was praised for providing Navy leaders “with sage advice and sound judgment for enacting critical legislation during a period of severe fiscal constraint.” McCain Finished Near the Bottom of His Class at the U.S. Naval Academy- Truth! It’s true that John McCain graduated near the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. Some reports say that he graduated 790th out of 795 students. McCain alluded to his academic record there during a commencement speech in 1997: This is quite an unexpected honor for a Naval Academy midshipman who graduated fifth from the bottom in the Class of ’58. All those years ago, when I was a midshipman, I indulged in the normal daydreams of a young man about what kind of honors awaited me later in life. These rumors about John McCain’s military records aren’t likely to go away anytime soon, but some have persisted for years even though they can easily be proven false. ","War"

"," There’s no proof that Jade Helm 15 is anything more than a standard military training exercise. The U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has headed up the Jade Helm 15. It’s set to be held in seven southwestern states from July to September of 2015, according to unclassified documents : “(Jade Helm) is a challenging eight-week joint military and interagency (IA) Unconventional Warfare (UW) exercise conducted throughout Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. “(Jade Helm) is a USSOCOM sponsored exercise to improve the Special Operations Forces’ UW capability as part of the National Security Strategy.” Elite military units like the Green Berets and Navy SEALS will take part in the exercise, along with local officials that are invited to participate. The documents explain that much of the exercise will be held in Texas: “The USSOCOM has conducted numerous exercises in Texas because Texans are historically supportive of efforts to prepare our soldiers, airmen, marines and sailors to fight the enemies of the United States. “To hone advanced skills, the military and interagency require large areas of undeveloped land with low population densities with access to towns. The proposed areas offer the conditions conducive to quality training because of real obstacles to challenge joint and interagency personnel during planning and execution of their tasks.” Thomas Mead, the operations planner for Jade Helm 15, offered more information about the training exercise when asked commissioners in Goliad County, Texas, for permission to move forward, mySouTex.com reports : “This allows our soldiers to get a better training environment,” Mead said. “You can only do so much in a military environment. You don’t really get a true interaction with the public. “We have Army Green Berets, Navy Seals, Marine Special Operations Command, the 82nd Airborne Division and we also have some of our interagency partners such as the DEA, FBI and the joint personnel recovery agency that will be working with us. “We’re getting these guys back into the woods,” Mead said. “We’re getting them back into the field to make it hard for them.” Mead said that neighbors in the area could expect to see an increase in air traffic at night, and that the exercise may result in noise complaints. Mead added that some of the participants would have weapons with blank ammunition and would be wearing civilian clothes. A video posted on YouTube titled, “Red Dawn and the New World Order” fueled speculation about the Jade Helm 15 exercise. In the video , a narrator reads through planning documents and encourages viewers to speculate about what each page could mean. Speculation aside, there’s no proof that Jade Helm 15 is anything more than a normal military training exercise.

"," This eRumor started   circulating in August, 2008. “Yellowcake” (or “yellowcakes”) is a concentrate of uranium that results from the refinement of uranium ore.  It is used for making fuel for nuclear power plants and to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. On July 7, 2008 the American Forces Press Service released a statement of the completion of a classified mission dubbed “Operation McCall” to transfer 500 metric tons of yellowcake at the request of the Iraqi government from Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center near Baghdad to Canada. Click here to read the story posted on the Department of Defense site. According to published reports including CBS news, the United States secretly moved a huge stockpile of yellowcake over a two week period, from Iraq to Canada, partly to keep it from falling into the hands of either terrorists or foreign governments such as Iran. The operation was reportedly more than a year in the making and took three months to execute.  It included carrying 3,500 barrels of yellowcake by road from Baghdad, then flying them on 37 military flights to an atoll in the Indian Ocean, then carrying them aboard a U.S. ship bound for Montreal.  In all, it added up to more than 500 metric tons of material from Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program. The Iraqi government sold the yellowcake to a Canadian uranium company and it will be used in Ontario, Canada, for use in nuclear reactors. A CBS report said, “ And, in a symbolic way, the mission linked the current attempts to stabilize Iraq with some of the high-profile claims about Saddam’s weapons capabilities in the buildup to the 2003 invasion.  Accusations that Saddam had tried to purchase more yellowcake from the African nation of Niger – and an article by a former U.S. ambassador refuting the claims – led to a wide-ranging probe into Washington leaks that reached high into the Bush administration. “ The news report went on to say that the yellowcake “had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War.

"," What most people want to know is whether Powell made this statement. He did, although some other facts in the eRumor are incorrect. First, Powell’s statement was not made in England. It was during a presentation to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland during January, 2003. Second, the questioner was not the current Archbishop of Canterbury, but the former Archbishop, George Carey. Third,  Carey was not asking about “empire building.”  He asked Powell whether the U.S. was relying too much on “hard power” such as military action as opposed to “soft power” such as appealing to the common values of the major religions and building trust based on those values. Powell responded by affirming the “soft power” of values but that it was the “hard power” of the military that, for example, helped free Europe and so the “soft power” of peace and reconstruction could take place. Powell then said, “ We have gone forth from our shores repeatedly over the last hundred years and we’ve done this as recently as the last year in Afghanistan and put wonderful young men and women at risk, many of whom have lost their lives, and we have asked for nothing except enough ground to bury them in, and otherwise we have returned home to seek our own, you know, to seek our own lives in peace, to live our own lives in peace.

Again, according to an April, 2004 report from UNICEF, school attendance in Iraq increased by 60 percent shortly after the war to more than 95 percent during the recent national exam week. More than 1,500 schools renovated- Truth! UNICEF says that as of April, 2004, more than 2,500 schools have been renovated with the goal of 4,000 being completed by the end of the year, but 10,000 more need repair. The Port of Uhm Qasar [sic] renovated so grain can be offloaded faster- Truth!

Iraqi oil reached 2 billion barrels exported in August of 2003- Fiction! Iraq sits on the second largest proven crude oil reserves in the world and the flow of oil resumed in August, 2003 amid equipment that needed repair and suffered from looting and attacks from saboteurs. The initial flow in August, 2003, was 500,000 barrels per day, according to the BBC. Iraqi oil is subject to the ups and downs of the crude oil market but in April, 2003, more than 2 million barrels a day were being produced, but that has not accumulated to 2 billion. Clean drinking water for the first time for than 4.5 million Iraqis- Fiction! According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, safe drinking water was not widespread in Iraq before the U.S. led coalition invaded Iraq but that was partly because of water treatment systems that were in disrepair or had been looted. In other words, clean water is not new to Iraq. We couldn’t find any figures that indicated how many would be receiving clean water for the first time. In December, 2003, USAID was on track to provide clean water to more than 14 million Iraqis. Iraq has twice the electrical power than before the war- Fiction! USAID says power was restored in October, 2003 to slightly more than pre-war levels, or more than 4500 MW as opposed to about 4400 MW prior to the war. The goal was to reach 6000 MW by the summer of 2004. All of the hospitals operating- Truth! Because of disrepair and looting, it took a lot of work to get hospitals back up to speed but according to James Haverman, the Coalition Provisional Authority Senior Advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, all 240 hospitals in Iraq as well as 2400 primary health care clinics were operating as of December, 2003. Elections taking place in all major cities- Fiction! This has been a source of contention in Iraq. In June of 2003 U.S. authorities called halts to local elections across Iraq and chose to put hand-chosen mayors or administrators into office. There have been various local elections since that time and debate over whether Iraq is ready for national elections.

Work is underway to restore healthy water and sewage treatment to more than 14-million Iraqis. More than 60,000 police in the streets, more than 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police securing the country, and 80,000 Iraqi soldiers patrolling the streets with the U.S. soldiers- Mostly Fiction!

The first class of more than 400 police offers graduated in January, 2004.

On March 8, 2004, an interim constitution that defines Iraq as being “federal, democratic and pluralist” was signed by members of the Iraqi Governing Council. Girls are allowed to attend school- Truth! But Misleading! A quick read of Sgt. Reynolds’ report would leave the impression that Iraqi girls are able to attend school for the first time because of the invasion. According to Human Rights Watch, Iraqi girls and women have enjoyed comparatively more rights than in some of the other countries of the Middle East. The Iraqi Constitution of 1970 included women’s rights for voting, attending school, owning property, and running for office. Still, the status of women in Iraq has not always been the best because of other cultural and economic factors such as the aftermath of the 1991 war and economic sanctions. School attendance for girls has not been prohibited although more boys than girls have been enrolled, especially in rural areas. Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs- Truth!

The airplane in the pictures is a Mig 25, nicknamed The Foxbat.  Reith said that it is one of two dozen that were sent to Iraq in 1979 by the Soviets.  The Mig 25 did not perform well, however, in either the Iran-Iraq war or the gulf war in 1991.  It was no match for British and U.S. in the Gulf War planes so Sadaam Hussein did not use the planes very much after two of them were quickly shot down.  Reith said that by the time U.S. and coalition troops invaded Iraq in 2003 the jets were not in action.  They had been hidden by burying them in desert sand. Contrary to the claims of the forwarded email, these were not “buried treasure” equipped with “sophisticated electronic warfare devices.”  Reith reported that they were remnants of the cold war and more than 30-years old.  In other words, nothing that had not been seen by the U.S. before.

"A military draft in 2005?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/draft/"," The eRumor warns that there are two bills before Congress that, if passed, would bring back the military draft and make it mandatory for both boys and girls starting in June, 2005. "," The bills, S.89 and H.R.163 are real. But they are not new. An eRumor started circulating in June, 2004 warning that the draft was only a year away. In reality, these twin bills have existed since 2003 and have never gotten out of committees. In other words, they are stagnant. Nobody in Washington seriously expects a draft and certainly not by 2005. It’s known as the “reinstate draft” bill or the “Universal National Service Act of 2003.” The wording of the bill says it is “To provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.” It would require U.S. citizens and other residents, both male and female, between the ages of 18 and 26 to serve two years of “national service.” The reason the bills have gotten attention in 2004 is the military actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the war on terrorism. There has been debate about troop strength in Iraq and the status of all the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Selective Service, however, says that despite the Internet stories, the agency is not getting ready to conduct a draft. It says it is ready to do so should the President and Congress decide, but “that responsibility has been ongoing since 1980 and is nothing new.” The Selective Service further says that “…both the President and the Secretary of Defense have stated on more than one occasion that there is no need for a draft for the War on Terrorism or any likely contingency, such as Iraq. Additionally, the Congress has not acted on any proposed legislation to reinstate a draft.” Last updated 6/18/04 ","War"

"," Vicky’s son is named Chad Snowden. This prayer request first started circulating in November or December of 2004 and became widely circulated. According to a U.S. Army website, Chad was wounded by a sniper on November 13, 2004 while on patrol in Iraq. An article from May 5, 2005 in the Hood County News in Granbury, Texas, says that Chad is home and has recovered enough that he’s thinking about going to college. According to the article, the sniper’s bullet hit Snowden just above and behind his left eyebrow and exited the right side. From the time his mother first heard of his injuries it was only five days from the time that he was regarded as extremely critical until he could be moved from Iraq to Germany for treatment.  Then once in Germany, he was kept for only a day until being moved to Water Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. While there, he and his mother met President and Mrs. Bush as they visited wounded soldiers and their families at Walter Reed. Chad’s injuries were such that only a small part of his brain was damaged. In a short time, he was ready to be moved from Walter Reed to a military rehabilitation trauma brain injury hospital but, according to the article, that was delayed because of an  overload of paperwork required. Vicky shot into action and has since become employed by the Department of Defense project to help people like Chad who’ve gotten lost in the paperwork. She works with the newly formed Military Severely Injured Joint Operations Center and makes sure that veterans are connected to military benefits. Her first project was for a reservist from Texas named Eric Richardson.  He spent three months in the desert in Kuwait with boots that were a size too small and came away with a rare nerve condition that he says spread throughout his body including his brain. Now his memory is bad, his vision and hearing are affected, and he cannot walk. Vicky Field discovered that the roof in Richardson’s home is leaking and some of the ceiling has collapsed including in his 4-year-old child’s bedroom. She ran into a roofer at a gas station, told him about the Richardsons, and got the roof fixed. There is a toll-free hotline for the Military Severely Injured Joint Operations Center at 888-774-1361.

It is true that her current husband has filed for divorce, but it’s not a second divorce.  The couple had a total of four children, two sons and two daughters.  According to records filed in Solano County District Court in California, Sheehan’s husband Patrick filed for divorce on August 12 saying that the couple had been separated since June.

Most of these statements were during the debate over whether to use force against Iraq. "," There are several quotes. Most of them come during a time in the Clinton administration when decisions were being made about action against Saddam Hussein and amid concerns about weapons of mass destruction. We’ll take them one at a time. “One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.” President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998- Truth! This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq. “If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program.” President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998- Truth! Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. His remarks followed that briefing. “Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face.” Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998- Truth! This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton. “He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.” Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998- Truth! This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. “We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998- Truth! According to the U.S. Senate website, the text of this letter was signed by several Senators, both Democrat and Republican, including Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. “Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 – Truth! The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website. “Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.” Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999- Truth! This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago. She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country.  Albright said, “There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It’s just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies.” “There is no doubt that … Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.” Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 Truth! The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman. It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq. “We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.” Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002- Truth! These were remarks from Senator Levin to a Senate committee on that date. “We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! This and the quote below was part of prepared remarks for a speech in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club. “Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.” Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002- Truth! “We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002- Truth! Part of a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins. “The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons…” Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002- Truth! On the floor of the Senate during debate over the resolution that would authorize using force against Iraq. He was urging caution about going to war and commented that even though there was confidence about the weapons in Iraq, there had not been the need to take military action for a number of years and he asked why there would be the need at that point. “I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force– if necessary– to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.” Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002- Truth! Senator Kerry’s comments were made to the Senate as part of the same debate over the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein. “There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years … We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Rockefeller’s statements were a part of the debate over using force against Saddam Hussein. “He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do” Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Waxman’s contribution to the Senate debate over going to war. “In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members.  It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002- Truth! Senator Clinton acknowledged the threat of Saddam Hussein but said she did not feel that using force at that time was a good option. “Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation … And now he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …” Sen.

"Death rate comparison to Iraq and Washington DC-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gun-deaths-joke/"," An eRumor comparing the number of gun-related deaths among soldiers killed in action in IRAQ with the number of gun related deaths in Washington DC . It concludes that the ratio of deaths per 100.000 in Washington DC was worse than the same ratio in  Iraq and closes by saying that the US should pull out of Washington! "," This eRumor has circulated for   several years and is meant more to be a joke than a serious assessment   of statistics. In addition to   Washington DC , TruthorFiction.com has received various versions naming   different cities including Philadelphia , New York, and Chicago . Sometimes the eRumor   claims that the text is from a magazine article. It is not clear what   date the eRumor was first circulated so it’s hard to know what actual   figures, if any, the writer was using for the 22-month comparison but   here is the best we can come up with: The total U.S. war   casualties referenced in the eRumor is 2112. That would mean that   the probable date of those figures would be November, 2005 when,   according to month-by-month figures the casualties in Iraq reached 2113. We’re not sure why the   writer chose to refer to that as a 22 month count because from the   beginning of the war in March, 2003 to November, 2005, was actually   about 30 months and that’s the period of time it took to reach a   casualty count of 2113. For approximately the   same period, the number of gun-related deaths in Washington DC was 464.   The population of Washington DC during that same period averaged about   560,000, for a rate of deaths per 100,000 of about 82. The eRumor’s   calculation of the death rate in Iraq , however, is incorrect. It’s not   60 per 100,000. It’s 1,320 per 100,000. Additionally, the   death rate of U.S. soldiers in Iraq has not been just “gun related.”   Many have been killed in other ways such as through roadside bombs. So the whole point of   the email falls to the floor. updated 07/17/09 ","War"

"," The prayer requests for a group of U.S. Marines deployed in Afghanistan who have suffered heavy losses are real but some of the details regarding the casualty numbers are inaccurate, according to a December 4, 2010 article in the Salem-News . The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines known as “Darkhorse” is based out of Camp Pendleton in Southern California.  The unit is currently deployed in Afghanistan and has suffered losses of 13 members since October of 2010.

"Pam Foster commentary on Islam-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doug-patton/"," The eRumor is said to be an email written by Pam Foster of Atlanta and sent to a family member serving in Iraq, presumably in the U.S.armed forces.  It is a pointed commentary on Islamic terrorists and the mindset that promotes and supports them. "," This was not written by Pam Foster of Atlanta.  She was apparently a person who merely quoted a portion of the original commentary and it got circulated as though she had written it. TruthOrFiction contacted the person who wrote the original article, columnist Doug Patton.  His daily column of social and political commentary is seen in several newspapers and on several websites. The comments in the Pam Foster email were from a column he wrote for publication on June 6, 2005, the original of which is below. Doug Patton Column of June 6, 2005 First, Newsweek pulled a Dan Rather on us, running a fabricated story just because they wanted it to be true. They told the world that an American guard at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center had ripped pages from a prisoner’s Koran and flushed it down a toilet. As a result, innocent people died when practitioners of Islam rioted in protest in Afghanistan . Oops, said Newsweek, it seems we can’t back up our story. Oh well, it’s probably true; we just can’t prove it. The lie heard round the world about the flushed Koran has caused convulsions in the Bush Administration and forced the Pentagon to launch an investigation of unfounded allegations contained in an unsubstantiated story. The results of said investigation are now in, and it seems there are at least five incidents of “mishandling” of the Koran at Gitmo. Well, guess what? I DON’T CARE! Are we fighting a war on terror or aren’t we? Was it or was it not started by Islamic people who brought it to our shores on September 11, 2001? Were people from all over the world, mostly Americans, not brutally murdered that day, in downtown Manhattan , across the Potomac from our nation’s capitol and in a field in Pennsylvania ? Did nearly three thousand men, women and children die a horrible, burning death that day, or didn’t they? And I’m supposed to care that a copy of the Koran was “desecrated” when an overworked American soldier kicked it or got it wet? Well, I don’t. I don’t care at all. I’ll start caring when Osama bin Laden turns himself in and repents for incinerating all those innocent people on 9/11. I’ll care about the Koran when the fanatics in the Middle East start caring about the Holy Bible, the mere possession of which is a crime in Saudi Arabia . I’ll care when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi tells the world he is sorry for hacking off Nick Berg’s head while Berg screamed through his gurgling, slashed throat. I’ll care when the cowardly so-called “insurgents” in Iraq come out and fight like men instead of disrespecting their own religion by hiding in mosques. I’ll care when the mindless zealots who blow themselves up in search of nirvana care about the innocent children within range of their suicide bombs. I’ll care when the American media stops pretending that their First Amendment liberties are somehow derived from international law instead of the United States Constitution’s Bill of Rights. I’ll care when Clinton-appointed judges stop ordering my government to release photos of the abuses at Abu Ghraib, which are sure to set off the Islamic extremists just as Newsweek’s lies did a few weeks ago. In the meantime, when I hear a story about a brave marine roughing up an Iraqi terrorist to obtain information, know this: I don’t care. When I see a fuzzy photo of a pile of naked Iraqi prisoners who have been humiliated in what amounts to a college hazing incident, rest assured that I don’t care. When I see a wounded terrorist get shot in the head when he is told not to move because he might be booby-trapped, you can take it to the bank that I don’t care. When I hear that a prisoner, who was issued a Koran paid for by my tax dollars, is complaining that his holy book is being “mishandled,” you can absolutely believe in your heart of hearts that I don’t care. And oh, by the way, I’ve noticed that sometimes it’s spelled “Koran” and other times “Quran.” Well, Jimmy Crack Corn and — you guessed it — I don’t care! ","War"

The article said the reason for the decision by the U.S. Government not to equip the Afghan Air Force with U.S. made helicopters is because the Afghan pilots “were not trained to fly American-built helicopters.”  The chief of Afghanistan’s air corps, General Mohammed Dawran, said that the learning curve would be too great as “most of the pilots were in their 40s and set in their ways.” Posted 06/22/13 ","War"
