"Video Shows Muslim Woman Buying Soda with Food Stamps-Truth! & Unproven!","2016-10-03 10:46:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/video-shows-muslim-woman-buying-soda-food-stamps/"," A viral video shows a woman wearing hijab head covering loading a cart load of soda into a car as a man accuses her of using fraudulent food stamps to buy the soda so that it could be re-sold in a convenience store. "," The video clearly shows a woman loading soda into the back of a car, and she admits to purchasing it with food stamps — but claims that she illegally obtained the food stamps and planned to re-sell the soda can’t be proven. The video went viral in early October 2016 after it shared by a Facebook account operated by Vidmax , a said that says it posts “breaking news and hard hitting videos on important subjects such as war, American politics and social issues.” Within days of being re-posted on Vidmax’s Facebook page, the video of the woman loading soda into her car had been viewed more than 19 million times. The video sparked outrage about SNAP benefits (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), racial profiling, religious expression, integration, and other social issues. The video shows a woman and man loading a cartload of soda into a Lexus with New York registration outside a supermarket. The man recording the video opens by accusing the pair of food stamp fraud, saying, “You take our tax money, then you buy a bunch of pop, then you sell it at a gas station.” The woman seems to respond, “You don’t now my story, we really don’t own a store…” but it’s hard to make out exactly what she says. The exchange continues: Cameraman: They just bought all this pop with food stamps. Woman: These are our food stamps, you can’t tell me what to do with my card. Camera Man: It’s fraud. Woman: How is it fraud? Because I went in there and bought all this pop for myself? That’s stereotyping, you’re saying because I’m Arabian … Camera Man: I don’t know what you are, I don’t care. Woman: Ok then, shut the f*ck up. Camera Man: What’s your name? Woman: My name is f*ck America. Camera Man: Then go back to where you came from then. Woman: Detroit? I was born in Detroit…. The cameraman later says that he’s a lawyer and works for the state. However, because he doesn’t provide his name or a job title, it’s impossible to verify his identity. It’s also impossible to verify his claim that woman purchased the soda using fraudulent EBT cards and plans to re-sell it based solely on the video. There have been a number of credible reports of similar EBT scams being committed in recent years, however. In 2016, a Worcester woman named Vida Ofori Causey was sentenced to a year in prison for committing $3.6 million in food stamp fraud, according to a Department of Justice release : Causey was the owner and operator of J&W Aseda Plaza, a convenience store on Main Street in Worcester.  From April 2010 to October 2014, Causey conspired with others to commit SNAP fraud by purchasing SNAP benefits from recipients rather than exchanging them for food.  Causey purchased the benefits at a discounted value of approximately fifty cents for every SNAP dollar.  By so doing, Causey caused the USDA to electronically deposit into a bank account she controlled the full face value of the SNAP benefits fraudulently obtained.  To provide customers with cash for the SNAP benefits, Causey used the cash she received from customers wishing to utilize MoneyGram services.  In order to cover those transactions, she transferred money from the account where her SNAP funds were electronically deposited into the account she used for her MoneyGram business. Then, in August 2016, the owner of a Bufallo, New York, deli was held on $2 million bail on accusations that he carried out a similar scam, an ABC affiliate reports : Ahmed Alshami, 37, is charged with criminal possession of public benefit cards, misuse of food stamps and criminal use of a public benefit card for defrauding the welfare system. Alshami is the owner and operator of IGA Express Mart, a corner deli at 271 Ludington in the City of Buffalo. According to the Erie County District Attorney’s Office, between October 9, 2014 and March 21, 2016 Alshami is accused of buying EBT (food stamp) cards from people willing to trade them for cash. He usually paid people half of what the cards are worth. So, these types of food stamp frauds do exist — we just can’t prove that the woman capture in the video was committing it based only on the video evidence. We’ll update this report with any new developments. ","Miscellaneous"
"Chiefs Owner Clark Hunt Speech on National Anthem Protests-Incorrect Attribution!","2016-10-03 10:01:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/chiefs-owner-clark-hunt-national-anthem-protests/"," Clark Hunt, the owner and CEO of the Kansas City Chiefs, told coaches, players and staff that they are “paid performers on a stage” and ordered them to stand during the national anthem. "," Clark Hunt is the latest NFL team owner that this fiery locker room speech about standing for the playing of the national anthem has been falsely attributed to. These posts began circulating in response to San Francisco 49ers Colin Kapernick’s decision to sit or kneel during the national anthem in protest of social issues, and of the treatment of black men by the criminal justice system in particular. Numerous players around the league joined Kaepernick’s protest in the opening weeks of the 2016 NFL season. You can find a complete list of them here. Rumors that Clark Hunt had called a team meeting in which he sternly told his coaches and players that they were “paid performers on a stage” and “that field is my stage” began circulating toward the end of September 2016: Clark Hunt, CEO and Owner of the Kansas City #Chiefs called a meeting with all of his Coaches, Players and field staff and firmly told them, “You are all simply paid performers on a stage and that field is my stage! You will stand, with your hand over your heart and with respect, when our Country’s National Anthem is being played or you will no longer be a Kansas City Chief, a Coach for the Kansas City Chiefs or have any association with the Chiefs Organization! I will immediately fire you, no matter who you are! You can make your political statements off the field, but why you’re employed by me and I’m signing your check, I demand that you make our fans proud and not embarrass them.” The post was widely circulated on social media, but it didn’t come from Hunt. We investigated a previous version in which the speech was attributed to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones . We found that a Texas man named Richie Newberry, who is not affiliated with the Cowboys, wrote the locker room speech as a work of fiction. In reality, Clark Hunt has drawn scrutiny from critics of the national anthem protests because Hunt did not release Chiefs defense back Marcus Peters for protesting before an NFL game on September 18th . We couldn’t find any record of Hunt discussing his views on the player protests, but we can confirm that the locker room speech being circulated did not come from him.","Miscellaneous"

"," Charmin won’t be releasing pumpkin spice toilet paper this fall, contrary to a viral Facebook post. Questions about whether the pumpkin spice craze had “gone too far” seem to come up every fall as companies look to cash in on consumer love of pumpkin spice flavored and scented products. And the pumpkin spice craze has also become a popular target for parodies with people editing and photoshopping pumpkin spice versions of products that never should be (and aren’t) sold. In fact, Buzzfeed published a list of pumpkin spice products “that don’t exist and should never exist” in September 2014. Among the list was pumpkin spice toothpaste, pumpkin spice mouthwash, and, of course, pumpkin spice toilet paper supposedly made by Charmin. The idea of pumpkin spice toilet paper got more traction as fall approached in 2016 with a creatively photoshopped image of what a package of pumpkin spice toilet paper might look like: The photo was shared by a Facebook account operated by My Fridge Food , a website that allows visitors to generate recipes based on what food is already in their fridge. The post was likely shared as a spoof on the pumpkin spice craze, but taken out of context commenters on social believe it was true. They reacted with a mix of excitement, outrage and disbelief about pumpkin spice toilet paper. Rest assured, you won’t be see pumpkin spice toilet paper on store shelves this fall. ","Miscellaneous"
"NFL Fines Players for Wearing Commemorative 9/11 Cleats-Truth!","2016-09-12 10:04:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nfl-fines-players-wearing-911-commemorative-cleats/"," The NFL said that it would fine players for wearing cleats or other uniform accessories commemorating the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "," It’s true that the NFL warned players that they would be fined for wearing 9/11 tribute cleats on the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that rocked the country. However, it remains to be seen if the league will follow through on the threat. Public outcry over the NFL’s refusal to allow players to wear commemorative 9/11 cleats during the league’s opening weekend started after Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson revealed that a league official warned that he’d be fined for wearing the cleats in the lead up to the team’s game, the Tennessean reports . Williamson later released a press release that indicated he would auction off the 9/11 cleats rather than face an NFL fine for wearing them during a game: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Sept. 8, 2016 – PRLog — Titans’ Avery Williamson, has changed his plan to wear custom patriotic cleats to honor 9/11 victims and service men/woman during the home opener against the Vikings on September 11, 2016. Instead, he has chosen to raise more awareness through an auction partnered with Operation Warrior Wishes and Charity Buzz International, which is live now As for the cleats, they will be auctioned off for charity along with a meet & greet, two VIP tickets to a Tennessee Titans home game, and an autographed #54 jersey.  The proceeds of the auction posted will go to Operation Warrior Wishes. “9/11 is a time we can honor those who were lost, but also our service men/woman who were and are heroes,” Williamson said.  “I have a cousin in the Navy and many people in my life that serve this country. These cleats and this auction are a way to show honor,” Williamson expressed. “Avery is a stand up man for doing this for those who serve. The gesture speaks volumes about his respect for this country and the heroes of 9/11 and beyond, “said Craig Steichen, Founder of Operation Warrior Wishes, said. However, Williamson apparently changed his mind before the game. The Tennessean reported that Williamson wore the 9/11 cleats during the team’s week one game despite the NFL’s threat to fine him for doing so. New York Giants star wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz also wore the 9/11 cleats during the team’s week one game, “daring” the NFL to fine them for doing so, New York Daily News reports : Beckham’s special cleats were red, white and blue and emblazoned with the bust of a bald eagle. Cruz’s cleats had red and white stripes splashed with blue-star accents. Beckham’s shoes portrayed the Twin Towers, while Cruz’s had a fire-truck theme that featured his late father’s engine number. His dad was a smokeater in Paterson, NJ, before his death in 2007. The NFL never directly addressed reports that it had refused to allow players to wear 9/11 cleats, and it remains to be seen if the league would fine players for doing so because it hands down fines on the Tuesday or Wednesday following a game. In 2011, the NFL famously announced that it would not fine players for wearing 9/11 tribute gear on the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, with NFL spokesperson Greg Aiello saying, “We have extensive plans for Sunday to respectfully recognize the significance of the day,” the New York Daily News reports . However, the NFL has since become notoriously strict about its uniform policies under NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. A player whose mother died from breast cancer was fined multiple times in 2015 for wearing eye black that said, “Find a Cure” in her honor, for example. The NFL has sent a clear message that no matter how worthy a cause, it does not allow any unapproved uniform alterations to go unpunished. It should be noted, however, that the NFL donates money generated from fines to charities. The league said in a statement that players sometimes request which charities the money goes to, but the league tries to “stay universal” when handing out the money. That means fines handed down for 9/11 cleats could be donated to 9/11-related charities — or not. ","Miscellaneous"
"Seattle Seahawks Protest National Anthem-Fiction!","2016-09-12 08:40:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/seattle-seahawks-protest-national-anthem/"," Players on the Seattle Seahawks refused to stand for the national anthem in protest over social injustice. "," Players on various teams protested during the national anthem during the NFL’s opening weekend, but Seattle Seahawks players were not among them. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the movement when he sat during the National Anthem before his team’s third pre-season game. As week one of the NFL approached, there was speculation over which players or teams would protest in the same manner. Rumors that the Seattle Seahawks would sit during the national anthem ran rampant. David Marcus wrote in an article published by The Federalist that “the Seattle Seahawks are planning to protest the singing of the national anthem” before their season opener: Whatever the Seahawks have planned for Sunday, the silence from the NFL over this matter has been deafening. As of this writing, the NFL has made no statement on the Seahawks plans. In response to Kaepernick’s protest, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, “I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don’t live in a perfect society. …On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.” As it turns out, however, the Seahawks players, led by wide receiver Doug Baldwin, had planned to stand and lock arms during the singing of the national anthem in a display of unity, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports : As promised, the Seahawks offered no act of defiance during the national anthem before Sunday’s season opener against the Dolphins. Instead, players, coaches and other team personnel linked arm-in-arm in front of a jumbo American flag that stretched across CenturyLink Field. It came after President Barack Obama offered a video tribute on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Wide receiver Doug Baldwin said the team’s gesture was meant to honor victims of 9/11 and to support San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who this past month began protesting racial inequality and police violence against African-Americans by not standing during the Star-Spangled Banner. So, claims that the Seahawks had organized a protest for the team’s first game didn’t pan out. The team stood and locked arms in a show of unity. Players around the league did, however, choose to protest during the national anthem in various ways. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall kneeled on the sideline during the national anthem before the NFL’s Thursday night season opener — and he lost an endorsement deal with the Air Academy Federal Credit Union as a result. SB Nation has compiled a list of players that have sat or kneeled during the playing of the national anthem that can be viewed here. ","Miscellaneous"

West has written an open letter to Colin Kaepernick after the NFL quarterback sat during the playing of the national anthem in protest of racial and social issues. "," Allen B. West’s commentary appeared on his website August 28th under the headline, “Message from a Non-oppressed Black Man to Colin Kaepernick.” In the letter, West noted that the NFL had had released a statement encouraging but not requiring players to stand during the national anthem but had refused to require Dallas Cowboys to wear a helmet decal on their helmets in honor of slain Dallas police officers, continuing: This is the same NFL that said nothing when players from the then- St. Louis Rams displayed the false narrative symbol of “hands up, dont shoot” — which we know didn’t happen. I find it rather interesting that the NFL has no issue disrespecting law enforcement officers but only “encourages” players to respect the symbol of our nation, the American flag, and our anthem, the Star Spangled Banner. However, I would recommend a simple scripture from the wise King Solomon for Mr. Kaepernick, Proverbs 17:28 (NIV): “Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues.” West then goes on to note that Kaepernick is a biracial young man who was adopted and raised by white parents and now claims that America is oppressing blacks despite having two consecutive black attorneys general: First of all, let me clarify to you sir, you are a multi-millionaire “one-percenter” just because you can throw a ball and kiss your biceps. Men like Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Hank Aaron, Oscar Robertson, Ernie Davis, and Bernard King and Condredge Halloway of my alma mater were athletes who knew of oppression. You sir may certainly have the right to sit upon your “fourth point of contact” when the National Anthem is played but never forget, you live in a nation that has provided you the privilege to have that right. West then encouraged Kaepernick to ask Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee about racist public policies in the San Francisco Bay area: Or perhaps you can ask the two California senators, Boxer and Feinstein, about who doesn’t support better education opportunities for black children in the inner cities — school choice, vouchers, charter schools, home schooling. Perhaps you didn’t know Barack Obama was the one who cancelled the DC school voucher program for deserving young black children — talk about oppression.

LifeSiteNews Daily News, a website run by a Canadian pro-life non-profit group called Campaign Life Coalition, reported Maya Dillard Smith’s resignation from the ACLU’s Georgia chapter over its support of transgender bathroom use on May 31st. The story, which appeared under the headline “State Leader Quits ACLU After Daughters Were ‘Visibly Frightened’ by Men Using Women’s Restroom,” begins: The African-American woman who leads a state chapter of the ACLU has resigned, citing her own daughters’ “frightened” reaction to biological males using the women’s restroom. The organization’s increasing focus on legislating the transgender lobby’s concerns pushed Maya Dillard Smith, interim director of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, to tender her resignation. “I have shared my personal experience of having taken my elementary school age daughters into a women’s restroom when shortly after three transgender young adults, over six feet [tall] with deep voices, entered,” she wrote.

"Canadian Teen Finds Lost Mayan City With Google Maps-Disputed!","2016-05-12 12:59:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/canadian-teen-finds-lost-mayan-city-google-maps/"," A Canadian teenager found a lost Mayan city using Google Maps and a new method that matches stars to the location of temples in Central America. "," There’s currently no agreement among archaeologists and remote sensing experts as to whether a Canadian teenager actually found a long lost Mayan city using Google Maps, so we’re calling this one “disputed” for the time being. The story first appeared in Le Journal de Montreal , a French language newspaper based in Quebec, on May 7th under the headline, “A Teenager Discovers a Mayan City.” The story reports : Passionate Mayan for several years, he analyzed 22 Mayan constellations and realized that if he connected on a map the stars of the constellations, the shape of each corresponded to position 117 Mayan cities. No scientist had ever found such a correlation between the stars and the location of the Mayan cities. The genius of William, however, was to analyze a 23rd constellation. It contained three stars and only two cities matched on the card. According to his theory, so it should be a 118th Mayan city in a remote and inaccessible location in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Analyses from satellites in different space agencies have revealed that there was indeed a pyramid and thirty buildings at the precise location identified by the young man. The Journal had access to satellite images which we see different structures of what may be an ancient city. “Geometric shapes, such as squares or rectangles, appeared on these images, forms that can hardly be attributed to natural phenomena,” says remote sensing specialist at the University of New Brunswick, Dr. Armand LaRocque. The sensational story about an untrained teenager supposedly discovering a Mayan city that had eluded professional archaeologists quickly traveled around the world. By May 10th, the story appeared in the U.K.’s Telegraph under the headline, “Star Pupil Finds Lost Mayan City By Studying Ancient Charts of the Night Sky From His Bedroom.” That story reports : William took to Google Maps and projected that there must be another city hidden deep in the thick jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The Canadian Space Agency agreed to train its satellite telescopes on the spot and returned with striking pictures: what appears to be an ancient Mayan pyramid and dozens of smaller structures around it. If the satellite photographs are verified, the city would be among the largest Mayan population centers ever discovered. It fell to William Gadoury to christen the new city and he chose the name K’aak Chi, meaning Fire Mouth, and the teenager said he hoped to one day see the ruins with his own eyes. The tech site Gizmodo picked up the story from there , quoting a remote sensing specialist who said he believed that the satellite images showed man-made geometric shapes hidden beneath the jungle’s canopy: Taking this idea further, Gadoury contacted the Canadian Space Agency, who provided him with space-based images from NASA and JAXA. These satellite images revealed a batch of undeniably geometric structures hidden under the jungle canopy. Gadoury, along with Dr. Armand LaRocque, a remote sensing specialist from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, believe it’s an ancient Maya pyramid surrounded by 30 smaller structures. The teen has named the city—which has yet to be explored and verified—K’aak Chi, which means “Mouth of Fire.” If confirmed, it would be among the largest Maya cities ever discovered. LaRocque said the use of satellite images, as well as the contribution of digital image processing, helped to confirm the possible existence of this forgotten city. “Geometric shapes, such as squares or rectangles, appeared in these images, forms that can hardly be attributed to natural phenomenon,” LaRocque said. However, experts have since come forward calling the reports “false.” David Stuart, an anthropologist from the Mesoamerica Center-University of Texas at Austin, said on Facebook that he felt the need to debunk the story after the BBC picked it up. He called it “a terrible example of junk science hitting the internet in free-fall” in the post: Additionally, Thomas Garrison, an anthropologist and remote sensing specialist at the University of Southern California, said the objects in the satellite images were corn fields — not ancient relics of a Mayan city, Gizmodo reports: I applaud the young kid’s effort and it’s exciting to see such interest in the ancient Maya and remote sensing technology in such a young person. However, ground-truthing is the key to remote sensing research. You have to be able to confirm what you are identifying in a satellite image or other type of scene. In this case, the rectilinear nature of the feature and the secondary vegetation growing back within it are clear signs of a relic milpa. I’d guess its been fallow for 10-15 years. This is obvious to anyone that has spent any time at all in the Maya lowlands. I hope that this young scholar will consider his pursuits at the university level so that his next discovery (and there are plenty to be made) will be a meaningful one. So, considering that experts have weighed in on both sides of this story, we’re calling it “disputed” for the time being. We’ll post future updates about the Canadian teen’s findings here.

"Photo Shows Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi River Don’t Mix-Mostly Truth!","2016-04-29 13:38:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/photo-shows-gulf-mexico-mississippi-river-dont-mix/"," A photo that shows a clear line separating bright blue water from murky green water is rumored to show that water from the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi River don’t mix. "," Images and videos of a clear line separating blue and green water in the Gulf of Mexico are real — and they actually show an area where water from the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi River don’t mix. The area, which is called a “dead zone,” was located off the shore of Louisiana and Texas in the summer of 2015. It was caused by high levels of nutrient runoff into the Mississippi River that left the water emptying into the Gulf of Mexico with high levels of nitrogen. High levels of nitrogen lead to overgrowth of algae and other vegetation that sucks much of the oxygen from the water and kills fish. In 2015, when this video was posted, dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico were “above average,” the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports : The largest previous Gulf of Mexico dead zone was in 2002, encompassing 8,497 square miles. The smallest recorded dead zone measured 15 square miles in 1988. The average size of the dead zone over the past five years has been about 5,500 square miles, nearly three times the 1,900 square mile goal set by the Hypoxia Task Force in 2001 and reaffirmed in 2008. The hypoxic zone off the coast of Louisiana and Texas forms each summer threatening the ecosystem that supports valuable commercial and recreational Gulf fisheries. NOAA-funded research in the past decade shows hypoxia results in habitat loss, displacement of fish (including shrimp and croaker) from their preferred areas, and a decline in reproductive ability in some species. Dead zones change each year based on nutrient levels in the water, weather conditions and wind speed — so there’s not a permanent divide in the Gulf of Mexico between blue and green water. These rumor started with a YouTube video posted in November 2015 under the headline, “Mississippi River Rip in the Flesh,” that claims to display “A true showing of colors when the Gulf of Mexico meets the Mississippi River.” By April 2016, still shots from the video had made their way to Facebook and other social media platforms in a posts that claims, “The Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico. The two bodies of water never mix with each other; allowing the Gulf of Mexico to retain its clear, blue color. Simply Amazing!”: So, there are areas of the Gulf of Mexico where a clear divide between blue and green water can be seen. However, that line in the water isn’t permanent and constantly changes based on a number of factors. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly true. ","Miscellaneous"
"Edgar Allen Poe Wrote About the Death of Dick Parker-Truth!","2016-02-19 09:41:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/edgar-allen-poe-wrote-about-the-death-of-dick-parker/"," Edgar Allen Poe’s only complete novel, “Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket,” tells the story of a sailor named Dick Parker who was eaten by his crew after they ran out of provisions. Decades later, a sailor named Richard “Dick” Parker was actually killed and eaten by his crewmates after a storm nearly destroyed their ship. "," This one is true. Edgar Allen Poe wrote about Dick Parker’s (fictional) death in a novel published 46 years before a real sailor named Dick Parker died in the same way. “ Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket ” tells the story of two boys who hide aboard a whaling ship that sets out to sea. While the boys are hiding, the crew mutinies and many end up slaughtered. The boys team up with the only two remaining crewmembers, one being named Dick Parker. After they run out of food, they decided to draw straws to see which one of them will be killed and eaten to keep the others alive. And, you guessed it, Dick Parker draws the short straw and is eaten by his crewmates. An almost identical situation played out in 1883 — 46 years after the novel was published — when an unlucky sailor named Dick Parker was killed and eaten by his crewmembers. Their boat had been cast away in a storm 1,600 miles from the Cape of Good Hope. After they ran out of water, Dick Parker refused to drink his own urine for hydration and opted for seawater instead. That made him sick. Shortly after he fell into a coma, his crewmates, Thomas Dudley and Edwin Stephens, decided to murder and eat him, according to a summary of a criminal case brought against the men: That next day, the 25th of July, no vessel appearing, Dudley told Brooks that he had better go and have a sleep, and made signs to Stephens and Brooks that the boy had better be killed.  The prisoner Stephens agreed to the act, but Brooks dissented from it.  That the boy was then lying at the bottom of the boat quite helpless and extremely weakened by famine and by drinking sea water, and unable to make any resistance, nor did he ever assent to his being killed.  The prisoner Dudley offered a prayer asking forgiveness for them all if either of them should be tempted to commit a rash act, and that their souls might be saved.  That Dudley, with the assent of Stephens, went to the boy, and telling him that his time was come, put a knife into his throat and killed him then and there; that the three men fed upon the body and blood of the boy for four days; that on the fourth day after the act had been committed the boat was picked up by a passing vessel, and the prisoners were rescued, still alive, but in the lowest state of prostration. The big difference between the fictional and actual stories is that the crews didn’t draw straws to decide who would die in the actual story. Rather, Dick Smith’s crewmates decided he should die because they both had families waiting for them back home. After Dudley and Stephens survived the ordeal, they were found guilty of murder in Parker’s death and sentenced to death. ","Miscellaneous"
"Texas Man Forced to Remove Flag Muslims Found Threatening-Fiction!","2016-02-11 12:10:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/texas-man-forced-to-remove-flag-muslims-found-threatening/"," A Texas man was forced to remove an American flag draped over a patio railing outside his apartment complex because Muslim neighbors complained that they found it threatening. "," A Texas man was told to take down an American flag hung outside his apartment, but the complex manager said complaints from Muslim neighbors had nothing to do with it. The story dates back to 2014, but it was re-reported as “breaking” news in early 2016 by the Supreme Patriot, a website known for publishing anti-Islamic and anti-Democratic news stories: In an interview with KHOU, Duy Tran told reporters that he has friends who have died for this country, and so he decided to hang the flag from his balcony, after moving into his new apartment in Webster, Texas. Apparently there are guidelines and hanging Old Glory doesn’t meet community standards, however what really set Tran off is what the apartment complex manager told him; “What really stunned me is that she said it’s a threat towards the Muslim community,” Tran told reporters. “I’m not a threat toward nobody.” Within a week, the Supreme Patriot story had been shared more than 16,000 times. Those who shared it were likely unaware that the story was from 2014, and that the manager of the apartment complex has since come forward to dispute the claim. KHOU reported on June 19, 2014 , that Duy Tran had told the station he was told to take down the American flag because Muslims found it offensive. But the apartment complex manager came forward to refute those claims in a story published on June 24, 2014 : On Tuesday the complex s corporate CEO Jenifer Paneral responded. There was never a statement that the flag was a threat to any religious community, or to anyone at any point in time, she said. When we first tried talking to a property manager last week, she gave KHOU 11 News a written statement, refused to answer any questions and had police escort us off the property. Paneral is now calling that handling unfortunate. She said this comes down to, a clear violation of our policy. That s because she said the flag was too big to hang off the balcony railing, where it could fall on someone below. Paneral said the property manager explained that to Tran. She did refer to other communities, other religious groups in that explanation, but it was just an example of the types of things that were hanging over the balcony, said Paneral. But at no time was there ever a statement that it was a threat to any community. Tran is standing by his version, that he was told the flag was a threat to the Muslim community and it had to come down from his balcony. In the end, Tran compromised. Because the community didn’t allow residents to hang flags from patio railings, Tran moved the flag to an outside porch wall, which didn’t break the community’s rules. That makes the idea that he was told to remove it because residents found it threatening pretty shaky. If a resident found a flag on a railing threatening, they would find a flag on an outside wall threatening, too. Media reports also said a large American flag was on public display at the entrance of the apartment community, which means flags weren’t banned there. ","Miscellaneous"
"Lawn Jockey Statues are Racist-Disputed!","2016-01-29 11:54:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lawn-jockey-statues-are-racist/"," Lawn jockey statues depicting slaves holding lanterns are racist. "," It’s unclear where exactly black lawn jockey statues came from, and what they’re meant to represent. Lawn jockey supporters argue that these “black footman statues” are works of Americana art. The other side of the argument goes that all lawn jockey statues are a painful and racist celebration of America’s darkest chapter: slavery. There’s no clear answer, but we can explore the history of lawn jockey statues to offer some perspective. One theory goes that lawn jockey statues symbolize an African-American boy named Jocko Graves. Legend has it, Graves heroically died helping George Washington return from battle during the Revolutionary War, according to Ferris State University : “The story begins the icy night in December 1776 when General George Washington decided to cross the Delaware River to launch a surprise attack on the British forces at Trenton. Jocko Graves, a twelve-year-old African-American, sought to fight the Redcoats, but Washington deemed him too young and ordered him to look after the horses, asking Jocko to keep a lantern blazing along the Delaware so the company would know where to return after battle. Many hours later, Washington and his men returned to their horses that were tied up to Graves, who had frozen to death with the lantern still clenched in his fist. Washington was so moved by the young boy’s devotion to the revolutionary cause he commissioned a statue of the ‘Faithful Groomsman’ to stand in Graves’s honor at the general’s estate in Mount Vernon.” But Mount Vernon librarian Ellen McCallister Clark debunked that account, writing in a letter that there’s no historical account of a “Jocko Graves,” nor of any 12-year-old boy dying along the Delaware River while holding a lantern for George Washington. Another theory goes that the lawn jockey statues were used to guide fleeing slaves along the Underground Railroad. Charles L. Blockson, the great-grandson of a slave who escaped to Canada, learned that colored ribbons were placed on long jockey statutes to signal safety or danger : In a 1984 National Geographic cover story on the underground railroad, Blockson told how the wife of U.S. District Judge Benjamin Piatt had tied a flag to a lawn jockey as a signal to fleeing slaves that it was safe to stop there. But skeptics argue that escaping slaves would have moved at night, making them unable to see different colored ribbons in the darkness. It’s not clear what role, if any, lawn jockeys played in the Underground Railroad. There are different styles of lawn jockey statues, too. Older versions of the statues appeared to be caricatures of slaves; they were painted in black face and were stooped in “servile” positions. Another version features non-caricatured African-Americans dressed as slaves. Another version, known as  “Cavalier spirit,” depict upright, white lawn jockeys. Again, there’s no clear answer for where lawn jockey statues came from, or what they represent. That’s why we’re classifying this one as “disputed.” ","Miscellaneous"

"," This one is true. John Franklin Stephens wrote an open letter to Anne Coulter after she called President Obama a “retard” on Twitter during the 2012 presidential election. The controversy started when Ann Coulter tweeted , “I highly approve of Romney’s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard,” during the presidential election. Ann Coulter later refused to apologize for her use of the word “retard.” In an appearance on CNN, Coulter said that she wasn’t referring to someone with Down syndrome when she used the word, and that she had nothing to apologize about: “I was not referring to someone with Down syndrome. I was referring to the president of the United States. I didn’t call the president a Down syndrome child. I used the word retard the way some people use idiot, cretin, moron and the rest of them, which were all once technical terms, and I had it with the language police.” Ann Coulter’s non-apology didn’t sit well with John Franklin Stephens, a 30-year-old Special Olympics athlete with Down syndrome. In an open letter to Coulter that appeared on a Special Olympics WordPress blog, Franklin Stephens wrote : Come on Ms. Coulter, you aren’t dumb and you aren’t shallow.  So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? I’m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public’s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow.  I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you.  In fact it has taken me all day to figure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night. I thought first of asking whether you meant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people like you, but rose above it to find a way to succeed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have. Then I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle to be thoughtful about everything he says, as everyone else races from one snarkey sound bite to the next. Finally, I wondered if you meant to degrade him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are – and much, much more. After I saw your tweet, I realized you just wanted to belittle the President by linking him to people like me.  You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV. I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much. Come join us someday at Special Olympics.  See if you can walk away with your heart unchanged. A friend you haven’t made yet, John Franklin Stephens Global Messenger Special Olympics Virginia John Franklin Stephens also appeared on CNN to talk about Coulter’s use of the word retard.

"Easter Island Heads Have Bodies Buried Beneath Them-Truth!","2015-07-29 13:36:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/easter-island-heads-have-bodies-buried-beneath-them/"," The famous Easter Island heads have bodies buried beneath the Earth. "," This one is true. Archaeologists discovered that a number of Easter Island head statues have torsos that were buried over time by eroded soil. Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a Polynesian island located in the East Pacific. Ancient natives of Rapa Nui carved 887 head statutes that have puzzled people for centuries. But discoveries by the Easter Island Statue Project offer new answers. Jo Anne Van Tilburg, a UCLA research assistant and the director of the Easter Island Statue Project, said she was “blindsided” when excavations revealed bodies buried beneath some of the head statutes: “But now I quite understand it, because most of the photographs that are widely available on the Internet, and certainly in books, deal only with the very photogenic statues that are located on the slopes of the quarry in which they were carved.” Buried to mid-torso, she said, the statues (which the Rapa Nui call moai, pronounced MO-eye) “do appear to be heads only. And, indeed, over the years, the statues were usually referred to as the Easter Island heads. But now people are aware they have bodies. I think that’s fabulous. I love it when good science can be turned into public information so quickly.” The base of the Easter Island head statues held even more surprises. Archaeologists found crescent-shaped etchings in the stones, red pigment and human remains, UCLA reports : The excavation team also found about 800 grams of natural red pigment — nearly two pounds — in the burial hole, along with a human burial. Van Tilburg believes the pigment was used to paint the statues, just as the Rapa Nui used pigment to paint their bodies for certain ceremonies. The unusually large amount of pigment found indicates that it might have been used by a priest or chief, perhaps as part of mortuary practice, she said. Human bones were found throughout the dig, indicating that people buried their dead around the statues. It’s believed that the Easter Island head statutes date back to 700 AD. Most of them were carved between 1000 and 1650. Many were knocked over during clan wars from 1600-1700, and others have been moved, the website World Mysteries reports : Scholars are unable to definitively explain the function and use of the moai statues. It is assumed that their carving and erection derived from an idea rooted in similar practices found elsewhere in Polynesia but which evolved in a unique way on Easter Island. Archaeological and iconographic analysis indicates that the statue cult was based on an ideology of male, lineage-based authority incorporating anthropomorphic symbolism. The statues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. But they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. The discovery of bodies buried beneath some of the Easter Island head adds another twist to the island’s mysterious past. ","Miscellaneous"

"," ESPN said that there is no “runner up” for its Arthur Ashe Courage Award, so this claim appears to be false. The rumor that Army Sgt. Noah Galloway, a double amputee CrossFit athlete who gained national attention after competing on “Dancing with the Stars,” was the runner up to Caitlyn Jenner for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award started with a tweet by Boston Herald columnist and radio host Gerry Callahan. Callahan tweeted a picture of Galloway with the comment, “Caitlyn Jenner wins Arthur Ashe Courage Award. And the runner up is…” Gerry Callahan told the Boston Globe that “anyone who knows me, my radio show or my history Twitter,” would know that the tweet was meant to be sarcastic, not factual. The Boston Globe reports that Callahan continued: “It wasn’t until it made it around the globe that it got a little out of hand. I laughed. I was glad to see the Lauren Hill fans jump on board. They should be pissed. She would have been a great choice. I personally would have chosen Pete Frates (to win the award). But would have had no problem if the honor had gone to Lauren Hill or Noah Galloway. You can admire Jenner all you want, but to put Caitlyn in the discussion with those real-life heroes is just silly. ESPN should give itself an award for over-the-top pandering.” Gerry Callahan’s tweet that Noah Galloway was the runner up to Caitlyn Jenner touched off a firestorm on social media sites. ESPN quickly weighed in and said that the award didn’t have a “runner up.” It also added in a statement : “The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action. Sometimes that courage is demonstrated over the course of a lifetime and sometimes it is demonstrated in a single act that shines a light on an important contemporary issue. At all times, there are many worthy candidates. This year, we are proud to honor Caitlyn Jenner embracing her identity and doing so in a public way to help move forward a constructive dialogue about progress and acceptance.” Some argue that ESPN still chose Caitlyn Jenner for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award over Noah Galloway, even if the sports network doesn’t officially name a “runner up.” The National Report commented that: “…Galloway wasn’t the ‘runner-up.’ The reality, however, is even worse — there’s no evidence that a magnificently courageous man like Galloway was even considered for the award. And if he was indeed considered (or another worthy recipient like Lauren Hill, a college basketball player who died this year after a terrible battle with cancer) and passed over for Jenner, it’s even more absurd.” Based on the fact that ESPN has never before named a runner up for the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, and the fact that there’s no way to tell who the sports network considered or didn’t consider for the award, we’re classifying this one as fiction.

"," A fake news website is behind this hoax. An article that appeared at the World News Daily Report website claimed that the Cuban Coast Guard had found an unmanned ship believed to be the SS Cotopaxi that went missing in the Bermuda Triangle 90 years ago: “The Cuban authorities spotted the ship for the first time on May 16, near a restricted military zone, west of Havana. They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew, and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it. When they reached it, they were surprised to find that the ship was actually a nearly 100-year old steamer identified as the Cotopaxi, a name famously associated with the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. There was no one on board and the ship seemed to have been abandoned for decades, suggesting that this could actually be the tramp freighter that disappeared in 1925. An exhaustive search of the ship led to the discovery of the captain’s logbook. It was, indeed, associated with the Clinchfield Navigation Company, the owners of the SS Cotopaxi, but hasn’t brought any clue concerning what happened to the ship over the last 90 years.” Within days, the story had been shared more than 40,000 times on social media sites. People who were duped into believing that the story was true speculated that pirates could be behind the missing ship if its cargo was missing, and that it seemed unlikely an unmanned ship could survive in the ocean for 90 years.

I would like to understand the details of this incidence.” However, World News Daily Report is notorious for publishing fake news stories that trick readers into believing that they’re real.

Companies that are based in China are assigned a three-digit company prefix between 690-699. But there’s a catch. The company pre-fix doesn’t identify a product’s country of origin. It identifies the origin of the company that made the product. That means if you buy a product with a U.S. company prefix (1-19, 30-39 or 60-139), there’s a chance that the product was manufactured outside the U.S., and possibly in China.

"ABC News Bans Flag Lapel Pins – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-04-20 01:58:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abcflag/"," ABC News executives told reporters not to wear American flag lapel pins because the network should remain as neutral as possible. "," Rumors that ABC News has banned American flag lapel pins have been swirling ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim was based in truth at one time, but it has drifted more toward fiction over the years. The 9/11 attacks resulted in a wave of patriotism that had not been seen in decades. The shared enthusiasm for the country and flag were widespread. It created difficulties for reporters, however, who try to professionally earn and keep people’s trust by avoiding personal partisan displays while reporting in the news. Many media outlets struggled to preserve their image as journalists while at the same time appearing unpatriotic in a time of crisis. Some journalists elected to wear American flag lapel pins on air, and the debate started. CBS, NBC and CNN did not have a lapel pin policy in place before or after 9/11, the Orlando Sentinel reports . Reporters for those stations regularly wore American flag lapel pins on air while covering 9/11. When word got out that ABC News had “banned American flag lapel pins,” the network became a lightning rod for criticism. However, the eRumor began to drift away from the truth almost immediately. The network never specifically singled out American flag lapel pins — it prohibited its reporters from wearing any lapel pin on the air. David Westin, the former president of ABC News, said in a 2012 interview with CNN that he made the decision to stick with the no-lapel pin policy in the days that followed 9/11: “It came up while I was in the control room. As you’ll recall, we were on the air for about four and a half days straight — 24 hours, seven days a week with no commercial interruption or anything else. There was constant reporting coming in during that time and we were having to make decisions about what to do and what not to do … They came to us and said, ‘We are being asked why we’re not wearing lapel pins,’ because a number of other outlets, particularly cable news, were. Fox News in particular had integrated the American flag into the backdrop and bumpers and teases and everything else. And we’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort. The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly, ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision.” Ever since, the stance that ABC News takes on all lapel pins — including American flag lapel pins — has been widely misunderstood. Under the policy, reporters are simply asked not to wear lapel pins. What happens if they do anyway? Not much, apparently. Terry Moran, who covered the Bush administration for ABC News in 2001, chose to defy the network and wore a flag lapel pin . He still climbed the network’s ranks over the next decade and became co-anchor of the show “Nightline.” This eRumor has resurfaced a number of times over the years. After President Obama temporarily stopped wearing an American flag lapel pin in 2007, ABC News was accused of “following the president’s lead” in a series of viral emails. Considering the long standing lapel pin policy at ABC News, that claim is false. Then, in early 2015, another viral email claimed that ABC News had just ordered reporters not to wear “lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia.” That email was outdated and stretched the truth about the policy to begin with.

Rather, a private company announced that it would set the water slide up in Detroit. And Detroit isn’t shutting off anyone’s water because of the water slide, either. A CBS Detroit report from November of 2014 said the city had disconnected water service to 31,300 customers who were behind on their bills.

"," This email covers only part of the story. Women’s rights had been an issue throughout the early history of the United States along with the abolition of slavery. There is a complete timeline posted on the Library of Congress web site in a section dedicated to The National American Woman’s Suffrage Association collection consisting of 167 books, pamphlets and other artifacts documenting the suffrage campaign.  The Library of Congress timeline begins with Abigail Adams who wrote a memo to her husband in 1776 to remind the Continental Congress while they were drafting the Constitution of the United States to “remember the ladies.” It wasn’t until after the civil war and the abolishment of slavery in the US that the women’s movement began to gain momentum as the next battle for civil rights. In 1866 Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the American Equal Rights Association, an organization dedicated to the goal of universal suffrage. In 1872 Susan B. Anthony was arrested and fined $100 for trying to enter a polling place to vote for Ulysses S Grant.  Former slave, Sojourner Truth showed up at a polling booth in Battle Creek, Michigan, demanding a ballot but was turned away. According to the case posted in the University of Kansas City Law School Anthony never paid her fine and “no serious effort was made by the government to collect it.” In 1878 A Woman Suffrage Amendment  was introduced in the United States Congress proposing “The right of citizens to vote shall not be abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex” but was not ratified by Congress until August 18, 1920. In 1913 Teddy Roosevelt adopted the woman’s suffrage cause as a plank on his Bull Moose Party platform when he ran for a third term for President of the United States. Throughout the course of time there were many groups and conventions promoting the right to vote for women. Lucy Burns and Alice Paul organized the Congressional Union eventually changing the name to the National Women’s Party which got them noticed.  Their tactics were more radical and militant than the groups that preceded them and included hunger strikes, picketing the White House, and engaging in other forms of civil disobedience to publicize the suffrage cause. In 1917 members of the movement staged a massive protest in front of the Whitehouse in Washington DC. Hundreds of women were arrested on charges of “obstructing sidewalk traffic.”  Many were convicted and sentenced to prison at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia. In 2004 HBO (Home Box Office) produced and released the docudrama “Iron Jawed Angels” staring Hillary Swank as Alice Paul and Frances O’Connor as Lucy Burns.  It gives an account of the history of the movement and does show Lucy Burns , who went on a hunger strike during her incarceration, being forced fed through a tube down her throat. Doris Stevens (1892-1963) wrote her firsthand account of treatment and conditions in which the suffragists were held at the Occoquan Workhouse in 1917 in a book called “Jailed for Freedom”  and it can be found at the Gutenberg Project website, a collection of writing that were produced by tens of thousands of volunteers. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Susan B. Anthony Dollar Coin Act into law making her the first woman to be honored by having her likeness appear on a circulating United States coin.

"FEMA Corps Team Members Are the Modern Day Hitler Youth-Fiction!","2015-03-23 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-corps-hitler-youth/"," This is a forwarded email that contains an article that compares a group of American youths who recently graduated from the FEMA Corps program to Hitler Youth.  The email also alleges that the Department of Homeland Security is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition. "," The origin of the eRumor comes from an October 7, 2012 article from the Whiteout Press but these are the ramblings of someone who appears to know very little about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and World War II history of Nazi Germany. According to their website, FEMA Corps is a program that creates a pool of trained team members ranging from ages 18 to 24 to assist in disaster recovery.   The mission of this program is to establish a unit of 1,600 service corps members dedicated to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The benefit of this program is to prepare participants “for careers in emergency management and other related fields, building depth in the emergency management community.”  The first 480 members began training in August 2012 and became ready for deployment in September 2012.  The next training program begins in Winter 2013. FEMA Corps members are compensated for their time. According to the FAQ on their website, “FEMA Corps members receive a living allowance of approximately $4,000 for the 10 months of service (about $200 every two weeks before taxes), housing, meals, limited medical benefits” and members can receive up to an additional $400 a month for childcare.   After the first 10 month term of service there is an option to extend for a second year. Comparison to Hitler Youth Hitler Youth were created in the 1920’s and targeted boys and girls from the ages of 10 to 18. It began as a voluntary program but in 1936, after Adolf Hitler came into power the program became compulsory.   According to the Historylearingsite , the “task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service. For girls, the organization prepared them for motherhood.”    Members of FEMA Corps do not fall into to this age range nor are they trained or prepared for the military. The photo in the forwarded email depicting a young team of FEMA Corps members fully armed and ready to respond is inaccurate. According to a May 13, 2009 article in the New York Times the group in the photo are Explorer Scouts in a simulated counter terrorism training exercise, which occurred in California’s Imperial County under the leadership of local law enforcement and Border Patrol. The article said, “The Explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence — an intense ratcheting up of one of the group’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.” DHS Armament? The writer of the eRumor also alleged that the DHS is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition.  The DHS oversees agencies that conduct  law enforcement, military missions, and immigration enforcement. In a February 14, 2013 article by Fox News , it was disclosed that DHS training centers have used as much as 15 million rounds annually for training exercises and practice on shooting ranges. The article also said that the DHS plans to purchase 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling it “the federal government’s second largest criminal investigative agency.” But ICE is not the only armed agency under the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Secret Service, the intelligence agency that was originally under the Department of the Treasury has the responsibility of protecting the President and dignitaries.  This agency has been under the blanket of the DHS since March 1, 2003.   One agency under the DHS that could be considered to be a major user of weapons and ammunition is the United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is on loan to the DHS from the Department of Transportation and has enough fire power to protect U.S. ports, chase and apprehend pirates and smugglers and assist in the protection of our military assets and facilities in the Persian Gulf. The USCG lists 212 aircraft, various vessels ranging in boats from 18 feet to 47 feet along with a fleet of cutters ranging from 65 feet to 179 feet.  The USCG also performs search and rescue for mariners in peril on the water. The USCG H-65 Dolphin helicopter in the photo above is usually armed with Single 7.62mm M240B/H machine gun, a 7.62mm shoulder-fired precision weapon and a .50-caliber shoulder-fired precision weapon. USCG Cutter Stratton pictured above is one of the newest ships in the fleet can carry USCG Helicopters and has an armament of 57mm Bofors Gun, 1 Phalanx, a CIWS 1B 20mm, four 50 caliber machine guns, as well as two M240B light machine guns.  The cutter is also capable of launching 25 Foot Defender Class Boats with gun mounts both forward and aft. Other agencies under the DHS, according to their organizational chart , are U.S. Customs & Boarder Protection, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, and Transportation Security Administration.   Each agency has members who carry and are trained to use weapons. Special Armored Vehicles The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV or “Humvee”) are real and some agencies receive training on these armored vehicles designated for Special Response Teams by the DHS.  The above photo shows members of  U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement in a special training exercise involving armored vehicles. Also, FEMA is the training agency for first responders from the local level to agencies under the DHS.   So that all agencies speak the same language at the scene of a disaster the Incident Command System was developed for all levels of government as well as private sector and by many nongovernmental organizations. updated 2/14/13 ","Miscellaneous"

"," TruthOrFiction.com has checked court records and news archives for the cities mentioned, and have not found any documentation for any of these stories. When this eRumor started circulating, we didn’t find anything that resembled the “Stella Awards,” but there is a group that has now started such an award at http://www.stellaawards.com . The court case involving Stella Liebeck is true and is widely known because of it being the little old lady who got millions because of what seemed like a small incident. She spilled hot coffee on herself after the drive-through at a McDonald’s in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson’s car. The spill caused severe burns over 6 percent of her body. She spent a week in the hospital, underwent several skin drafts, and ended up with permanent scarring on 15 percent of her body. According to the Washington State Trial Lawyer’s Association, Liebeck sued McDonalds only after the company refused to pay her medical expenses. The WSTLA says her bills added up to $11,000, but McDonalds offered to pay only $800. A mediator recommended a $250,000 settlement, which McDonald’s turned down. One of the issues in the trial was that Liebeck’s lawyers said there had been several hundred similar cases that McDonald’s had ignored and that the company had refused to reduce the temperature of the coffee machines. A jury gave Stella Liebeck $160,000 but also fined McDonald’s a punitive damage of $2.7 million. A judge later reduced that amount to $480,000 then McDonald’s settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. ","Miscellaneous"

SMMT source cited by GoodCarBadCar.net is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the U.K . Recovery in the United States has also been steady. CNN reported in January 2014 that U.S. car sales topped 15 million vehicles in 2013 for the first time since 2007. In July 2013, Business Week reported that 3.27 million new cars were sitting in lots — the highest level in five years. But manufacturers intentionally boosted inventory levels because of increased sales and consumer interest, according to the article. Sales in Spain were in fact down. Europe’s fifth largest automaker sold 1.6 million cars in 2007 and 700,000 in 2012, according to the 2013 edition of European Vehicle Market Statistics . The New York Times also reported in March 2014 that Russian auto sales were expected to be low despite foreign investment. The reason, however, is the crisis in Ukraine and not lack of consumer interest in new cars, according to the article. Posted 5/14/14 ","Miscellaneous"

Earlier versions of the eRumor claimed that the fallen soldier’s name was Peter Mallory, and that Mallory was posthumously awarded the Silver Medal for his courageous service. Those claims were likely removed from the latest versions of the eRumor because they can easily be proven false. A Washington Post database of all the soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan does not include anyone named Mallory. The name “Mallory” also does not appear in a database operated by the website HomeofHeroes.com that lists every recipient of the Silver Star in the wars on terror.

The photo shows a black lab that suffered a broken spine and had to be put to sleep. The facts of the eRumor also do not make sense. Organizations like Dogs on Deployment and Guardian Angels for Soldier’s Pet help deployed veterans find temporary or forever homes for their dogs and pets.

"," Update 7/2/14 – The Supreme Court made a ruling on June 30, 2014 that “certain ‘closely held’ for-profit businesses can cite religious objections in order to opt out of a requirement in ObamaCare to provide free contraceptive coverage for their employees.” This according to a June 30, 2014 article by Fox News, which said that the Supreme Court justices ruled 5-4 in favor of Hobby Lobby and one other company, after legal teams argued that a 1993 federal law on religious freedom, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , applied also to business.

"," It’s become fairly common for burglars to break into cars using a hole-punch to make a hole under the door lock. One of the first reports surfaced in 1999 when former Santa Fe Mayor Larry Delgado’s car was broken into using a hole-punch. The Albuquerque Journal reports that a purse belonging to Delgado’s wife was stolen from the car. Another high-profile case involved R&B star Usher in January 2010. Access Atlanta reports that the singer lost more than $1 million in jewelry, clothes and electronics after burglars punched a hole near his SUV’s door handle. The Adams County Sheriff’s Office even issued a warning to residents that hole-punch car break-ins were on the rise near Natchez, Mississippi, in January 2013. “The latest M.O. is to punch out the door locks just below the key pad with tools — a hole-punch used by metal workers and a hammer — usually on the passenger side of the car so that you don’t notice it immediately,” Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said. “Also, to delay discovery, they are not taking the whole purse or wallet — just cash or credit cards, maybe a gun that you keep under the seat or valuables in the glove box. So again, you don’t notice right away and they have plenty of time to flee the scene.” Sheriff Mayfield’s account mirrors the accusations outlined in the eRumor: the passenger side door was broken into and select items were stolen to conceal the crime.

Rather, the interceptors are actually radio-equipped computers that are outfitted with software that enables them to access antiquated cellular networks and to bypass onboard encryption systems. Most cell phones can’t distinguish interceptor towers from ordinary towers — which leaves them susceptible to “over-the-air” attacks like eavesdropping and spyware, according to Popular Science.

"," The term “Black Friday” can be traced back to the 1860s, but it was never used to describe a day after Thanksgiving “sale” on enslaved African-Americans. The claim that retailers borrowed “Black Friday” from slave traders lit up social media in both 2013 and 2014. According to the eRumor: “Did you know Black Friday stemmed from slavery? It was the day after Thanksgiving when slave traders would sell slaves for a discount to assist plantation owners with more helpers for the upcoming winter (for cutting and stacking fire wood, winterproofing, etc.)” A number of celebrities fueled the controversy in November of 2014 when they re-posted the message and urged their followers to boycott shopping on Black Friday. In truth, the day after Thanksgiving was first referred to as Black Friday in the early 1950s. It described the rash of employees who called in sick after Thanksgiving to extend their holiday weekend, according to a 1951 column that appeared in the Factory and Maintenance trade publication. According to the column: “’Friday-after-Thanksgiving-itis’ is a disease second only to the bubonic plague in its effects. At least that’s the feeling of those who have to get production out, when the ‘Black Friday’ comes along. The shop may be half empty, but every absentee was sick — and can prove it.” Black Friday was first applied to retail sales in the 1960s — but it was used to deter shoppers, not to encourage them. Philadelphia traffic cops coined the term to warn shoppers about traffic jams and theft brought on by sales and the annual Army-Navy football game held on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Philly.com reports . According to the article: “Today the term seems lost in antiquity, but it was a traffic cop who started it, the guy who directed traffic with a semaphore while standing on a small wooden platform, in the days before traffic lights.” Author and retail scholar Michael Lisicky said the term initially succeeded in scaring shoppers away. However, retailer Peter Strawbridge re-branded it and claimed that Black Friday referred to business profits “going into the black” by the late 1960s. And although the earliest use of Black Friday can be traced back to the 1860s, it didn’t refer to the slave trade.

"Girl Scout Cookies Fund Planned Parenthood-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/afa-gsusa-cookies/"," Pro-life activists say Girl Scout cookie sales benefit Planned Parenthood and have called for a boycott. "," Girl Scout cookies don’t fund Planned Parenthood. Also, contrary to many allegations, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), the national organization, doesn’t have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the “Today” show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange , Clogninger defended the council’s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that’s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls. …It’s really impossible for girls to grow up in today’s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn’t acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there’s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter “does not take a position to develop materials” or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video : We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it’s an investment in a little girl… Given Clonginger’s earlier remarks, Chavez’s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local “relationships” between councils and Planned Parenthood while Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There’s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn’t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get licensing royalties from bakers of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl’s Girl Scout experience.

"ALS Association Supports Embryonic Stem Cell Research-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/als-association-warning/"," Religious groups have raised concerns that the ALS Association, which has seen an overwhelming influx of donations through its ice bucket challenge, supports embryonic stem cell research to help find a cure for the degenerative neurological condition. "," The ALS Association funds one study that uses   embryonic stem cell research, according to an August 23, 2014, article by the   Minneapolis Star Tribune. The ALS Association said that the research was funded by “one specific   donor who is committed to this area of research.” Additionally, the ALS Association said donors were able to stipulate   that they do not want their donations used to fund any stem cell   research, if they so choose. Human embryonic stem cell lines that are used in research come from   embryos that were left over from in vitro fertilization, or from embryos   that carry genetic mutations like cystic fibrosis or Tay Sachs disease,   according to the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine’s   website. After a couple completes the in vitro fertilization process, they either   continue paying for the leftover embryos to remain frozen or allow them   to thaw, which destroys the cells. Couples in some states, however, also have the choice to donate the   embryos to research or adoptive families, according to the institute. “The discovery that human embryonic stem cells can   be isolated and propagated in culture with the potential of developing   into all tissues of the body is a major medical breakthrough. However it   has raised a great deal of ethical questions,” the ALS Association said   on its website . Posted 08/25/14 ","Miscellaneous"

AT&T agreed to a $105 million payout to settle a “ mobile cramming ” case that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought against the company. According to the FTC : “Cramming happens when a company uses your mobile or landline phone bill like a credit card, and adds a charge for services like trivia, ringtones, daily horoscopes or love tips to your bill that you didn’t agree to or use. The most common dollar amount for a cramming charge is $9.99, a relatively small amount, which is easy to overlook. Some charges sound like larger fees you do owe, making it tough to pick out the phony charges, especially if your mobile phone bill varies month to month.” AT&T users may have unknowingly paid for third-party charges on their phone bills that were bundled into their monthly service charges.

"Yellowstone “super volcano”-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/yellowstone/"," Changes in Yellowstone National Park may be signs of the overdue eruption of a “super volcano” underneath the park. "," This is one of those stories that is based on some actual events happening at Yellowstone National Park. The exact truth of it, however, is difficult to determine, primarily because it’s impossible to predict when volcanic and geologic events are going to take place. The experts we’ve talked with at the National Park Service and the U.S. Geologic Survey, however, feel that the eRumor is exaggerated and may cause undue alarm. Yellowstone National Park is a unique visitor’s destination with fascinating geothermal wonders such as the famous “Old Faithful” geyser. Occupying portions of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, it was the first of the United States’ National Parks. According to a park spokesperson, that it is believed that a part of what resulted in Yellowstone National park was a massive volcanic eruption about 600,000 years ago and the area is actively volcanic. The park sits atop a huge underground volcano and conditions in the park are constantly monitored by scientists. But most of what is being observed now is believed by scientists to be the result of geothermal activity, not volcanic. Regarding the areas that were closed to visitors at the Norris Geyser basin, the park says there are “annual disturbances” that this year were longer than normal and resulted in the formation of many new steam vents and higher ground temperatures. Some vegetation near the hottest areas died because of the heat. The areas closed to visitors as a precaution re-opened in October 2003. The USGS issued a statement in 2003 saying that the events in the Norris basin were not thought to be volcanic but they were notable and are being watched with concern. Some of the eRumors about Yellowstone refer to an underground bulge in Yellowstone Lake, which like much of Yellowstone Park is in an area very active with various hydrothermal events. This was described in a 2003 report from USGS researcher Lisa Morgan as “the inflated plain.” She noted an area about 2000 feet long that rises about 100 feet above the lake floor. The USGS says they regard it as the result of a buildup of gas, which has happened elsewhere in the lake. There is fear that it could be the signal of a major “hydrothermal explosion” when the water that feeds Yellowstone’s geysers and hot springs is flashed to steam .Further research will be done to see if anything else could be causing the bulge. They do not regard it as being of any danger to visitors to Yellowstone Park and that the bulge may have been there for decades or longer. The USGS also says that all the activity in Yellowstone at the moment seems to be from hydrothermal activity rather than volcanic eruptions and that craters appear to be from either collapse or old hydrothermal explosions. But as with any volcanically active area, that can change. Last updated 11/25/03 ","Miscellaneous"

In an article published in February of 2003, the ASA says that a 60-second test can help determine whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  The three question test has been used by health care professionals as an initial way of determining whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  But a research project by North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, N.C. looked into the question of whether non-medical professionals could administer the short test and correctly identify the symptoms of a possible stroke.  The conclusions was yes, that bystanders could be helpful in determining whether a person is experiencing a stroke.  One of the reasons they looked into it was to see whether bystanders could be helpful to a 9-1-1 dispatcher in helping narrow down what is happening to a potential patient. The three questions given to the suspected stroke sufferers were: Can you raise your arms and keep them up? Can you smile? Can you repeat a simple sentence? The study found that when non-medical volunteers were asked by a telephone dispatcher to administer the test, they correctly identified the symptoms 96 percent of the time…especially the raising of the arms and the speaking of a simple sentence.  They were less effective in evaluating whether there was facial weakness in a smile, probably because of not knowing what the person’s normal smile looked like.  Doctors caution that this does not mean that citizens should try to diagnose stroke symptoms themselves. This study focused on citizens who were being given instruction over the telephone by emergency dispatchers. Any sign of weakness in the face, slurred speech, or weakness or numbness in the limbs should be evaluated by medical professionals immediately. If stroke victims are given proper help within 3 hours of the stroke, the ability to recover is greatly increased.

"," There is no evidence that we could find that this is true. In an article on www.railway.org by D. Gabe Gabriel says this tale has existed since shortly after World War II but that history does not support the claims of the story.  The Roman ruts, according to Gabriel, were not for chariots but for narrow, hand-pulled carts.  Although there are many places where the ruts are visible, Gabriel questions that they played a role in English railroad standards 1400 years after the last Roman legions.  One of the claims of the eRumor is that the width of the ruts was affected by the need to make the chariot and it’s wheels the same width as the combined rears of the horses pulling them.  Gabriel says there’s a statue by Franzoni in the Vatican museum that is regarded as the most accurate known depiction of a Roman chariot.  The two horses are wider than the chariot and the chariot wheels behind them. Where did the four-foot, eight-and-a-half-inch standard originate?  Gabriel says it was from a Englishman named George Stephenson.  Carts on rails had been used in mines in England for years, but the width of the rails varied from mine to mine since they didn’t share tracks.  Stephenson was the one who started experimenting with putting a steam engine on the carts so there would be propulsion to pull them along.  He had worked with several mines with differing gauges and simply chose to make the rails for his project 4-foot, eight inches wide.  He later decided that adding another six inches made things easier.  He was later consulted for constructing some rails along a roadway and by the time broader plans for railroads in Great Britain were proposed, there were already 1200 miles of his rails so the “Stephenson gauge” became the standard. Interestingly, the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch width has not always been the standard in the U.S.  According to the Encyclopedia of American Business History and Biography, at the beginning of the Civil War, there were more than 20 different gauges ranging from 3 to 6 feet, although the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch was the most widely used.  During the war, any supplies transported by rail had to be transferred by hand whenever a car on one gauge encountered track of another gauge and more than 4,000 miles of new track was laid during the war to standardize the process.  Later, Congress decreed that the 4-foot, eight-and-a-half inch standard would be used for transcontinental railway. updated 5/30/02 ","Miscellaneous"
"“Prophet Yahweh” the Las Vegas Man Who Says He Can Call UFOsInto Sight on Command-Under Investigation!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/prophetyahweh/"," A Las Vegas man calling himself “Prophet Yahweh” claims to be able to summon UFO’s on command and says he’ll be doing so from June 1 through July 15, 2005, culminating in the appearance of a large spaceship that will hover over Las Vegas for two days. "," Prophet Yahwah is making quite a stir       in Las Vegas. He was an obscure guy with a religious fervor who hosted a cable TV       show on UFOs. He claimed to be able to make them appear whenever he wished and did       so from time to time for small groups in back yards or parks. He posted numerous home-made videos of the alleged sightings but       skeptics didn’t give them much notice. Then he issued a news release saying that beginning on June 1, 2005,       he was going to be calling for UFO sighting on a daily basis until       July 15. Las Vegas TV station KTNV decided to put Prophet Yahweh to the test       and had one of its reporters and film crews meet with him at a date,       time, and place chosen by the station. Prophet Yahweh prayed for a sighting and a light in the sky,       described as orange, did appear and was filmed. Click       Here for a clip of the report. Prophet Yahweh predicted that at some time during the 45-days a spaceship       would descend and hover over Las Vegas not far from Nellis Air Force       base and that it would be visible both day and night for two days. It did not appear, however, and Prophet Yahweh said it was because       the Las Vegas media blocked him out and would not cover the event,       so he did not call down the spaceship. Shortly afterwards, he said he was going to travel to all 50 states       to demonstrate his ability to call down UFO’s. UFO supporters are excited about his claims and believe him. Skeptics don’t know how he does it but say they’ll figure it out. Prophet Yahweh describes his profession as       “Entertainment/Media” on a Yahoo personals profile and       skeptics wonder if there is any connection between his antics and       the upcoming Spielberg film “The War of the Worlds.” Prophet Yahweh has formerly been known as Ramon Watkins, born in       Memphis, Tennessee, according to his biography. He attended Tuskegee Institute then Southern Illinois University       where he says he first “joined the ministry” and had both       radio and cable television shows in Atlanta. He started a UFO cable TV show in Los Angeles in 1996. In 1999, he says he had a dream that told him to move to Las Vegas       where he also hosts a cable TV show on UFOs. He claims to have discovered the ancient art of summoning UFOs and       spaceships on command (he makes a distinction between the two). On his Yahoo Personals page, he lists himself as divorced and       seeking an “African Queen” (he is African-American). He also lists his religion as Jewish. Under the name of Prophet Yahweh he is the owner of several Internet       domain names including a site that is condemning of the Roman       Catholic church and another site that promotes polygamy.

"," The picture is real as is the story of the photographer’s suicide, but the alleged wording of his suicide note is fabricated. Kevin Carter was a South African photojournalist. The picture of the vulture stalking a starving girl is real and was taken in Sudan in 1993. He was awarded Pulitzer prize in May of 1994 for the picture. Two months later he connected a hose to the exhaust pipe of his pickup truck and committed suicide. His long time friend Judith Matloff wrote in the Columbia Journalism review that Carter was the kind of person who seemed more affected by some of the violent events he photographed. She says that he would often return from upsetting assignments with bouts of crying, drinking, or using drugs. She says that after he shot his Pulitzer prize winning picture, he “sat under a tree and cried and chain-smoked” and couldn’t distance himself from the horror of what he saw. He was criticized for not helping the girl in the picture and said he did not know what happened to her. In his suicide note he said he was “depressed…without phone…money for tent…money for child support…money for debts…money!!!!!” He also said he was haunted by vivid memories of killings, corpses, anger, pain, starving or wounded children, and trigger-happy madmen.” The eRumor includes a comment about world hunger that was created by someone along the way who decided to turn the picture into a lesson about not wasting food.

"," If you ever find yourself in the       midst of a natural disaster or other crisis that affects a large       number of people, brace yourself for rumors. Whether they start because of sincere misinformation or because of       intentional misinformation, they can spread like wildfire,       especially during a time when other types of communication are not       working.

"Put an “ICE” entry in your cell phone for emergencies-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ice/"," The eRumor says that after the terrorist bombings in London in July, 2005, an ambulance service started a campaign to encourage you to put an “ICE” entry into your cell phone that contains the names and numbers of people to be contacted in case you are in an emergency. "," The campaign is true, although it was not prompted by the London terrorist bombings. It was started in April, 2005 by a paramedic based in Cambridge in England. His name is Bob Brotchie and he is a clinical team leader for the East Anglian Ambulance NHS Trust. He said he got tired of trying to figure out who to contact when dealing with shocked or injured patients who can’t give the information themselves. The campaign encourages people to put an entry in their cell phones and other portable address devices under the name of “ICE” (In case of emergency).  Emergency personnel can quickly check the cell phone for the ICE entry and reach  whoever’s name and contact information is there. It also gives the cell phone owner the opportunity to choose who will be contacted during an emergency when that person may not want Mom, Dad, or some other same-named relative to be called. The announcement of the campaign in April was made by Brotchie, a British war hero named Simon Weston, and the Vodafone Life Saver Awards. Vodafone is a cell provider in the UK and says that its research has shown that more than 75 percent of the people it surveyed don’t carry any information about who they would want contacted on their behalf in case of an emergency.

Wendy’s conducted an investigation as did health authorities and could not find any evidence that the finger had originated from anywhere within Wendy’s.

One describes a pregnancy that many would argue would justify an abortion but the child turns out to be Beethoven. The describes three world leaders and asks which you would vote for. Their qualifications seem clear, but their identities are surprising. "," The eRumor has some factual problems. As far as we can tell from researching the life of Beethoven, it’s misleading to set up the question by saying he would have been his mother’s ninth birth. Only three of the children born to Maria Magdalena Beethoven survived infancy, with the composer Ludvig Von  Beethoven being the oldest of the three. Beethoven himself suffered from deafness in adulthood, but we found no evidence of deaf, blind, or mentally retarded siblings as children. We found no substantiation of Beethoven’s mother having had syphilis. She is said to have died of what at that time was called consumption or tuberculosis. Regarding candidate A, Franklin Roosevelt, there is talk among astrologers that he consulted with astrologer Evangeline Adams, but we have not been able to document that. We don’t know how many mistresses Franklin Roosevelt had but he had an affair with his wife’s social secretary Lucy Page Mercer.  She was with him when he died in 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia. He did like his martinis and is credited with having been the first to mix a martini in the White House and was a smoker. Regarding candidate B, Winston Churchill, according to WinstonChurchill.org, he was known for his drinking. We could not find whether he used opium in college. Regarding candidate C, Adolph Hitler, it is true that there is no evidence that he ever cheated on his wife but that’s primarily because he was married to her for a few hours before both of them committed suicide.

This picture of an elaborate maze on the farm of John Rose of Rose Farms in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. There are dozens of such corn mazes in the United States where enthusiasts pay a few dollars to the farmers for the fun of trying to solve the mazes. There are several websites dedicated to either finding the mazes or helping farmers design and make them such as www.cornfieldmaze.com . John Rose’s first project was a horse and buggy design, which he figured would cover about 8 acres and would take a 7-man crew about a week to make.  Rose contacted Navtech GPS supply to ask if there was a way to use GPS to streamline the process. A GPS device uses signals from various satellites space to plot an exact location on the earth.  The folks at Navtech sent a GPS to Rose and asked him to drive around the 8 acres with it so a precise map could be drawn of the dimensions of the field as well as its location. They then used computer software to lay out the picture of the horse and buggy, converted that to data that could be entered into the GPS, and Rose used a special riding mower along with the GPS and a laptop computer to hack out the maze in the maize.  It took about 3 hours.

"," The television report is true.  Whether John Kanzius’ discovery is revolutionary or not remains to be seen. Kanzius is a former television station owner and broadcast engineer from Pennsylvania who now lives in Florida. According to the report, Kanzius came up with an idea for using radio waves to kill cancer cells.  It involved injecting tiny bits of certain metals into cancer patients—metals that would be attracted by the cancer cells.  Since radio waves can make certain metals hotter, the thought was that the radiated pieces of metal might make the cancer cells die. Kanzius has a personal interest in the quest.  He has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. Along the way Kanzius made an accidental discovery of a different nature.  He found that when salt water was placed into the radio waves, it would burst into flame—an incredibly hot flame.  He said it was because the hydrogen and the oxygen were being released from the salt water. A company in Akron has checked out Kanzius’ discovery and says it’s quite remarkable.  A small steam engine has been constructed to demonstrate the potential. There is work to be done, though, before the radio wave-salt water device will be powering cars or generating plants.  A lot of energy goes into creating the radio waves in the first place so there needs to be some assessment as to whether the energy that comes from it is worth it. Meanwhile, his original goal of fighting cancer is being looked into.  In January, 2007, researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston say they reached a milestone by killing pancreatic cancer cells in the laboratory using Kanzius’ method.  Next will be animal experimentation then human.

Because there are other artificial colors, the presence of “artificial colors” on a food label does not necessarily mean that caramel coloring is contained in the food. Also, the presence of “caramel coloring” on a food label does not necessarily mean that the food contains 4-MEI, because the term “caramel coloring” also may be used to describe Class I and Class II caramel coloring. Class I and Class II caramel coloring do not contain 4-MEI. And, even if Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte does include 4-MEI, FDA says there’s no proof that it’s harmful to humans: Based on the available information, FDA has no reason to believe that there is any immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food from the use of caramel coloring.

Koman CEO Nancy Goodman Brinker once received a 64 percent raise. But a Susan G. Komen Foundation representative told TruthorFiction.com that Brinker later accepted a pay cut and is no longer the foundation’s chief executive. Nancy Goodman Brinker, the founder and former CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, came under fire when reports surfaced in 2013 that she had received a 64 percent raise after the foundation announced that it had canceled half of its three-day fundraising races. The raise, which a company official told NBC News was issued in 2010, brought Brinker’s salary to $684,000. After accepting a 42 percent pay cut, Brinker made $549,000 in 2012, the Dallas Business Journal reports . By the end of 2013, Brinker had stepped down from her role as CEO of the Susan G. Komen Foundation. The foundation announced that Brinker would be paid $390,000 per year in her new role as “founder and chair of global strategy” in 2014. Dr. Judith A. Salerno was tapped to replace Brinker as the president and CEO of the foundation, and her salary was set at $475,000 for 2014. Reports that the Susan G. Komen Foundation donates just 20 percent of its revenues to breast cancer research are also true — and misleading. Charity Navigator, an independent organization that rates non-profit groups, reported that the Susan G. Komen Foundation took in roughly $263.6 million in fiscal year 2012. The foundation reported that it had devoted more than $58 million to research grants in fiscal year 2012. That means a little more than 22 percent of the foundation’s total revenues were allocated to research — but it’s important to note that research is just one component of Susan G. Komen Foundation’s mission. The foundation also supports patients with breast cancer, promotes awareness, funds community breast cancer screenings and programs, and advocates on behalf of breast cancer patients and healthcare providers around the world. Charity Navigator classifies the Susan G. Komen Foundation as a “highly rated” non-profit group with an overall performance score of 81.96 out of 100. Posted 10/20/14 ","Miscellaneous"
"Laminin, a protein important to the body, is in the shape of a cross-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:44","https://www.truthorfiction.com/laminin/"," The eRumor talks of a substance called “laminin” that is described as part of a family of proteins that “hold us together.”  Then there is a picture of laminin—which looks like a cross. "," This story leads into complex considerations of science and biology but the main questions it prompts are whether laminin is as important as the eRumor claims and does it have a shape like a cross. The simple answer to both questions seems to be yes. Laminin is defined by the Webster Medical Dictionary as a “glycoprotein that is a component of connective tissue basement membrane and that promotes cell adhesion.”  In other words, looking at laminin as a kind of glue isn’t far from the truth.  There are several different laminins. In their book The Laminins authors Peter Elkblom and Rupert Timpl go into more detail about both the importance of laminins and their structure.  They describe laminins that, together with other proteins, “hold cells and tissues together.”   They also say, “Electron microscopy reveals a cross-like shape for all laminins investigated so far.”  They went on to say that in solution the laminin shapes were more like a flower than a cross.  The strands of laminins do not always stand straight and at right angles, but they do consists of arms, three of which are short and one of which is long. Research has been conducted on laminins in connection with numerous conditions and diseases.  It has been found, for example, that people with congenital muscular dystrophies do not have  laminin-alpha2, which is normally found in the layer of cells around muscle fibers and other cells important to the structural integrity of muscle cells.

"Illegal Immigrants Cost U.S. Taxpayers $338.3 Billion a Year-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-immigrants-costs/"," Illegal aliens cost federal, state and local governments $338.3 billion a year. "," Studies on how much illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers each year vary greatly, but the eRumor’s claim that the total cost is $338.3 billion a year is false. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) studied 29 different reports on the impact of unauthorized immigrants on state and local government budgets in 2007. “It is important to note, though, that currently available estimates have significant limitations; therefore, using them to determine an aggregate effect across all states would be difficult and prone to considerable error,” the CBO said. No comprehensive data has been compiled on how much state and local governments spend on services for illegal immigrants, but individual studies from both ends of the political spectrum are at odds with the eRumor’s claim that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers $338.3 billion a year. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research think tank, estimated in 2013 that the aggregate annual deficit for all unlawful citizens was about $54.4 billion. The “aggregate amount” is the total cost of benefits and services received by all unlawful immigrant households, with the taxes they paid subtracted. The CBO study concluded that about half of illegal aliens pay taxes, and that they receive more benefits from state and local governments than they pay for. “The estimates that CBO reviewed measured costs associated with providing services to unauthorized immigrants that ranged from a few million dollars in states with small unauthorized populations to tens of billions of dollars in California,” the CBO said. Education, health care and law enforcement were the highest areas of state and local spending on illegal immigrants. The CBO found, however, that unauthorized immigrants accounted for no more than 5 percent of total state spending on those services. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 established citizenship requirements in order to receive most federal benefits. When the bill was signed into law, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cut federal spending by $54.1 billion over six years. Restrictions on benefits for non-citizens were expected to account for 44 percent, or about $23.7 billion, of the total cost savings. However, much of the expected cost savings were “undone” by actions taken by state governments to provide benefits to immigrants who were affected by federal welfare reform. Some aspects of the law also weren’t fully implemented, according to a report by the Centers for Immigration Studies. Although studies and estimates vary greatly, available data does not support the eRumor’s claim that U.S. taxpayers spend $338.3 billion on illegal immigrants each year.

"Former Marine Arrested in Crack Down on Anti-Government Commenters -Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/former-marine-arrested/"," Forwarded emails claim that a former Marine was detained for making anti-government comments on social media, and that the case proves there is a larger government effort to crackdown on government critics. "," It’s true that a former Marine was held for psychiatric evaluation after authorities were tipped-off about cryptic anti-government Facebook posts he made. The case doesn’t, however, prove that a larger crackdown on people who post anti-government comments on social media sites is underway. Police from Chesterfield, Virginia, detained former Marine Brandon Raub for a mental health evaluation on August 16, 2012. Police and FBI agents had been dispatched to Raub’s home to investigate a complaint that his Facebook posts had grown increasingly dark. Chesterfield Police said county mental health crisis intervention workers determined that Raub should be held under a temporary detention order and taken to a hospital for further evaluation based on his interactions with police. Raub was held in psychiatric care until a county judge ordered his release on August 23, 2012. In his ruling, the judge said Raub had suffered “a deprivation of liberty,” an NBC News affiliate reports . No criminal charges were filed in the case. In May 2013, attorneys for the Rutherford Institute, an organization that says it defends civil liberties, filed a civil lawsuit on Raub’s behalf. The lawsuit sought damages for alleged violations of Raub’s First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In March 2014, a federal judge dismissed the case and said mental health workers had acted reasonably in recommending Raub’s detention, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports . Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute appealed the decision in August 2014. The appeal says a former Marine who served with Raub in Iraq had tipped-off authorities about Raub’s Facebook posts. Some of the posts called for the arrests of President George W. Bush and President H.W. Bush and claimed that the U.S. government had orchestrated 9/11. Raub also talked about how revolution could lead to the former presidents’ demise. Another passage that drew attention stated, “Sharpen up my axe; I’m here to severe heads.” Raub later argued that the passage was intended to be “metaphorical” and said it was a song lyric. Authorities determined that Raub’s messages didn’t include specific threats of violence and didn’t rise to a criminal level. The eRumor’s claims about a larger ant-government crackdown may be based on “Operation Vigilant Eagle.” The FBI launched the program in April 2009 to target white supremacists and “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reports . FBI memos stated that the Vigilant Eagle program was designed to “share information regarding Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans whose involvement in white supremacy and/or militia sovereign citizen extremist groups poses a domestic terrorism threat.” However, the FBI didn’t detain Raub as part of Vigilant Eagle. Local authorities ordered Raub held for psychiatric evaluation based on his interactions with police, not based on his Facebook posts. Posted 10/31/14 ","Miscellaneous"

"Bill Gates Admits to Chemtrails-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-gates-chemtrails/"," Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates has funded millions of dollars in research on geoengineering, or “chemtrails,” which is the practice of depositing reflective sulfur oxide particles into the atmosphere to counteract global warming. "," Blog posts that allege Bill Gates has admitted to the existence of chemtrails and has funded research for geoengineering are true. Gates first said geoengineering research, which includes chemtrails, could delay the impact of global warming by 20 or 30 years at a 2010 TED Talks event on geoengineering in Lithuania. “That’s just an insurance policy, and you’d hope you wouldn’t need to do that,” Gates said. “Some say we shouldn’t even work on the insurance policy… I’m not sure that’s wise, given the importance of the problem. “ A video of the TED Talks event can be viewed here . Gates went one step further in 2012. He established a multi-million fund for a small team of Harvard researchers to study geoengineering, the Guardian reported . “The objective is not to alter the climate, but simply to probe the processes at a micro scale,” David Keith, one of the researchers, told the Guardian. “The direct risk is very small.” There’s nothing illegal about the research, either. Small-scale research on chemtrails is allowed under a moratorium placed on geoengineering by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010. “…No climate-related geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity (may) take place, until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities and appropriate consideration of the associated risks for the environment and biodiversity and associated social, economic and cultural impacts, with the exception of small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting,” the group said.

"GPS Explodes After Overheating–Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gps-explodes/"," An email shows photos of a sports utility vehicle that allegedly suffered significant fire damage after a Garmin GPS unit attached to the dashboard overheated and exploded. "," The photos included in this eRumor do not show damage from a GPS that overheated and exploded. Photos of the fire-damaged SUV were first used in a previous eRumor that claimed an iPhone charger overheated and exploded in 2009. The photos were used again in a post featured in the commentary section of the Edwards Air Force Base homepage in June 2012. The post claimed the explosion was “recently” caused by an overheated GPS unit that was left attached to the windshield of a car at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. Current emailed variations of the eRumor appear to be based on that report. Upon close inspection, however, the photos themselves disprove the eRumor. The vehicle pictured has a dashboard-mounted GPS system, which would seemingly render a standalone unit unnecessary. But like many eRumors, this one is based on a kernel of truth.

"A tax refund on 2006 forms for excise tax on long-distance phonecalls-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/exisetax/"," The IRS is offering a tax credit on 2006 tax forms for money paid in excise taxes on telephone calls. "," The eRumor is long, detailed, and complicated but it is true that on your tax forms for the 2006 tax year in the U.S. you can claim a tax credit because of a change in the collection of Federal excise taxes on telephone calls.  This is because of federal court decisions ruling that the tax no longer applies to long distance calls the way they are billed today. It applies to land-line, cellular, and even Internet calls. Here are some of the details: -Excise taxes on long-distance telephone service was halted beginning August 1, 2006. -Refunds are being offered to individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations for excise taxes paid on long-distance service between February 28, 2003 and August 1, 2006. -If you want to go to the trouble of actually assembling all the telephone bills for that period, you can do it and get a refund on the actual taxes you paid, but for convenience there is a simpler way to do it. If you claim one exemption, the refund is $30 If you claim two exemptions, the refund is $40 If you claim three exemptions, the refund is $50 If you claim four exemptions or more, the refund is $60. -You do not need to itemize deductions.  The tax credit will be offered on all individual tax forms for 2006 taxes. -For businesses and non-profits, the IRS has come up with a formula for a refund.  Check with your tax preparer for details. Historically, the long-distance excise tax was based on the time and distance of a call.  But in the 1990s more telephone companies started charging for long-distance calls without regard to distance and court challenges argued that the tax should not longer be levied.

"," It is true that Doe Run is shutting down the smelter that has been in operation since 1892. This is the last primary lead smelter in the U.S. and the Doe Run Company, citing a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency,  issued the following release on their website : The Doe Run Company (Doe Run) has issued the following response related to the company’s Herculaneum, Mo., smelter: On Dec. 31, 2013, The Doe Run Company’s primary lead smelter in Herculaneum, Mo., which has operated since 1892, will cease operations. As a result of the smelter’s closure, 145 Doe Run employees, and approximately 73 contractors, will lose their jobs. Seventy-five positions will be retained for closure and limited operations. Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States. (Primary smelters produce lead from mined resources.) In 2010, Doe Run reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Missouri. As part of that settlement, the Company agreed to discontinue its smelting operations in Herculaneum by the end of 2013. Over the operating life of the smelter, the Company spent millions of dollars in environmental and other upgrades. Continuing to upgrade the aging smelter to attempt to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations imposed on primary lead smelters was not economically feasible given the many other requirements of our business.* We shared this news in 2010 in a press release available on our website. The Company had hoped to bring a revolutionary lead metal production technology online prior to the closure of the smelter. This proprietary, new technology (also announced in 2010) uses a wet-chemical, electrowinning process instead of a heat-based smelting process, greatly reducing sulfur dioxide and lead emissions. In 2012, we announced that the cost to build a comparably-sized electrowinning plant was too great for our company, given the present economic conditions and other demands on our operations. We continue to pursue opportunities to bring this technology to commercialization, perhaps on a smaller scale. This past year, we have worked with our Herculaneum employees to help them transition into new opportunities. Some have taken jobs within other divisions of our company; others have found new careers. Those who remain have been provided skill assessment and training, resume and interviewing skill building, financial counseling and a variety of services. We have a dedicated, hardworking and skilled workforce and we are making every effort to help them transition successfully. As noted above, we expect to keep approximately 75 employees at our Herculaneum facility in 2014 to assist with the continuing operations, including refining and alloying of lead metal, and closure of our site. More than 80 percent of all lead produced in the U.S. is used in either motive batteries to start vehicles, or in stationary batteries for backup power (particular in military, telecom and medical applications). In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making  lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product. These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri. Lead is used in numerous other products, including ammunition and construction materials, as well as to protect against radiation in medical and military applications. While most applications can use secondary lead, those applications that require primary lead will need to import the lead metal in the future. Any additional demand for lead (above that which can be met through recycling at secondary smelters) will also have to be met through imports. *In 2008, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead was reduced from 1.5 µg/m3 (micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air) to 0.15 µg/m3.

A video of an iPhone 6 Plus “bend test” is available here . However, Consumer Reports conducted a scientific test that calls into question the extent of the bendy iPhone 6 eRumor. The test found that the iPhone 6 Plus began to deform when 90 pounds of force was applied and came apart under 110 pounds of force.

"What did Megachurch pastor Rick Warren Really Say about Gays and Gay Marriage?","2015-03-17 18:06:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rick-warren-prop8/"," A forwarded email about a CNN interview with Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback Church in Southern California.  It says that Warren disavowed support of Proposition 8. "," In April, 2009, Rick Warren of Saddleback Church in California started granting media interviews for the first time since the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Of particular interest to interviewers was Warren’s reaction to the controversy that resulted from his acceptance of the invitation from Mr. Obama to say a prayer at the president-to-be’s inauguration. Obama had been a friend to the gay community and there was an outcry that he asked an evangelical pastor who had endorsed Proposition 8 on the November ballot in California, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Several articles and emails circulated on the Internet criticizing Warren after an April 6, 2009 interview on CNN with Larry King. One of the criticisms in an article from Baptist Press was that during the King interview Warren denied ever giving an endorsement to Proposition 8. Other critics said he seemed to be backing away from opposition to gay marriage. In the interview, Warren did not deny ever endorsing the measure. He told King that during the two-year campaign for Proposition 8 he did not take a stand on it, but a week before the election he sent a message to his congregation in support of Proposition 8. Here is the exact quote: “During the whole Proposition 8 thing, I never once went to a meeting, never once issued a statement, never — never once even gave an endorsement in the two years Prop 8 was going. The week before the — the vote, somebody in my church said, Pastor Rick, what — what do you think about this? And I sent a note to my own members that said, I actually believe that marriage is — really should be defined, that that definition should be — say between a man and a woman.” That statement was softer than the wording of his message to the members of Saddleback Church that Warren sent in October, 2008, just before the election. In it he said, “Now let me say this really clearly: we support Proposition 8 — and if you believe what the Bible says about marriage, you need to support Proposition 8.” A statement was issued on April 9, 2009 by Saddleback Church clarifying the statements on Larry King. It said, “Throughout his pastoral ministry spanning nearly 30 years, Dr. Warren has remained committed to the biblical definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, for life — a position held by most fellow Evangelical pastors. He has further stressed that for 5,000 years, EVERY culture and EVERY religion has maintained this worldview. When Dr. Warren told Larry King that he never campaigned for California’s Proposition 8, he was referring to not participating in the official two-year organized advocacy effort specific to the ballot initiative in that state, based on his focus and leadership on other compassion issues. Because he’s a pastor, not an activist, in response to inquiries from church members, he issued an email and video message to his congregation days before the election confirming where he and Saddleback Church stood on this issue.” On the King show, Warren also said he had issued an apology to the gay community which critics took to mean that he was sorry he supported proposition 8. The church statement of April 9 addressed that issues as well. It said, “During the King interview, Dr. Warren also referenced a letter of apology that he sent to gay leaders whom he knew personally. However, that mea culpa was not with respect to his statements or position on Proposition 8 nor the biblical worldview on marriage. Rather, he apologized for his comments in an earlier Beliefnet interview expressing his concern about expanding or redefining the definition of marriage beyond a husband-wife relationship, during which he unintentionally and regrettably gave the impression that consensual adult same sex relationships were equivalent to incest or pedophilia.” updated 04/13/09 ","Miscellaneous"

"," Starbucks is a member of a trade association that challenged Vermont’s genetically modified food labeling law, but the claim that Starbucks and Monsanto “teamed up” isn’t true. The eRumor began with a petition launched by the consumer advocacy group SumofUs . The petition called for customers to urge Starbucks to withdraw its support for the lawsuit challenging Vermont’s genetically modified organism (GMO) food labeling law. “Starbucks doesn’t think you have the right to know what’s in your coffee. So it’s teamed up with Monsanto to sue the small U.S. State of Vermont to stop you from finding out,” the petition states. Vermont’s GMO food labeling law, Act 120 , would require food manufacturers to label all GMO foods sold in the state. It’s scheduled to go into effect in July 2016. A number of trade associations challenged the labeling law in federal court. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the Snack Foods Association, the International Dairy Foods Association and the National Association of Manufacturers filed the lawsuit. The eRumor’s claim that Starbucks and Monsanto “teamed up” on the lawsuit appears to stem from Starbucks’ membership in the GMA. The GMA and Monsanto have been two of the biggest opponents of GMO labeling laws around the country and have poured millions of dollars into the effort. However, Starbucks is just one of more than 300 companies that belong to the GMA, so claims that Starbucks teamed up with Monsanto to sue Vermont are inaccurate. In fact, Starbucks says it hasn’t provided financial support for the GMA’s efforts to fight GMO labeling requirements. “We have not taken a position on the issue of GMO labeling. We continue to explore how we can best provide our customers the information they need to make informed decisions about their food and beverage choices,” a Starbucks spokesperson told NPR .

He told an ABC affiliate that he considers wasp   spray “inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or pepper   spray.”  Glinka said, “This is better than anything I can teach   them.” Pepper spray is a personal defense weapon that is legal in all 50   states.

There is also a   liability issue to consider.

"," The Volkswagen (VW) L1 is a real car, seats 2 and if released would have a price tag $25,900. Volkswagen has designed and built the L-1 with an eye toward better gas mileage and lower carbon emissions. It has not yet resulted in a production model to be released to the public, but Former VW chairman Dr Ferdinand Piëch actually drove the L1 to the VW shareholders’ meeting in Hamburg from his office in Wolfsburg which lies about 84 miles South of the German port. Piëch recorded 317.4mpg with an average speed of 43.5mph. The two passenger car is equipped with a carbon fiber body, 299cc single-cylinder diesel engine, anti lock brakes, driver’s airbag and an electronic stability program.  The L1’s price tag of  $25,900 was much higher than what the German automotive company targeted for consumers. The UK Telegraph followed the progress of the L1 over the years reported that the project had been scrapped and later restarted.  The L1 has design challenges such as the passenger having to sit bobsled style with their legs around the drivers seat as well as excessive noise and vibration adding to passenger discomfort. Piëch now heads VW’s supervisory board and is still working on fuel efficient vehicles for the German automaker.   The L1 appeared to be a stepping stone and a learning tool to design more efficient vehicles.  Piëch said, “We will never build a one-litre car, but it could give us the knowledge to build a two-litre car.” The VW company also introduced a 3 liter vehicle, the Lupo, which seats four and goes about 78 miles to a gallon of fuel.

"," The allegations in the video are “a stew of untruths” according to a July 26, 2011 article in Tacoma’s News Tribune , which debunked the video commentary produced by Dr. William B. Mount.  Mount, a resident of Tacoma, posted the video on the popular video sharing site YouTube back in February and it went viral by mid July. The News Tribune performed a fact check with the Tacoma Housing Authority and reported that 97% of the residents in this Salisham community are U.S. Citizens.  They also found that Mount used figures from a 2000 census to base his income claims for that area.   The Tacoma Housing Authority told the News Tribune that the $225 million project funds did not come from the Social Security budget, as Mount had claimed, but from a combination of public and private funds from investors at a ratio of $1 to $1.73 to furnish capital needed for the residential construction. One of the claims in Dr. Mount’s commentary is that refugees in U.S. are paid $2642 per month.  TruthOrFiction.Com investigated this eRumor and found that there is no such policy in the U.S. that grants such a large amount to refugees.   This myth actually originated from an editorial about a Canadian policy to help refugees entering Canada.

"Don’t Eat Tilapia Because it Comes From China-Disputed!","2015-03-17 18:06:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tilapia/"," This is a forwarded email that warns not to eat tilapia because it comes from China. "," This eRumor has more to do with the controversy of consuming wild caught fish over fish that is farm raised.  China is a major producer of farm raised tilapia but sanitation conditions of ponds may not be as big of a concern when compared to dumping of  chemicals and drugs into the water where these tasty fish are raised. According to the seafood watch fact sheet by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California, tilapia is a fresh water snapper that is farmed in ponds, closed re-circulating systems or tank systems.  About 40% of the world’s tilapia comes from China.  Other countries that farm tilapia in mass production are the U.S., Canada, Ecuador, and Taiwan.  The fish is a native to Africa and is considered a “fast-growing tropical species.”  The fact sheet also said that it “is the fourth most-consumed seafood in the United States after shrimp, tuna and salmon.” Consuming fish has health benefits but experts say that wild caught fish is preferable to those raised on a farm.  This according to a November 19, 2012 article by the Washington Post that warned of “heavy use of chemicals — including pesticides and antibiotic and antifungal drugs — in many aquaculture operations,” a process to help maintain the health of fish in overcrowded habitats.  The article also said that the experts suggested that it was healthier to eat farmed fish than no fish at all.  Moderation was the key to a healthier life by including half a pound of fish in the weekly diet. The allegation that farm raised tilapia in China were being fed chicken and pig feces also remains unproven. “In many cases, fish farmed in Asia and imported to the US have been raised on diets of chicken and pig feces.” This according to a July 15, 2013 article by MSNBC but in an update at the bottom of this same article cites a denial by a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “ FDA spokesperson Theresa Eisenman flatly denied that the widespread practice of feeding feces to farmed fish occurs.” Eisenman said, “We are not aware of evidence to support the claim that this practice is occurring in China, Both domestic and imported seafood products are required to meet the same food safety standards. If FDA had information that an aquaculture product was raised in a manner that would violate FDA’s food safety requirements, that product would not be allowed entry into the United States.” Posted 01/19/14 ","Miscellaneous"

"Target Stores Won’t Fund Veterans Projects-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/target-viet/"," There are different messages urging you to avoid buying anything at Target stores because the company turned down a request for funds for a Vietnam veterans memorial wall, is owned by the French, won’t allow collections for Toys For Tots at Christmas, and won’t give reservists call for active military duty continued health insurance coverage. "," This is quite an assault on Target stores and is becoming an example of how a rumor can mushroom and pick up momentum along the way. It started with a man named Dick Forrey. He is listed as being with Howard County Vietnam Veterans in the state of Indiana.  He says that he did have the experiences both with the local Target store and the Target corporate offices as is described in one of the stories and did originate an email expressing his displeasure.  It is not true, however, that Target categorically refuses to fund Veteran’s projects and even Forrey is upset with how large this eRumor has spread. The Target company is sending a written response to people who inquire about the Forrey story that says that Target gives $2 million per week in the communities where stores are located. The Target letter says a veteran (referring to Forrey) approached a local store in March, 2002 for a $100 donation to a “moving wall” project. The response says that any donations by local stores are not in cash but in gift certificates or volunteer time. Cash is given by the corporate office and in response to official requests for grants. The letter says that the veteran who asked for the donation should have been given grant information from the store, but was not. The Target response also says that the company makes donations in three general areas: education, arts and family violence prevention. The company is happy to donate to any veterans causes that would fit within those guidelines. So while it’s true that donations would not be given to a veterans project per se, they would be given if the veterans project is within the guidelines. Regarding Target’s ownership, the company is on record as a U.S. firm based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and always has been. There is no foreign ownership in its past or present that we’ve been able to find or been presented with evidence about.   Target is a public corporation and a list of their executive officers and board of directors can be found on the investor section of the company’s website . Regarding benefits for reservists on active duty, this has been a big issue since so many reservists were called in for service in the Middle East and the National Committee for Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve has been a watchdog of companies and how they treat reservists. They list target in the “Outstanding Employer” category which means it has “gone above and beyond the requirements of the law in support of their National Guard and Reserve employees.” So how did such a completely false email come into being? It’s easy to suspect a conspiracy or organized effort against Target but from our viewpoint this appears to have gotten started with the Dick Forrey letter and as others read it and got angry over it, they added other false charges in order to stack the deck. In 2011 this eRumor once again gained momentum after Target began operations in Canada.   Someone added “2013” to the subject of the eRumor and in the summer of that year this oldie rose from the ashes and once again went viral on the World Wide Web.

"," There are several organized protests across the nation by members of group called Tax Day Tea Party . They used this name from the inspiration of the famous event of 1773 in Boston that sparked the American Revolution and was popularly known as “The Boston Tea Party.” According to their site, “Tax Day Tea Party is a national collaborative grassroots effort organized by Smart Girl Politics, Top Conservatives on Twitter, the DontGo Movement and many other online groups/coalitions.” Concerns over the bailouts, the 2009 Stimulus Package, the threat of higher taxes and wasteful government spending caused the group to put up a website where viewers can find local information on rallies called “Tea Parties”. So far, there have been many such rallies in more than twenty states across the country that have been attended by massive groups of people. The first wave of rally’s began February 27,2009 when “an estimated 30,000 Americans took to the street in 40+ cities across the country in the first nationwide ‘Tea Party’ protest. Organizers of the February 27th events pledged to continue on with an even bigger and better protest to follow the first. With April 15th being ‘Tax Day’, it was decided to schedule the second round of Tea Party protests to ride alongside the tax deadline.” The Tax Day Tea Party web site encourages people to organize rallies in their local area but to prevent duplication and to ensure that all efforts are within the law they suggest that organizers consult the guide posted on their website. Click here for Tax Day Tea Party guide. According to the report, the “Teabag DC” idea suggesting that taxpayers to send a teabag to the Whitehouse came from the group called “ ReTea Party” .  The Fox reporter speculated that no teabags would actually arrive at the Pennsylvania Avenue address but some nearby post office instead. This eRumor took on the name of “The New American Tea Party” , one of the originators of the February 27th rallies but they are not endorsing the effort of sending teabags to Washington.  They posted a disclaimer on their web site saying, “We have received hundreds of questions about an email circulating that urges folks to send tea to Washington on April 1st or April 15th. This effort is not endorsed by the New American Tea Party, so we can’t answer any questions about it.

In our investigation we detected that some of the facts in this eRumor were incorrect. The first example in the eRumor alleged that actor, and President Lincoln assassin, John Wilkes Booth was a member of theDemocratic party. Booth was a member of the Know Nothing Party. Charles J. Guiteau, the man who shot and killed President James Garfield was a Republican. He wrote a speech for James Garfield. Guiteau shot Garfield because the president did not appoint him as an ambassador. Not much is known about the political affiliations of John Hinckley, Jr., who attempted to kill President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, but there was a Bush connection with the family. Hinkley’s father was a financial supporter of the campaign of George H. W. Bush when he ran for office in 1980. Also, Hinkley’s father, Scott, was scheduled to have dinner with Neil Bush, the son of the vice president, on the day after the attempted assassination of President Reagan. The McDonalds mass murderer was committed by James Huberty not James Hubert, as noted in the eRumor. We found no evidence that he was a Democrat. Huberty’s online biographies indicated that he was a survivalist and obsessed with Soviet agression. He believed in an impending breakdown of society, economic collapse, and that he was in the advent of a nuclear war. Because of this he had invested in non-perishable foods and an arsenal of weapons. Larry Ashbrook, not Larry Asbrook, was the man who killed seven people attending a concert by Christian rock group Forty Days at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. No political affiliation was found. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, was a immigrant from South Korea.

As with many forwarded emails, the criticism did not include any example of what the writer of the email claimed was the difference between what Snopes.com reported and what Barack Obama had actually said. Snopes.com is an excellent site that has become an authoritative source for information about urban legends and forwarded emails. We regard David and Barbara Mikkelson, the founders and operators of Snopes.com, as colleagues and professional researchers who have earned a good reputation for what they do. We can give a unique perspective on this story because we do the same kind of work as Snopes.com and have sometimes been the target of similar criticism. We’ve got a collection of emails that have come to TruthOrFiction.com accusing us of being “right wing whackos” as well as “liberals” and “communists.” We’ve been suspected of being owned and operated by both Republicans and Democrats. We’ve been called “Christian propagandists” as well as “atheists pretending to be neutral.” We occasionally receive emails that have elaborate theories about who “really” owns us and what our “real” motives are. The bottom line is that if you try to report the truth, there will be those who don’t like the truth you’ve reported and who will develop suspicions about why you did. That, in our view, is what is happening with Snopes. The 2008 presidential campaign has been one of the most intense and unique in our nation’s history and has prompted more political eRumors than any presidential campaign in our experience, especially about Barack Obama. These anti-Snopes emails have probably been prompted by someone who does not like Barack Obama and does not like the fact that Snopes (or TruthOrFiction.com for that matter) has debunked some of the emails that are not true about him. One of the versions of the eRumor mentions TruthOrFiction.com and recommends our site. We appreciate that, but we want to say for the record that we’ve had nothing to do with this eRumor about Snopes.com and we condemn it. Snopes Exposed? In August 2010 this rumor morphed when President Obama appointed Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. An August 4, 2010 World Net Daily article alleged that this was a political payback for several cases questioning the President’s citizenship that were denied by Kagan.  Snopes reported that these allegations were false.  Shortly after that inboxes were flooded with emails with the subject header “Snopes Exposed!” alleging that they lied about their findings to protect Obama.  TruthOrFiction.com also investigated this rumor and found that World Net Daily released the story but the filed court cases did not question the President’s birth records.

"Sandy Hook Shooting Was Staged by the Government-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sandy-hook-shooting-conspiracy-theory/"," Blog posts and articles circling the Web allege that the federal government staged the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School to shore up support for new gun control laws. "," Many of the theories surrounding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are based on personal opinions that cannot be definitively proven true or false — so this eRumor remains unproven. An official review of state and local law enforcement agencies’ response to the shooting, however, contradicts the claim that there were irregularities in the police response to the situation. A Connecticut Police Chiefs Association report found that officers made entry to the building less than nine minutes after the first emergency call was received at 9:35 a.m. The shooter committed suicide within two minutes of officers arriving. The report continued: State and local police continued to search the building and quickly triaged any victims they discovered. A Newtown Officer found a critically injured child, since EMS had not been cleared to approach the building; the officer scooped up the child and sprinted toward the EMS staging area. This is recorded by in-car video at 09:56:16 hours. Soon after, officers and troopers found other children and adults in the immediate vicinity of the suspect and led them out of the building. In-car video shows the wounded and trapped being shuttled out of the building from 09:58:39 hours on. This continued until the building was emptied. That report states that New Town, Conn., police officers correctly prioritized neutralizing the shooter before providing clearance for emergency response efforts to proceed. No information is available regarding what time the first media broadcast went live from the scene, so it’s impossible to determine what phase of the response television viewers first witnessed. Media outlets traditionally do not broadcast live footage from active crime scenes that involve shooters because it could allow the perpetrator to gain a tactical advantage over officers who are responding, or expose viewers to gruesome images of victims. The claim that New Hampshire Gov. Dan Malloy said he had been spoken to about how “something like this may happen” on Dec. 12, 2012, is true, according to a video of the press conference. “Earlier today, a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community,” Malloy said. “The lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to in attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident.” The claim that Robbie Parker, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School victim Emily Parker, is an actor appears to be based on speculation, not credible evidence.

"," We don’t know who the original author is of this email or his or her motives, but there is a lot said about Pyrex and the company that makes Pyrex that is incorrect. Pyrex is one of the most widely used products in American households and has been used safely for decades. According to World Kitchen, the makers of Pyrex, there has never been a recall of Pyrex or any concern about its safety on the part of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Like all glassware, Pyrex needs to be used according to instructions.  At the time of our investigation we found on the Pyrex website an advisory to consumers not to subject the product to extreme temperature changes, such as putting a Pyrex dish directly on a burner, under a broiler, adding liquid to a hot dish or placing a hot dish on a cold or wet surface.  Under those circumstances the glass can break. The claim that the current makers of Pyrex abandoned borosilicate glass in favor or poorer quality soda lime glass is false. World Kitchen told TruthOrFiction.com that Pyrex has been made from heat-strengthened soda lime glass for about 60 years and that the switch was first made by Corning, not World Kitchen.  The company added, “Consumers should know that soda lime glass, such as that used to make PYREX glass bakeware, is significantly more resistant to breaking on impact than borosilicate glass and comparably resistant to breakage caused by severe temperature changes.” It is also false that World Kitchen is not a U.S. company.  It is an American firm and Pyrex is manufactured in the U.S.A.. Posted instructions from the Pyrex website Any glass bakeware product can break if it is not used properly. For that reason, we want to remind consumers to review the PYREX® Safety and Usage Instructions provided with our products. While not a substitute for reviewing the entire Safety and Usage Instructions, set forth below are selected highlights. PYREX GLASS BAKEWARE SAFETY AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: NEVER use on top of the stove, under a broiler, in a toaster oven, or place over oven vent or pilot light. AVOID severe hot to cold temperature changes, including: DO NOT add liquid to hot dish. DO NOT place hot dish or glass cover in sink. DO NOT immerse hot dish in water. DO NOT place hot dish on cold or wet surfaces. Handle hot ovenware and glass covers with dry potholder. ALWAYS add a small amount of liquid to the vessel prior to baking foods that release liquids while cooking. DO NOT overheat oil or butter in microwave. Use minimum amount of cooking time. DO NOT use or repair any item that is chipped, cracked or scratched. CARE INSTRUCTIONS: To loosen baked-on-food, allow glass to cool, then soak. If scouring is necessary, use only plastic or nylon cleaning pads with nonabrasive cleansers.

May wrote the Christmas poem “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” in 1939.  We have researched dozens of sources which include interviews with May himself and his children and there is never a mention that he did this for comforting his child from the death of her mother. Robert L. May worked as a catalog advertising copywriter for Montgomery Wards & Company when the company, recognizing his skills in poetry,  asked him for ideas on a booklet of illustrated poems as a promotional give away. May’s wife, Evelyn, died of cancer in July of 1939, according to his account in a December 22, 1975 Gettysburg Times article.  This is one year later from the account of the eRumor. May also had a daughter, name Barbara, and according to a Paul Harvey Rest of the Story article she was recruited to help in development of the story to make sure Rudolf  would appeal to children.  May would read to her his verses and if she inquired about the meaning of any words he would simplify the vocabulary. May pitched his story to Montgomery Wards executives about the ugly duckling reindeer with three possible names.  The company turned down the idea and asked May to return with a second draft.  When May came back with his improved story that included sketches by an illustrator the company executive accepted it, named the red nosed reindeer Rudolf and the rest is history. The stores distributed 2,400,000 copies of the booklet during the 1939 and 1946 Christmas season promotions.  The year 1946 proved to be such a financial success for the company that the executives awarded May with the copyrights of his popular Christmas story. This eRumor may have been sparked by a story in the book “ Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas ” by Ace Collins that said May created the character of Rudolf to bring hope and comfort to his grieving daughter, Barbara, after the death of his wife.  Collins told TruthOrFiction.Com that his source for this version of the story came from someone working in the Montgomery Wards & Co. public relations department. The story of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer has been released world wide in twenty-five languages. In 1949 Johnny Marks, May’s brother-in-law, adapted the story to music and Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer was immortalized by singing cowboy star, Gene Autry.  Over two million copies of the recording sold. updated 12-22-10 ","Miscellaneous"

It is not a religion, but rather a    psychological mind-training base on universal spiritual themes.” Marianne Williamson is a popular lecturer who has authored several books    and promotes z”A Course in Miracles.” A Course In Miracles first came out in 1976.  Psychologist Helen    Schucman describes herself as the “scribe” of the book rather than the    author.  She said that she and fellow psychologist William Thetford    “scribed” the book from an “inner source.”  Schucman has said that it    was channeled to her by Jesus Christ. The course of teachings makes frequent reference to Jesus and uses    Christian terminology, but many Evangelical Christian teachers and    apologists regard it has heretical. The text of this  eRumor is from an article written by Warren Smith,    a former new ager who was a devotee of A Course in Miracles and who is now    an Evangelical Christian. In March, 2008, a video began circulating widely on the Internet that used    some similar material as in the forwarded email version. Among the statements in the video include: “Who you are requires no     belief.” This is a quote from Eckhart Tolle a featured guest of Oprah’s.      He is the author of the book The Power of Now. “Heaven is not a location     but an inner realm of consciousness.” This, too, is an Eckhart Tolle quote from his book A New Earth. “The man on the cross is     an archatypel [sic] image, he is every man and woman.” This is described second-hand as a Tolle quote, but we have not     confirmed that. “My mind is part of     God’s, I am very holy, my holiness is my salvation and my salvation     comes from me.” One of the lessons in A Course of Miracles is titled “My Holiness is     My Salvation.”  The statement “My salvation comes from me. It cannot     come from anywhere else” is a quote from the Course of Miracles     (workbook, lesson 70). “There is no sin.” This is a quote from A Course in Miracles.  “ The     exercises teach sin is not real, and all that you believe must come from     sin will never happen, for it has no cause. Accept Atonement with an     open mind, which cherishes no lingering belief that you have made a     devil of God’s Son. There is no sin. We practice with this thought as     often as we can today, because it is the basis for today’s idea.”      Workbook, lesson 101. “Do not make the     pathetic error of clinging to the Old Rugged Cross. The only message of the     crucifixion is that you can overcome the cross.” From A Course in     Miracles.  “ Do not make the     pathetic human error of “clinging to the old rugged cross.” The only     message of the crucifixion was that we can overcome the cross.      Unless you do so, you are free to crucify yourself as often as you     choose. But this is not the gospel I intended to offer you.”      Chapter 4, The Root of All Evil. Updated 4/3/08 ","Miscellaneous"

There are indications in the transcript that this may be a hoax. Matthews is a Roman Catholic as well as a professional interviewer.  A professional would not have begun an interview by addressing a Catholic Cardinal with “Welcome Cardinal.”  The correct protocol when addressing a Catholic Cardinal is “Your Eminence,” according to “How to Address Church Officials” found posted on the website Catholiceducation.org .  Cardinals may also be addressed by “Your Lordship” but it would be considered bad form to say “Welcome Cardinal” without including the clergyman’s last name.

"Social Security for Illegal Immigrants who have not contributed? Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/petition-illegals/"," A couple of these are circulating, both in the form of petitions. One says that the U.S. Senate has voted to allow illegal aliens to collect on Social Security even though they have not paid into the Social Security System. Another is an internet petition originated by Californians that is to be sent to President Bush, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and several members of Congress from California.  It says that the U.S. Senate voted to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants and protests it..  It asks that citizenship be required for eligibility for Social Services, that no free services or funding be given to illegal immigrants, and that no college education be provided free to illegals either. "," First, Internet petitions have, so far, been of limited or no value.  They do not bear the same weight of signed petitions since anybody who wants to take the time could generate them and just make up the names.  These petitions also depend on someone to ultimately send them to the right addresses, which is not a reliable way to get them there. Second, let’s look at each of the issues in the eRumors. The Senate Vote on Social Security that generated this petition was in May, 2006. The effect of that vote was to allow language in other legislation on the issue to proceed.  It would not have granted Social Security benefits to all illegal aliens but it would have allowed illegal aliens who had already paid into Social Security to accrue the benefits of their contributions.  The Senate went on to pass a controversial immigration bill but it differed greatly from a version passed in the House of Representatives. Social Security As of this writing, Illegal immigrants are not benefiting much from Social Security.  It’s technically illegal to hire an undocumented worker so theoretically there should not be any paying into Social Security.  But because of so many illegal workers who use bogus Social Security cards to get jobs, billions of dollars of Social Security deductions are made each year as well as employer payments into Social Security on behalf of those workers. Illegals are not supposed to collect on Social Security and because their Social Security numbers are manufactured, they cannot collect so the money has become a part of the controversy over Illegal immigration.  There have been some estimates that more than $60 billion a year are being paid into the system because of illegal immigrants, money that would disappear if the immigrants did. Immigration reform being debated in Congress could affect all this such as if amnesty is granted to illegal aliens currently residing in the U.S. or if illegal aliens are given some kind of participation in the Social Security system.  There is no legislation, however, that would give illegal aliens Social Security payments if they have not paid into Social Security. Social Services Let’s look at this from the standpoint of California since that is the concern of the petition and is the state with the largest population of illegal immigrants. A wide range of services are available in California for illegal immigrants including health care and education for children. College Tuition At present in-state college tuition rates are available to undocumented immigrants as long as they meet other standards such as residency requirements.

In 1852 the HMS Resolute set off on a 2 – 3 year mission along with four other ships to the Arctic.  This was a mission to  investigate the disappearance of two ships, the Erebus and Terror, which left England in 1845 in search of the North West Passage.

As a gesture of peace and esteem Resolute was repaired, refitted and eventually returned to England.  In 1878 the ship was decommissioned and Queen Victoria ordered a desk to be fashioned from the wood of the Resolute.  She presented this desk as a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880. According to the White House Museum web site, every president since Hayes has used the Resolute Desk either in the Oval Office or a private study in the Executive Mansion with the exception of Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford.

Here is the complete opinion piece: The National Anthem isn’t a Pop Song By Mark Corallo I’ve heard quite a bit of criticism of Christina Aguilera’s embarrassing rendition of our national anthem prior to kick-off Sunday night. Most of the comments have been focused on her botching the lyrics. Fair enough. But why should we be so critical of a pop star who probably has no idea of the origins of “The Star Spangled Banner” or any sense that the song’s designation as our national anthem makes it about all of us, not about her moment on the stage? She is no different than the dozens of pop stars who over the years have treated the national anthem like a tone poem open to their artistic interpretation, no matter how bad or inappropriate that interpretation may be. Granted, Christina’s was worse than several we’ve been forced to endure prior to past Super Bowls, World Series, NBA All Star Games and other sporting events, but not by much. By today’s standards, hers was pretty much par for the course. She just happened to bogey the lyrics as well as murder the tune. Like most human beings, I love music. I have a tremendous amount of respect for musicians and performers of all kinds. Theirs is not an easy profession, no matter how much money, fame and success they attain. I couldn’t get through the day without them. But as an Army veteran in a family of veterans, the national anthem is sacred to me. Not because it’s a beautiful melody, or because it’s a great piece of poetry. It is neither. It is sacrosanct because it is about the flag that represents the God-given freedom we all have defended. I still stand at attention when I hear it. It is not a pop ballad or a soul tune. Nor is it a Broadway standard or a heavy metal song. It is not something that the American Idol judges should ever have to critique (though Randy would undoubtedly declare any rendition of it “pitchy”). It is a song about the courage and devotion shown by a group of Americans who in the course of a raging British naval bombardment refused to let the Stars and Stripes fall, no matter the cost to life and limb. And it became a song about the kind of nation we have been and still are, through war and peace, boom and bust. It is about the never-say-die, never-give-in, never-yield attitude that has been the hallmark of our national character and our military’s steadfast defense of freedom from Valley Forge to Fort McHenry to St. Lo to Inchon to Baghdad and Kandahar. It’s about firemen and policemen running into the World Trade Center on 9/11. It’s about that flag flying proudly and defiantly over the land of the free and the home of the brave. So, with all the kindness I can muster, I give this one piece of advice to the next pop star who is asked to sing the national anthem at a sporting event: save the vocal gymnastics and the physical gyrations for your concerts. Just sing this song the way you were taught to sing it in kindergarten — straight up, no styling. Sing it with the constant awareness that there are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines watching you from bases and outposts all over the world. Don’t make them cringe with your self-centered ego gratification. Sing it as if you are standing before a row of 86-year-old WWII vets wearing their Purple Hearts, Silver Stars and flag pins on their cardigans and you want them to be proud of you for honoring them and the country they love — not because you want them to think you are a superstar musician. They could see that from the costumes, the makeup and the entourages. Sing “The Star Spangled Banner” with the courtesy and humility that tells the audience that it is about America, not you.

"Netflix Customers May be Eligible to Receive a Cash Payment or Gift Card from a Settlement Involving Netflix and Wal-Mart-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/netflix-wal-mart-settlement/"," An email from OnlineDVDclass.com says that if you were a Netflix subscriber between May 19, 2005 to September 2, 2011 you may be eligible for compensation from a class action suit involving Walmart and Netflix. "," It’s true that some Netflix subscribers may be eligible to receive a portion of a settlement from a class action lawsuit involving Netflix and Walmart — but the deadline to file claims has already passed. The settlement applies to those who subscribed to a Netflix mail order DVD rental plan between May 2005 and September 2011. The deadline to file a claim was in February 2012, however, so anyone who has not already done so won’t be eligible for a cash payment. Back in 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against Walmart Stores Inc., Walmart.com USA LLC and Netflix alleging that the companies had violated anti-trust law. The companies entered into an agreement that sent all of Walmart’s mail order DVD rental subscribers (yes, Walmart briefly had a DVD rental service) to Netflix. In exchange, Walmart promoted Nextflix on its website and received 10% of revenues from its former subscribers and a $36 “bounty” for every new subscriber that came through Walmart’s website, according to the lawsuit filed against Walmart . The class action lawsuit filed against Walmart and Netflix alleged that the agreement “reflected an illegal allocation of the online DVD-rental market.” Both companies were also accused of “conspiracy to monopolize the online DVD-rental market.” Walmart reached a settlement in 2011, and a judge dismissed the case against Netflix. After years of appeals and legal rangling, the settlement reached in the Walmart case was finally made final in February 2015, according onlinedvvdclass.com . Terms of that settlement were negotiated back in 2011. Walmart was ordered to pay $27.25 million in cash and gift cars to settle the lawsuit, but about 25% of that was to be set aside to pay for attorney’s fees. The suit’s lead plaintiffs, the Netflix subscribers who brought the original complaint, were to receive $5,000 each. The remaining money would be set divvied out to remaining Netflix subscribers who filed a claim before February 2012, CNN Money reported back when the settlement was finalized. It’s not clear how many Netflix subscribers filed a claim to receive a slice of the settlement, but the company had about 24 million subscribers who would have been eligible by the end of September 2011. So, it’s true that some Netflix subscribers are eligible for a cash or gift card payout — but it’s too late to claim it unless you filed a claim back in 2012. Those who did file a claim on time were expected to receive their payout on November 5, 2015. A previous version of this story was published on 11/17/11: The   lawsuit is real. It is against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,  Walmart.com USA LLC and Netflix, Inc.  It seeks money on behalf of current and former Netflix subscribers is real.  It has not yet been settled and notifications as to where to file a claim form have been sent out to Netflix customers by email.   Additional information on the lawsuit and how Netflix customers may collect was put up on the Internet at http://www.OnlineDVDclass.com . According to this site, plaintiffs in the class action suit claimed that the two companies reached an unlawful agreement under which Wal-Mart would stop renting DVDs online and Netflix would not sell new videos on DVD. The deadline to submit a Claim Form is February 14, 2012 and it can be done over the Internet or by requesting a form by calling 1-877-389-4469.

"U.S. Government Developing Insect Spy Drones-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mosquito-drone/"," Reports allege that the U.S. government is developing an insect spy drone the size of a mosquito that will be able to capture photos, sound recordings and DNA samples. "," Insect spy drones have been in development by the U.S. military and a number of universities for years, but the extent of the technology’s functionality is unknown. In 2008, the Air Force Research Laboratory set its sights on developing a tiny, armed drone that could be used by U.S. Special Forces to track and terminate “high-value targets,” Wired.com reports . The goal of the project, dubbed “Project Anubis,” was described in the Air Force’s 2008 budget as the development of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that “carries sensors, data links and munitions payload to engage time-sensitive fleeting targets in complex environments,” Wired reports. The fate of Project Anubis is unknown, but similar micro drones have been used and tested in the battlefield. U.S. forces in Afghanistan reportedly tested the Black Hornet drone , which is about the size of a hummingbird, in 2013. The Wasp drone, which weighs less than a pound and measures about 28 inches, has also been used by the military. Schools like Harvard, MIT and Norte Dame are developing micro-robotic insect drone technology, too. Harvard’s RoboBees are being developed to pollinate field crops, explore hazardous environments and carryout military surveillance. It appears that insect-sized micro drones may be a reality in the future, but it’s unknown how close we are to that point. Posted 09/25/14 ","Miscellaneous"

Frank Larison,   a veteran of the Vietnam War who served in the USMC for 14 years, was   ordered by the board of the Woodlands II on the Creek HOA to remove USMC   decals from his car in mid 2009. The group said car decals were   prohibited under deed restrictions and threatened to fine Larison $50 a day if he failed to remove them. The Dallas   News reported that the   HOA quickly backed down in response to a “barrage of critical media   reports.” However, the story re-surfaced in November 2014 when a number   of websites and blogs began re-reporting the   story as current news.

"3-Year-Old Dog Bite Victim Asked to Leave by a Mississippi KFC Restaurant-Disputed!","2015-03-17 18:06:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kfc-pit-bull-survivor/"," Victoria Wilcher, age 3, was left scarred after a pit bull attack. She and her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, were asked to leave a KFC by an employee who told them Victoria’s face was disturbing the other diners. This story went viral on social media after Mullins wrote about it on her Facebook news feed. "," The incident in Jackson, Miss. was reported to be true, but KFC not only apologized to the Wilcher family but said that the company will assist them with medical bills. This according to a June 17, 2014, article by New York Daily News. Recent developments allege that this could have possibly been a hoax, according to a June 24, 2014, article by USA Today, which said an independent investigator is looking into the matter after an anonymous tip was received by the the Laurel Leader-Call in Laurel, Miss. KFC spokesperson Rick Maynard told reporters, “We have apologized to Victoria’s family and are committed to assisting them.” Maynard added “The company is making a $30,000 donation to assist with her medical bills. The entire KFC family is behind Victoria.” Earlier this April, the child was attacked by a pit bull that belonged to her grandfather, Donald Mullins, which left her face scarred and paralyzed. Mullins shot and killed two of his pit bulls after the incident, and a third dog was euthanized. He was later arrested and charged with child-endangerment. Reaction to various various maulings by pit bulls has resulted in a ban on the breed in 29 municipalities and counties in the Magnolia State, according to an April 11 , 2014, article by the Clarion-Ledger. The article said that in 2010, the city of Jackson tried to pass “two ordinances that would ban pit bulls, but both failed after opposition from the city’s animal control chief, dog owners and some members of the City Council.” According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals(ASPCA), pit bulls have a bad reputation, but it may not be entirely the fault of the canine. On its website , the ASPCA wrote: Despite this bad rap, a well-bred, well-socialized and well-trained pit bull is one of the most delightful, intelligent and gentle dogs imaginable. It is truly a shame that the media continues to portray such a warped image of this beautiful, loyal and affectionate breed. Pit bulls once enjoyed a wonderful reputation.

"," This eRumor began circulating in 2006 at a time when there were public protests by immigrants and their supporters over proposed changes in Immigration law. It is one of those forwarded emails that loses a lot of credibility because the writer didn’t identify himself or herself or what school was talking being described. It has to be classed as either opinion or fabrication because there is no way of authenticating what the person claims. In 2007 someone tacked on some additional comment at the end of the eRumor and it began circulating again.  The added text described some of the benefits enjoyed by Illegal immigrants which, in the writer’s opinion, offsets the “cheap labor” the immigrants may be providing. Let’s take those one at a time: He qualifies for Section 8 housing and subsidized rent- Fiction! Section 8 is a government program that provides subsidies for housing for low income families.  It is supposed to go to U.S. citizens, however, and proof of citizenship is required to quality.  Any illegal immigrants in Section 8 housing are there through fraud or are living with a family member who does qualify for it. He qualifies for food stamps – Fiction! To qualify for food stamps you must either be a U.S. citizen or a legal immigrant. He qualifies for free (no deductible, no co-pay) health care- Truth! & Fiction! Illegal immigrants do not qualify for programs like Medicaid, but federal rules require hospitals to provide emergency care to critically ill or injured patients who come through the emergency room regardless of citizenship or ability to pay.  Many illegal immigrants have made the emergency room their routine place of seeking medical help. His children get free breakfasts and lunches at school- Truth! Provision of education and free lunches and breakfasts at qualifying schools is without regard to the citizenship of the students or their families. He requires bilingual teachers and books- Truth! This is a part of the requirement of providing educational opportunity regardless of citizenship. He qualifies for relief from high energy bills -Fiction!

If they are or become, aged, blind or disabled , they qualify for SSI. Once qualified for SSI they can qualify for Medicare- Fiction! The requirements for qualifying for SSI benefits are complicated but the bottom line is that they are not available to illegal immigrants.  For an immigrant to qualify for SSI, according to the Social Security Administration, that person must qualify under one of 8 categories to be in the United States and must have contributed into the Social Security system for a minimum number of quarters.

"," This is a hoax. The original email, which started circulating in 2007, claimed that the    University of Kentucky had removed the Holocaust from its curriculum. The University of Kentucky told TruthOrFiction.com that no such decision    had been made about removing studies about the Holocaust. Then in 2008 another version of the University of Kentucky eRumor started    circulating that included a picture of General Dwight Eisenhower and a    caption that said it was him visiting the Dachau death camp in Germany.     It also said that Eisenhower anticipated a day when people would deny that    such atrocities took place and not only ordered a lot of photographs to be    taken but for local citizens to be given tours of the camp and even help    bury the dead. First, the picture circulated with the email is from Dachau but is not a    photo of Dwight Eisenhower.  The picture was included in a report on    Dachau prepared by the Office of Strategic Services Section of the Seventh    Army and is depicted as a photo during liberation of the camp. Eisenhower’s first view of the horrors of the Holocaust was not at Dachau,    but at another prisoner camp in Germany known as Ohrdruf.  He was    accompanied by Generals Omar Bradley and George Patton. In a letter to    General George Marshall on April 15, 1945 (preserved in the Eisenhower    Presidential Library), Eisenhower describes his experience.  He told    Marshall, “I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to    give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future,    there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to    ‘propaganda'”.  On April 18, Eisenhower sent pictures taken during    his visit at Ohrdruf to English Prime Minister Winston Churchill with a    short note that said “I think they tell their own story.” The eRumor is identical to one that circulated about the reported removal    of Holocaust studies from schools in Great Britain, which was also false.

"," This eRumor contains false claims and generalizations about Japan’s treatment of Muslims. The Japanese government regularly welcomes political leaders from Islamic and Arabic states. In July 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the Islamic Diplomatic Corps to Japan, an official government press release reports. “I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,” Prime Minister Abe said. “I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence….” Islamic and Arabic studies are also not restricted in Japan, as the eRumor suggests. It’s true that the International University of Japan in Tokyo does not offer courses on Arabic or Islamic languages — however, the only language courses the university offers are English and Japanese, according to the university’s website . Still, the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo features an extensive offering of such courses, and it regularly features political and academic leaders from various Islamic and Arabic states, according to the school’s website . The eRumor’s claim that Muslims cannot become Japanese citizens is also false, according to a Japanese blog that specializes in immigration issues called “Becoming Legally Japanese.” “Because there is no place on the written online application for one’s religion, the Ministry of Justice can’t publish statistics showing the religions (or races) of naturalization candidates; they can only publish sex and former nationality statistics,” the blog reports. “However, looking at the nationality statistics, we can find hundreds of examples of people from Islamic states (ex. Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan) as well as people from nation-states where the official state religion is Islam (ex. Egypt) and greater than 90 percent of the population is Muslim. Doing a quick web search, I can find Japanese immigration lawyers who specialize in people from Indonesia and brag of a 100 percent success rate.” Japan requires special visas for visitors, workers and students who are not from one of 66 countries that Japan has a “general visa exemption arrangement” with, according to an official website . But there are no official travel restrictions on Muslims, or practitioners of any other faith. It’s also untrue that Japan does not allow Arabic or Islamic schools in the country. The International Islamia School Otsuka in Tokyo is just one example. Additionally, the Japanese government funded construction of a number of madrasas that were completed in Afghanistan in December 2012, Pajhwok Afghan News reports . There are also no restrictions on Japanese women marrying Muslim men, according to the Islamic Center of Japan’s website . The eRumor’s allegation that a Japanese woman would be “considered an outcast forever” by her family for marrying a Muslim man — like many other allegations in the eRumor — is a generalization that is impossible to prove or disprove.

In his July 31, 2012 Independent article , Adams wrote, “The site claims I broke its rules because I included Zenkel’s work email address in a Tweet posted on Friday, when America had been forced to watch the opening ceremony on time-delay.” Adams also said that he contacted the Twitter “trust and safety” department to get his account status restored and their response was, “If you would like to request your account to be restored, please respond to this email and confirm that you’ve read and understood our rules.” Adams’ response to the social media giant was included in his article: Evening And sorry for the radio silence. For obvious reasons, my day has been a wee bit busier than normal. I would love my Twitter account to be un-suspended. However you have asked me to “confirm that I have read and understood” your rules. I’ve read, and I have re-read your rules. Clearly I don’t understand them, though, because I have no idea how I broke them. You claim that I posted a “private email address.” I did no such thing. I posted a corporate email address, not a private one. It was, like the work address of every other NBC Universal account holder, written in a very un-private format: firstname.lastname@nbcuni.com. Moreover, it was already easily identifiable to anyone in possession of 30 seconds of free time and access to Google. For example, it had been published online over a year ago, at the link below http://www.fidei.org/2011/06/boycott-nbc-removed-under-god-from.html You will, I am sure, be aware that your own privacy policy, which you have urged me to read, states that “If information was previously posted or displayed elsewhere on the Internet prior to being put on Twitter, it is not a violation of this policy.” Mr Zenkel’s email address HAD been posted on the internet prior to being put on Twitter, Therefore can you explain how my Tweet violated your policy? Or are you making this up as you go along? Moreover, I just received a copy of a written statement from an NBC spokesman called Christopher McCloskey. It was issued via email this evening to Amy Willis, a correspondent at the Daily Telegraph, in answer to her query regarding how NBC’s complaint came to be lodged with Twitter, and how NBC originally became aware of my original Tweet. Mr McCloskey states (and I quote): “Our social media dept was actually alerted to it by Twitter and then we filled out the form and submitted it.” Unless he is lying, this means that my account was suspended after Twitter decided, at its own behest, to get in touch with a commercial partner in order to encourage them to have a hostile journalist removed from the Twitter-sphere. Surely this runs against everything your company is supposed to represent? And surely it completely undermines Twitter’s entire raison d’etre, corporate ethos, etc? Mr McCloskey’s email to Ms Willia also, helpfully, includes contact details for a Twitter spokesman, Rachael Horwitz. Am I to take it that this means NBC and Twitter’s media departments are in some sort cahoots regarding this whole thing? And if so, does this whole thing not have a whiff of fish? I don’t know exactly where I’m meant to go from here, except to say that I really would like a proper explanation of how and why my Twitter account has been suspended. And I’d also quite like to have it un-suspended. Please? Guy The Twitter account of Guy Adams was eventually unsuspended on the morning of July 31, 2012. updated 07/31/12 ","Miscellaneous"

"The film “The Golden Compass” is a controversy among Christians-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/golden-compass/"," A warning about a new film for December, 2007, titled “The Golden Compass”.  There are several emails but all of them say that the film is based on the writings of an atheist author from England and that the film is anti-religious and anti-Christian. "," “The Golden Compass” was scheduled for release December 7, 2007.  The stars include 12-year-old Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, and Ian McKellen. The film is based on a novel titled “Northern Lights” (“The Golden Compass” in the United States), which is the first in a trilogy titled “His Dark Materials” written by English author Phillip Pullman. He first published “Northern Lights” in 1995 followed by “The Subtle Knife” in 1997 and “The Amber Spyglass” in 2000. They are targeted toward children.  The trilogy has resulted in several awards for Pullman including the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children’s Book Award and the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. The main character in the film is a young girl named Lyra (played by Dakota Blue Richards) who lives in a parallel universe to ours. There has been much criticism from Christians about Pullman’s novels and protest against the release of the first film in the series.  The Catholic League has called for a boycott of “The Golden Compass.” Film critic and author Dr. Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and Television commission calls “The Golden Compass” “An atheist’s ‘Narnia’ knockoff,” referring to the best selling books “The Chronicles of Narnia” by C.S. Lewis.  The first film of the Narnia series was released internationally as “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.”   The second Narnia film, “Prince Caspian,” is schedule for release in 2008. Many view Pullman’s books as a response to “The Chronicles of Narnia” but with an emphasis on “scientific materialism” over religion.  Pullman has criticized “The Chronicles of Narnia” as “religious propaganda.”  In 2001 he told Guardian Unlimited “I hate the Narnia books, and I hate them with deep and bitter passion, with their view of childhood as a golden age from which sexuality and adulthood are a falling away.” Baehr describes Pullman as “an avowed atheist who has dedicated his life to undermining Christianity and the church among young readers.”  He says Pullman “represents God as a decrepit and perverse angel in his novels, who captures the dead in a ‘prison camp’ afterlife.”  One fallen angel says: The Authority, God, the  Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father, the  Almighty – those were all names he gave himself. He was never the  creator. He was an angel like ourselves – the first angel, true, the  most powerful, but he was formed of Dust as we are, and Dust is only a  name for what happens when matter begins to understand itself. According to Baehr, one heroine in the story turns from the Church when she realizes “there wasn’t any God at all and … the Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that’s all.” The Church just kept her from finding love, thinking freely and pursuing bodily pleasures like sex.  The Sunday Times describes the story as “…a quest that takes in the literal death of ‘God’, who is no more than a wizened, foetus-like invalid…Lyra releases human beings from attachment to the afterlife.” According to “The Golden Compass” website, a key feature of the film is that “In Lyra’s world, a person’s soul lives on the outside of their body, in the form of a daemon — an animal spirit that accompanies them through life.”  Each of the characters in the film has a daemon, which include birds, monkeys, snow leopards, reptiles, and moths. The web site has a feature to help visitors discover their own daemons by answering a series of questions. There are voices from among Christians who support Pullman.  Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has proposed that “His Dark Materials” be taught in schools as religious education.  His is among voices who view Pullman’s writings as an attack on religious oppression, not Christianity.

"Doctors More Dangerous Than Gun Owners-Humorous Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doctor-deaths/"," The forwarded email compares the rate of accidental deaths between physicians and gun owners and concludes that rate of accidental deaths per physician is much higher than the rate of accidental deaths per gun owner. "," This email is obviously the humorous creation    of a gun enthusiast. We don’t know when it was written but not all of  the statistics    appear accurate. According to the U.S. Department of    Health Services there were about 780,000 licensed physicians in the United    States in 2008, so that figure seems good. Finding statistics that everybody agrees with regarding deaths caused by    doctors is a little more difficult.  Dr. J. Mercola released a book    in 2000 titled Doctors are the Third Leading Cause of Death in the US,    Causing 250,000 Deaths Every Year. His breakdown, however,    largely focuses on errors in hospitals and includes 12,000 deaths by    unnecessary surgery, 7,000 due to medication errors in hospitals, 20,000    due to other errors in hospitals, 80,000 from infections in hospitals, and    106,000 from the negative effects of medications. Regarding gun owners, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA) 2010   Fact Sheet , they tallied in the U.S. between 70 and 80 million.    The NRA fact sheet also said that there are close to 300 million   privately owned firearms in the United States with hand guns counting   for nearly 100 million and that somewhere between 40-45% of American   households have firearms. According to the National Rifle    Association there were 776 accidental deaths from firearms in 2000, a    lower figure than in the email. That’s all interesting to know but the premise of the email is weak and,    as we said, mostly aimed toward humor.  Comparing doctor deaths to    accidental firearm deaths is meaningless, especially because doctors are    dealing with people who are sick in the first place, some of whom are at    high risk for death or have gone through high risk medical procedures.

OKCupid wrote a notice to visitors using Mozilla’s Firefox web browser to read a letter calling for a boycott of Mozilla. Their reason for the protest was Mozilla’s selection of Eich as the company’s new leader, who was described by OKCuptin as “an opponent of equal rights for gay couples.” The article said that Eich made a $1,000 donation to California’s Prop 8, an initiative to ban gay marriage in the state.

He called global warming the “greatest scam in history” in an essay he wrote that year. Coleman said that “environmental extremist, notable politicians among them,” had teamed up with the media industry to create the “wild ‘scientific’ scenario” that global warming was fueled by civilization. Coleman also delivered a speech to the San Diego Chamber of Commerce in 2007 in which he said global warming could be explained by historical climate patterns. “Earth has shifted between two basic climate regimes: ice ages and what paleoclimatologists call ‘interglacial periods,’” Coleman said. “For the past 10 thousand years the Earth has been in an interglacial period. That might well be called nature’s global warming because what happens during an interglacial period is the earth warms up, the glaciers melt and life flourishes. Clearly from our point of view, an interglacial period is greatly preferred to the deadly rigors of an ice age.” Coleman grabbed headlines again in October 2014 when he claimed that polar ice caps had increased and that heat waves had been diminished in recent decades in an open letter that argued against global warming.

The spokesperson also said that the questions dealing with sexuality were only for internal demographic purposes.

He told Breitbart that when he got the survey asking if employees considered themselves an ally of the LGBT community he felt angered and frustrated.

There is no single emergency number in use world wide.  The number 112 is used in some countries but not all, nor is it used in the U.S. for emergency calls.  Many countries also use 119, 999, and 911.  Additionally, not all phones would in all countries to be able to even try dialing a single emergency code. Some mobile phone providers in the U.S. have programmed 112 into their systems to redirect emergency calls to 911, the nation wide emergency telephone number in the U.S. You Can Unlock Your Car Remotely Through a Cell Phone- Fiction! This was an eRumor that previously circulated on its own.  The claim is that if you lock yourself out of your car but have a extra remote switch at your home  you can phone someone at home, have the person hold the switch up to the phone, then you hold your cell phone near your car door and when the button on the other remote is pressed—your car door will open.   This one is also false.  It assumes that car remotes use sound waves to open your door but most of them use radio signals, not sound.  A radio signal will not travel over the audio of a cell phone. There may be hidden battery power in your cell phone- Fiction! If there is a phone that offers this feature, we have not found it. The eRumor claims that if you punch in a certain code on your cell phone you will access reserve power.  It mentions Nokia in particular but the folks at Nokia told TruthOrFiction.com that they do not have any phone with that capability.

This doesn’t work on every phone, but some phones do reveal what is called an International Mobile Equipment identity or “IEMI” number when punching in the code of “*#06#.”  This is especially true for GSM/DCS/PCS phones.  If such a phone is stolen, it can be “greylisted” or “blacklisted.”  Greylisted means that the phone can still be used but can also be tracked.  Blacklisting means that the phone cannot be used.

"The Brutal Murders of Christopher Newsom and Channon Christian-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/christopher-channon/"," The eRumor tells of the horrific kidnapping, torture, and murder of Christopher Newsom and his girlfriend Channon Christian from Knoxville, Tennessee. The story claims that she was forced to watch as Christian’s penis was cut off, he was set on fire, and shot several times.  Then she was allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted for 4 days, chemicals put into her mouth, her breast cut off, then murdered.  According to the eRumor, five people have been arrested for the crimes.  The eRumor asks questions like why the media has not covered the the story more widely such as the Duke University rape case, why people like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are not helping the victim’s families, why the ACLU and the NAACP are not calling for an investigation, and why the FBI is not looking into it as a hate crime.  Then it answers those questions by saying that it must be because the victims were white and the suspects were black. "," Although some of the details of the eRumor are not confirmed, the tragic story of the murders of Christoper Newsom and Channon Christian is true. Authorities say both were raped, tortured, and murdered after being kidnapped on the morning of January 7, 2007.  Four people were convicted and sentenced for their involvement in this crime.   Letalvis Cobbins was found guilty of first degree murder and rape in August 2009 and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.    Lemaricus Davidson was found guilty of first degree murder and rape in October 2009.  Davidson is on death row awaiting his death sentence by lethal injection to be carried out.  George Thomas, after having been found guilty of first degree murder and rape in December 2009 was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  In May 2010 Vanessa Coleman was found not guilty of first degree murder but was found guilty of being a facilitator in the rape and death of Channon Christian.   Coleman was sentence to 53 years in prison. According to published reports, Newsom and Christian went out for dinner on the evening of Saturday, January 6, 2007.  Police say their car was hijacked and the couple was tired up and taken to the apartment of one of the suspects.  There Christian was reportedly raped in Newsom’s presence then Newsom was shot and his body burned.  Police have not confirmed that his penis was cut off and we have not found any credible source for that information.  Police later found a fingerprint on an envelope in Christian’s abandoned car, which led them to the apartment and where they found Christian’s body in a trash can in the kitchen.  She had been dismembered.  Again, police have not confirmed the mutilation of her breast.  Investigators say they later determined that she had been held for at least two days during which she was tortured, raped, and murdered.  Newsom’s body was found by a railroad worker near some railroad tracks in East Knoxville. The story has been covered by both local and national media but not with the intensity of something like the Duke University rape case, in which three white students were charged with raping a black stripper at a party in March, 2006.  All the charges against the students were eventually dropped but the case generated a lot of visibility and controversy along racial lines. The murders of Newsom and Christian have become better known through forwarded emails and blogs than from national media.  It would be difficult, however, to argue that it is because of racial bias.  The O.J. Simpson murder trial was one of the most intensively covered crimes involving a black defendant with white victims.  Rich Buhler, the founder of TruthOrFiction.com, has worked in the news media for more than 40 years.  He said, “There are heartbreaking and horrifying crimes all over the nation every day that you don’t hear about until, for example, you watch a true crime show or read a true crime book.  Newsom and Christian were not only victims of human monsters but also became crime statistics that are, very tragically, all too common.” updated 4/11/12 ","Miscellaneous"

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas released a detailed statement about the case on September 8, 2006.   The statement was partly because of the Internet eRumor. According to the statement, the two Border Patrol agents in the case shot an unarmed man, failed to report the shooting as required, and did not know at the time that they shot him that he had 743 pounds of marijuana in the van he was driving. After a two-week trial, a jury convicted both agents of eleven of the 12 counts in the indictment including assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with serious bodily injury, discharge of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence and willfully violating the rights of the victim, and obstructing justice by defacing the crime scene, lying about the incident. The statement said that the agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean spotted the suspect, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, on February 17, 2005, driving a van near the U.S. Mexico border near Fabens, Texas.  They attempted to stop him for an ID check and the suspect got out of the van and started running toward the border.  The agents stopped him at gunpoint and, according to the statement, he “held his hands up, as if to surrender, with his palms open, and no weapon was in either hand, or evident on his person.”  At one point one of the agents tried to hit the suspect with the butt of his gun and the suspect took off running again.  The U.S. Attorney’s office says the agents fired 15 rounds at the suspect, one of which hit him in the left buttock. The suspect made it into Mexico and got away. It was later discovered that the suspect had been driving a van with 743 pounds of marijuana in it. The statement said that the agents had shot the suspect knowing that he was unarmed and without knowledge of whether he was illegally in the United States or whether any crime had been committed. Later, according to the statement, they returned to the scene of the shooting, collected all of the shell casings, and failed to report the incident as required by the Border Patrol.

"," Owing to favorable conditions,   California produces almost three-quarters of the carrots sold in the   United States and contrary to popular belief, baby carrots do not come   out of the ground the way they appear when we buy them in bags at the   supermarket, according to a USA Today article dated August 11, 2004. After growing tired of discarding   imperfect carrots at his Bakersfield packaging plant,   Mike Yurosek came up with a solution of whittling down grown-up castoff   carrots into what we know today as “Baby Cut Carrots.”     Nearly 70% of carrots picked or close to 400 tons a day of undesirable   twisted, knobby, bent, or broken carrots called “culls” would be   discarded down the “cull chute”.   The nicer looking carrots   that remained were being packaged and sent to stores, says the article. By applying a little imagination, Yurosek   came up with the technique using an   industrial potato peeler that resembled a cement mixer along with a used   green-bean cutter to cut 2-inch baby   cut carrots from the unwanted carrot culls.  Thus creating the   standard size for America’s most popular “ready to eat” healthy snack. Baby cut carrots are   safe to eat right out of the bag.  According to the web site for Grimway   farms of California, one of the country’s leading producer of carrots,   baby cut carrots are washed in water with a small amount of chlorine   prior to packaging.  The chlorinated water solution for cleaning   food products is so miniscule that it presents no health risk.    According to the Food and Drug Administration website, the organization   that regulates the treatment of “ready to eat” cut vegetables, all   products must be rinsed in potable water prior to bagging and shipping. updated 9/22/08 ","Miscellaneous"

Here is the Dr. Ciancio’s letter: Dear Mr. Limbaugh, I was speaking to   an emergency room physician this morning. He told me that a woman in her   20’s came to the ER with her 8th pregnancy. She stated “my momma told me   that I am the breadwinner for the family.” He asked her to explain. She   said that she can make babies and babies get money for the family. The   scam goes like this: The grandma calls the Department of Children and   Family Services and states that the unemployed daughter is not capable   of caring for these children. DCFS agrees and states that the child or   children will need to go to foster care. The grandma then volunteers to   be the foster parent, and thus receives a check for $1500 per child per   month in Illinois.

"Budweiser is Ditching its Clydesdales – Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/budweiser-ditching-clydesdales/"," Budweiser will do away with its trademark ads that feature Clydesdale horses to appeal to a younger demographic. "," Budweiser says it doesn’t have any plans to put its legendary Clydesdale horses out to pasture. The eRumor started with an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on November 23, 2014, that said Budweiser would stable its Clydesdales in seasonal and Super Bowl ads in an effort to appeal to a younger demographic. According to the article: “After years of developing advertising and marketing that appeals to all ages, AB InBev plans to concentrate future Budweiser promotions exclusively on that age bracket. That means it won’t trot out the traditional Budweiser Clydesdales for this year’s holiday advertising. It means February’s Super Bowl ads will feature something more current than last year’s Fleetwood Mac. It means less baseball and more raves with DJ group Cash Cash.” Within days, however, Budweiser said the Budweiser Clydesdales aren’t going anywhere. According to Budweiser Vice President Brian Perkins: “There have never been any plans to remove our beloved Budweiser Clydesdales from our brand identity. In fact, we can confirm they will return to the Super Bowl in 2015. And they are stars of our new online holiday campaign that has been in production for months. “Let me be clear, straight from the horse’s mouth: The Budweiser Clydesdales are here to stay and will continue to play a central role in our campaigns, including holidays and Super Bowl. They represent the quality and heritage of the No.1 full-flavored lager in America.” The Wall Street Journal and other publications said that the Clydesdales would be replaced in ads with more trendy stars like zombies and hip-hop artist Jay-Z. However, Budweiser has featured Jay-Z and other artists in its ads before without doing away with the Clydesdales, so this appears to be business as usual for Budweiser. ","Miscellaneous"

"," The December 4, 2012 Fox Business report is real and both Fox and its parent company, the Wall Street Journal , released articles that said that the Automobile Club (AAA)  has urged “regulators and fuel producers to stop selling a new gasoline blend containing 15% ethanol, citing the potential for consumer confusion, voided warranties and vehicle damage.” The E15 gasoline is a mixture of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline, and was recently approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for distribution to drivers. According to the Fox Business report, some automotive makers said that they will not honor car warranties and cover fuel related repair claims as a result from consumers using E15 in their vehicles. The article said that the EPA has yet to respond to the Auto Club’s request but “has issued a statement saying it shares the association’s concerns over E15 awareness, but that the labels ‘will help ensure consumers are aware about which vehicles are approved for its use.’” E15 fuel is not yet being sold in all states.  It should be noted that E15 fuel not a mandatory item for customers to purchase and the current E10 fuel is still provided by stations carrying this product.

"Chairman of Progressive Insurance Peter Lewis Donated Millions to Left Wing Organizations-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aclu-lewis/"," Progressive Insurance Chairman Peter Lewis donates millions of dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org and other “leftist” causes. "," Claims in this eRumor are both true and outdated. The eRumor first surfaced in a forwarded email that was circulated in 2006. Peter Lewis is no longer the chairman of Progressive Insurance. He held the post until he died in 2013 at the age of 80. Lewis also served as the CEO of Progressive Insurance for 35 years before he stepped down in 2000. At the time of this death, Forbes estimates that Peter Lewis’s net worth was $1.3 billion. During his life, Lewis used his wealth to support progressive causes, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Moveon.org , as the eRumor claims. In 2003, the ACLU announced that Peter Lewis had donated $8 million to the group to “fight Bush Administration policies that trample on civil liberties.” The donation was split between the ACLU’s general fund ($2 million) and its endowment, the Trust for the Bill of Rights ($6 million). Lewis also donated $7 million to the ACLU’s general fund in 2001, so the claim that Lewis donated $15 million to ACLU from 2001 to 2003 is true. The claim that Peter Lewis and George Soros supported Moven.org is also true. The group was first launched to help persuade Congress to drop impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Later, it shifted its attention to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, in 2003, Peter Lewis and George Soros dedicated up to $5 million to help the group’s efforts to defeat President Bush, the Los Angeles Times reports . Peter Lewis was also a supporter of efforts to legalize marijuana for medical use. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimated in 2012 that Lewis had spent between $40 and $60 million funding the cause since the 1980s. Last updated 1/22/15 ","Miscellaneous"

World News Daily Report falsely reported that the remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC were found at the bottom of the Red Sea. The report was quickly shared nearly 200,000 times on Facebook.

But that name doesn’t appear in an online database of Cairo University scholars.

"Compressed Air Car Coming to Market – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/air-car/"," A zero-emission compressed air car that gets 185 miles per tank is about to hit the market. "," It’s true that a compressed air car has been in development for years, but there’s no timetable for its release. Tata Motors, the Indian automaker that has been developing the technology since 2007, told TruthorFiction.com that its “Air Car” was still in the project phase and that there was no timeframe for its launch. Mechanical engineer Guy Negre created the concept for the Air Car in 1991 for Motor Development International (MDI). In 2007, Tata Motors, India’s largest automaker, licensed the compressed air engine technology and set out to mass-produce it, the technology publication Gizmag reports . The world got its first glimpse of the Air Car in 2008. Popular Mechanics reported that Tata Motors and MDI had partnered to develop the first car that fueled by compressed air. The photos that accompany the eRumor were included in that Popular Mechanics report. “Of course, the Air Car will likely never hit American shores, especially considering its all-glue construction,” Popular Mechanics reported. “But that doesn’t mean the major automakers can write it off as a bizarre Indian experiment — MDI has signed deals to bring its design to 12 more countries, including Germany, Israel and South Africa.” Tata Motors said one version of the Air Car, “the MiniCat,” would retail for about $8,177. The MiniCat’s fuel range was expected to be about 186 miles, and a refill was expected to cost about $2. Speculation ramped up that mass production of the Air Car would begin in 2012, but that didn’t happen. Instead, Tata Motors and MDI said in a joint statement in 2012 that the companies had been working on the compressed air technology for five years and had recently moved on to the second phase of development. The second phase, which was to develop the technology and processes to “industrialize a market-ready project,” was expected to take a number of years. Posted  10/23/14 ","Miscellaneous"

Are aliens in UFO’s invading our planet and plucking cows from fields? "," This eRumor is unproven and could be a possible conspiracy theory. The TruthOrFiction.Com team is looking into this, and we will post findings on this page when they develop. Background We were able to find a website called CowAbduction.com that offered photos and information.  The website said, “Alien cow abduction is a serious problem. Countless bovines have disappeared from dairy farms everywhere.” CowAbduction.com also said that the number of incidents are increasing and its FAQ page said that the missing cow incidents seem to be concentrated in California. According to “ Investigations On Current Extraterrestrial Activity In Area 51 ” by Susan Wright, reports of bovine abductions by visitors from outer space is not new in United States.  In her book, Wright cites an account found in a textbook by the United States Air Force Academy on introductory space science and unidentified flying objects. On April 21, 1897, a well-to-do farmer, Alexander Hamilton of Le Roy, Kan., reported that his cattle were attacked two nights earlier by a 300 foot, cigar-shaped ship that hovered 30 feet above his livestock. The ship took one of his heifers. The next day Hamilton’s neighbor, Link Thomas, found the heifer’s hide, head and legs in his field. Hamilton’s account was even supported by 12 trustworthy citizens who swore to his character on a signed affidavit.

"The hardship of the signers of The Declaration Of Independence-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:58:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/patriots/"," This email goes through a list of some of the signers of the Declaration of Independence that led to the formation of the United States more than 200 years ago.  It says that the signers lived lives of hardship, personal loss, and poverty, and that five of them were captured by the British, tortured, and died.  The entire email is duplicated at the bottom of this page. "," This is a delicate one and could possibly be affected by which history book you read and how you interpret what is there.  The courageous patriots who signed the Declaration of Independence, as well as other of the fathers of our country, deserve all the recognition and honor we can give.  They risked everything to bring this country into being.  This email, however, makes it sound as though the British won, not the Colonists.  We don’t want to diminish the sacrifices each of them experienced.  There were hardships and losses, but to characterize the signers as not having enjoyed the fruits of their project of liberty is to overlook the quality of their abilities and the success of what they did. Here are some of our findings: First, none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence died in captivity.  All but two, or possibly three, died natural deaths and the majority of them lived to advanced age and had adequate possessions if not wealth.  Of the deaths, Thomas Lynch, Jr. was lost at sea on a recreational voyage, Button Gwinett died from injuries in a duel with a political rival, and George Wythe was thought to have been poisoned by a man who wanted his estate, but the man was acquitted.  At least four of the signers were captured by the British, but apparently because they were soldiers, not signers of the Declaration.  We consulted seven sources about the signers and none contained accounts of what could be called torture, at least not that was directed toward any of them for being founding fathers.  Two who were captured may have experienced some kind of torture because of the severity of their confinement, but that is conjecture.  All were released and died natural deaths, although the health of some was affected by their imprisonment.

"George Soros’ Evil Plan of Buying Up American Gun and Ammunitions Companies- Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:58:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cerberus-soros/"," Marlin Firearms is closing because a company owned by billionaire George Soros called the Freedom Group purchased Marlin Firearms with plans to shut it down. "," George Soros did not purchase Marlin   Firearms, and the company hasn’t announced any plans to shut down. The eRumor first surfaced in 2011 when a   chain email claimed that the Freedom Group, a company supposedly owned   by George Soros, had purchased Marlin Firearms and other gun and ammo   makers like Remington, DPMS, Dakota Arms and H&R with plans to shut them   all down. TruthorFiction.com first reported on this eRumor in 2011 and classified it as fiction. Over   the years, a number of variations of the eRumor have gone viral; so we   decided to take another look at a version that was in circulation in   early 2015: “For the last several years a company    called The Freedom Group has been buying up gun and    ammunition manufacturers.  Some of the companies are    Bushmaster, Marlin, Remington, DPMS, Dakota Arms and H&R.    Some people worry that this Freedom Group is going to control    most of the firearms companies in the United States. If you    control the manufacturers you can decide to stop selling to    civilians. What a perfect way to control guns.  Now if you do    some digging you will see that The Freedom Group is owned by    a company called Cerberus Capital Management. Guess    who controls Cerberus??? GEORGE SOROS, Obama’s chief financier!! He    wants to restrict or ban all civilian guns.” First, let’s take a look at the email’s   claims about the ownership of the Freedom Group and Cerberus Capital   Management. Cerberus Capital Management isn’t owned or controlled by   George Soros, as the email claims. Soros isn’t even listed as a director or board member of the hedge fund. Amid viral claims about Soros’   alleged role, the NRA even said in a 2012 statement that, “George Soros has never been a part of the Freedom   Group or Cerberus,” to calm its members’ fears. The man behind Cerberus Capital   Management and the Freedom Group is Stephen Feinberg, the chief   executive of Cerberus. The New York Times reports : “Mr. Feinberg, a Princeton graduate    who began his Wall Street career at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk    bond powerhouse of Michael R. Milken fame, got into private equity    in 1992. That year, he and William L. Richter founded    Cerberus, which takes its name from the three-headed dog in Greek    mythology that guards the gates of Hades. Today, Mr. Feinberg presides over a    private empire that rivals some of the mightiest public companies in    the land. Cerberus manages more than $20 billion in capital.    Together, the companies it owns generate annual revenue of about    $40 billion — more than either Amazon or Coca-Cola last year.” Cerberus Capital Management formed the   Freedom Group in 2006, and it has become “the world’s leading innovator,   designer, manufacturer and marketer of firearms, ammunition and related   products,” the company says . Since   then, the Freedom Group has rebranded itself as the Remington Outdoor   Co., so it’s commonly referred to by both names. The Freedom Group has acquired some of   the most recognizable names in the industry: Bushmaster in 2006,   Remington in 2007, DPMS Panther Arms in 2007 and Marlin Firearms in   2008. Cerberus also owned a number of gun and ammo makers before the   Freedom Group was formed. The company’s firearms business quickly earned   more than $1 billion in revenue a year, according to SEC   filings . Claims that Marlin Firearms had “closed   down” went viral in 2011 when the Marlin Firearms manufacturing plant in   Connecticut was shuttered after 141 years in business. A spokesperson   for Remington said the move was made to consolidate manufacturing operations to   cut costs in light of “intense” competition. Bushmaster’s plant in Maine   was also closed in an effort to consolidate manufacturing. But those   brands weren’t discontinued; their products were just rolled into other   manufacturing operations. Reports indicate that the gun and ammo   maker had fallen on hard times by the end of 2012. A Bushmaster gun was   allegedly used to carry out the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary   School in Newtown, Connecticut, and a group of parents later sued the gun maker over the shooting. Remington also faced a $25   million recall of   misfiring guns in 2014. All the while, gun sales had bottomed out.   Buyers flocked to the market in 2013 as stricter federal gun laws were   being debated, so demand for new guns was unusually low with those   buyers off the market a year later, the New York Post reports : “The situation ‘spells disaster’ for    Remington, said a source familiar with the company’s financials. Remington has seen its earnings    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fall from $240    million last year to $125 million this year, the source said.    Revenue has fallen from $1.25 billion last year to $1 billion in    2014. In October, Moody’s Investors Service    downgraded Remington’s debt to B2, or high credit risk. ‘Remington’s weakened financial    condition heightens ongoing rating concerns, including high    regulatory and product liability risks and the discretionary nature    of its products,’ Moody’s wrote.” Cerberus Capital Management has   reportedly been trying to sell the Freedom Group since late 2012. A   Florida company named Global Digital Solutions emerged with a $1 billion   cash offer to purchase the company in early 2014, but Freedom Group   officials later dismissed the bid. In December of 2014,   it was reported that the company had taken on more than $1 billion of debt. updated 02/17/15 ","Miscellaneous"

There is no “president” of the KKK.

"List of Facts and Figures about Illegal Immigration-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-aliens/"," The eRumor claims to have a list of alarming facts about Illegal immigration. "," Illegal immigration is a significant issue for Americans and deserves attention, but whoever authored this eRumor did not help his or her cause.  Most of the figures are either difficult to prove or don’t match known facts.  Some seem to be fabricated. A couple actually proved their point even better than the statistics quoted. Some versions say the figures are from the Los Angeles Times (which is not true).  Others say they are statistics from the FBI (which is not true either). One of the challenges with this topic is that illegal immigrants are somewhat invisible to statistics.  They are living underground and the best figures about illegal immigrants are mostly based on deductions from those who are either in professional positions working with immigrant issues or doing research on immigration.  None of the estimates should be considered the last word on illegal immigration and the figures we found sometimes varied widely. Here is our research on each of the points of the email: 1. 40% of all workers in L.A. County (L.A. County has 10.2 million people) Fiction! Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles issued a report in 2005 on what it called “L.A’s Off-The-Books labor force.”  Its research was about the city of Los Angeles, not the entire county, and concluded that there were 3,908,000 wage earners in the city and about 972,000 “informal workers,” meaning they were getting paid under the table.  It does not break down how many of them might have been illegal aliens, but the percentage was no where near 40 percent.  Los Angeles Almanac estimated number of “unreported jobs” in 2005 in Los Angeles County at 643,000 with a number of workers at 4,090.630. 2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens- Mostly Truth! The most commonly quoted source for this is a report by Heather McDonald and published by the Center for Immigration Studies.  She repeated her research on April 13, 2005 in testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on “Immigration, Border Security, and Claims” saying that 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide in Los Angeles targeted illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens- Unproven! We could not find anything to substantiate this.  If you browse through the Most Wanted list for the Los Angeles Police Department there are a lot of foreign-born listed, but not how many of them may be illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers- Inaccurate! According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, about half the births in Los Angeles County in 2004 were to undocumented women.  In 1989 California required by law that the state  Medi-Cal program be available to pregnant women living in poverty. 5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally- Fiction! National statistics would tend to suggest that this claim is not true.  A 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center said that among men 18-39, which represents the majority of prison inmates, the incarceration rate of foreign born was 0.7 percent while the incarceration rate of native born was 3.5 percent.   Foreign born Mexicans had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent in 2000 compared with 5.9 percent for native born men of Mexican descent.  The report did not say how many of the foreign born were illegal.  A 1993 report to the California Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations estimated that more than 15 percent of the 116,000 state prison inmates were illegal aliens.  In her congressional testimony (referenced above), Heather McDonald said that the L.A. County Sheriff reported in 2000 that 23% of inmates in county jails were deportable, according to the New York Times.  That’s all inmates, however, not just Mexicans. 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages- Unproven! It is known that large numbers of illegal immigrants are crammed into houses and apartments that are too small for the number of people living in them and that others are living in garages, but we could not find anyone who kept statistics on garage-dwellers or how anybody would know their numbers. 7.

Less than 2% of illegal aliens are picking our crops, but 29% are on welfare- Fiction! The U.S. department of Labor said that the number of farm workers who were undocumented in 1998-1998 was 52% . Regarding welfare, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for welfare except for elementary and high school education and emergency medical care.  Children born in the U.S. are citizens and qualify for certain public assistance. But what is generally thought of as welfare is available only to citizens or legal immigrants. 12. Over 70% of the United States annual population growth (and over 90% of California , Florida , and New York) is illegal aliens- Fiction!

Circret, a technology company based in Paris, unveiled a realistic promotional video that claims the product can “make your skin your new touchscreen.” In the video, light projects from the bracelet to create a touchscreen that looks just like an Android smart phone or tablet. More than 7 million users have viewed the video, many of them unaware that computer animation was used to bring the concept to life, tech website WTOP.com reports : The (video) doesn’t mention that the phone-arm interaction is a computer-generated mock-up. Not surprising, since a prototype Cicret Bracelet hasn’t been invented yet. “The video we put online is an illustration of what our Cicret Bracelet could allow users to do,” says Cicret co-founder Guillaume Pommier. Pommier says he and three partners are trying to raise money on their own, through PayPal instead of standard crowdfunding vehicles such as Kickstarter. “We need someone who’d put up some money to allow us to finish a prototype,” says Pommier. Cicret’s website says it needs to raise 300,000 Euros ($425,062) to develop a Cicret app, and 700,000 Euros ($993,177) to finish the first prototype. The website also warns readers about scammers possibly trying to cash in on confusion about the bracelet: “WARNING: We are still working on our prototype and didn’t launch any pre-order/order of the Cicret Bracelet. So don’t trust any website selling it yet.” In December of 2014, Prommier said the device would hit the retail market in about 18 months with a price of about $400, GizMag.com reports : The Bracelet comprises a pico projector and a row of eight proximity sensors that point towards the user’s forearm. It operates as a standalone device and, when activated with a twist of the wrist, projects an Android interface onto the users arm, much like Chris Harrison’s Skinput research. The proximity sensors detect where the user’s finger or fingers are and allow them to interact with the interface as they would any other Android device.

"," This eRumor gets a little complicated       but the main fear of those who circulate it is that Sprint has made       a political statement in the midst of controversy in the Middle       East. If Sprint really had decided to list all phone calls from places       like Jerusalem as having been placed from “The Palestinian       Authority,” it would have been a significant slap at the Israelis. According to its website, the International Telecommunications Union       is an organization that helps coordinate the complex world of       telecommunications.  In a move that was opposed by Israel, the       ITU decided in 1999 to grant a separate area code (970) to the areas       from parts of Jerusalem to the Jordan river on the east that are sometimes referred to as the       “Occupied West Bank.”  The Palestinian authority is       the entity that handles practical governmental affairs for the       Palestinians, so the area code is listed that way.  If you dial       into areas that are regarded as being under the umbrella of The       Palestinian Authority, your Sprint phone bill will reflect       that.  In the same way, if you dial into Israeli areas outside       of that, your Sprint bill will say that you called Israel. A Sprint representative told TruthOrFiction.com, that Sprint uses       the codes designated by the ITU and “…in no way expresses       political or any other statements through its provision of       service.” According to the folks at Sprint, there was another, temporary,       problem with the listing of locations in the Middle East. When the       new 970 area code came into being, there was a brief period when it       was accidentally listed on their website as the code for       “Palestine,” but was quickly changed.

"," This mailer is from officer Stephanie Mohr who is in prison and appealing a conviction that resulted from an incident with her police dog on 9/21/95. According to court records, an officer was doing surveillance in an area of Prince George’s County where burglaries had been taking place. When he spotted two men on top of a building, he radioed for help and someone, in turn, asked for a K-9 (dog) unit.  Officers Stephanie Mohr and Anthony Delozier, along with a Maryland State Police helicopter, all showed up at the scene. The two suspects were arrested and charged with burglary.  The charges were later dismissed against one of them.  The other pleaded guilty. In 2000, the suspect whose charges had been dismissed brought action against Mohr and her partner with violating the law by “acting under color of law to willfully deprive him of his right to be free from the use of unreasonable force.”  Both were also charged with conspiracy.  In the trial Officer Mohr said that one of the suspects did not raise his hands as ordered and did not follow her orders to stop when he came down from the roof.  She says that his body motions indicated to her that he was beginning to flee in a direction where there were no officers.  She says she told him to stop then released the dog to handle it.  The result was that the suspect was bitten by the dog.  Prosecution witnesses said they remembered it differently.  The officer who originally requested the assistance, Sgt. Dennis Bonn, among others, testified that the two suspects came from the roof peacefully, with their hands in the air, and did as they were told.  He says the dog was released on the suspects as they stood cooperatively with their hands up. The jury dropped the conspiracy charge against Mohr and the violation of rights charge against her partner but could not agree on the violation of rights charge against Mohr or the conspiracy charge against her partner.  A mistrial was declared.  The second trial convicted Mohr of the violation of rights charge and cleared her partner of the conspiracy charge.  She was sentenced to 120 months in prison. Officer Mohr says she’s been the target of zealous prosecutors who are looking for cases of civil rights violations against minorities and that some testimony against her has been stacked against her.  Critics of Mohr say she was part of a pattern of officers whose dogs had bitten cooperative suspects.

"Fifty Percent of American Marriages End in Divorce-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/divorce/"," Marriage has deteriorated so much that half the marriages in the United States are failing.  There is a 50 percent chance that your marriage will not make it. "," Here are some examples from just a few websites on the Internet: “Fifty percent of marriages will end in divorce.” — An infidelity support group “Fifty percent of all marriages now end in divorce.” — Promotion for a book on divorce “Fifty percent of all marriages in America end in divorce.” — From the treasurer’s office of a Midwestern state “Over 50 percent of marriages end in divorce.” — From a men’s counseling center in California Divorce is too common in America and that should not be taken lightly, but those who are committed to a lifetime of marriage don’t need the discouragement accompanying the notion that half the marriages are going to self-destruct anyway. I was once told by a young bride-to-be that she and her fiancé had decided not to say “Till death do us part” in their wedding vows because the odds of it really happening were only 50-50. Let me say it straightforwardly: Fifty percent of American marriages are not ending in divorce. It’s fiction. A myth. A tragically discouraging urban legend. If there’s no credible evidence that half of American marriages will end up in divorce court, where did that belief originate? Demographers say there was increased focus on divorce rates during the 1970s when the number of divorces rose, partly as a result of no-fault divorce. Divorces peaked in 1979 and articles started appearing that claimed 50 percent of American marriages were ending in divorce. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics told me that the rumor appears to have originated from a misreading of the facts. It was true, he said, if you looked at all the marriages and divorces within a single year, you’d find that there were twice as many marriages as divorces. In 1981, for example, there were 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces. At first glance, that would seem like a 50-percent divorce rate. Virtually none of those divorces were among the people who had married during that year, however, and the statistic failed to take into account the 54 million marriages that already existed, the majority of which would not see divorce. Another source for the 50-percent figure could be those who were trying to predict the future of divorce. Based on known divorce records, they projected that 50 percent of newly married young people would divorce. University of Chicago sociologist and researcher Linda Waite told USA Today that the 50-percent divorce stats were based more on assumptions than facts. So what is the divorce picture in America? Surprisingly, it’s not easy to get precise figures because some states don’t report divorces to the National Center for Health Statistics, including one of the largest: California. Some researchers have relied on surveys rather than government statistics. In his book Inside America in 1984, pollster Louis Harris said that only about 11 or 12 percent of people who had ever been married had ever been divorced. Researcher George Barna’s most recent survey of Americans in 2001 estimates that 34 percent of those who have ever been married have ever been divorced. One of the latest reports about divorce was released this year by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It is based on a 1995 federal study of nearly 11,000 women ages 15-44. It predicted that one-third of new marriages among younger people will end in divorce within 10 years and 43 percent within 15 years. That is not a death sentence, however; it’s a forecast. Martha Farnsworth Riche, former head of the Census Bureau, told USA Today, “This is what is going to happen unless we want to change it.” Most important, the statistics and predictions about Americans in general don’t tell the whole story about the future. There are other factors that affect a person’s chances for a long marriage. The NCHS study of women, for example, shows that age makes a difference. Women marrying before age 20 face a higher risk for divorce. Marriages that have already lasted for a number of years are less likely to end in divorce. If your parents did not divorce, your chances are better than if you came from a broken home. Couples who live together before marriage are more likely to divorce. The bottom line is that marriage is still what it’s always been: a commitment between two people who choose to remain faithful to each other. And they don’t need to feel doomed because of scary statistics — least of all ones that are urban myths.","Miscellaneous"

"," Cow tipping is the kind of topic that comes up when there isn’t much else to talk about.   When it does, there is frequently dispute between those who believe cow tipping is real and has happened, and those who say it’s nonsense. The folks at TruthOrFiction.com have been looking into cow tipping since the first time it was brought to our attention in the early 1980’s.  Although there is occasionally someone who swears to have participated in it or seen it, we have not found any credible evidence that it exists. Further, the cow experts we’ve checked with say that although it’s possible that somebody somewhere has toppled a cow, especially a young one, the logistics of cow tipping argue against it being a routine occurrence.  Adult cows weigh several hundred pounds and are built low to the ground.  They have a low center of gravity.  Pushing one of them over would take a lot of muscle power.  That’s if you could get near enough to pull it off. Rich Buhler, the founder of TruthOrFiction.com, is from cattle country in Arizona and says that even though cows have the reputation of being slow, they are actually very aware and very smart and and that it would be tough for someone to sneak up on one, especially at night.  He also says that cows do not sleep standing up. Sara Brantmeier, editor of America’s largest dairy industry magazine, told the Charleston Gazette in June, 2001, that cow tipping is a myth and the whole idea is stupid, but humorous.  TruthOrFiction.com contacted her and she confirmed that cows do not sleep while standing up and she’s never known of any authentic cow tipping.","Miscellaneous"
"Charles Darwin became a Christian on his deathbed and renounced evolution-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/darwin/"," Charles Darwin, the author of THE SPECIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION in 1859 and the champion of evolution, renounced his evolutionary theory and became a Christian on his deathbed.  This was reported by noblewoman Lady Hope who said she visited Darwin at his home in England at the close of his life.  She described him as reading the book of Hebrews in the New Testament of the Bible.  She also said that he regarded his writings about evolution to be questions that people made into a religion.  Lady Hope said Darwin asked her to conduct a meeting outside a summer house he owned so he could hear the singing of the hymns. "," The question of whether Charles Darwin accepted Christianity and rejected evolution is an emotional and intense one.  To many Christians, Darwin is a villain who articulated a godless creation.  To others, he is a brilliant hero who led the way to an enlightened view of where we came from.  There are researchers and authors who have worked hard to prove and disprove any notion that he converted to Christianity and TruthOrFiction.com’s conclusion is that when all is said and done, there is not enough good evidence that the story is true.  We stop short of declaring it fiction, but regard it as not sufficiently proven.  The report about Darwin’s change of heart comes from one person, Lady Hope, an energetic Nineteenth Century Christian, while many members of Darwin’s family denied it and there is nothing from Darwin’s friends, colleagues, his own statements or writings to substantiate it.  If Darwin did experience something so dramatic as a conversion to Jesus Christ and a complete revision of the theory of evolution that characterized his life and work, there isn’t a shred of evidence of it outside of the claims of Lady Hope. The book THE DARWIN LEGEND by James Moore is one of the most recent and cautious analyses about the Darwin conversion story.  For many years, detractors claimed that Lady Hope either didn’t exist or never visited Darwin.  Moore demonstrates that she did indeed exist and may very well have visited him.  He also concludes, however, that her account of what happened is not reliable. A response to Moore’s book is TRUE SCIENCE AGREES WITH THE BIBLE by Malcolm Bowden.  His attention to detail is valuable reading, but in trying to argue that the conversion story may be true, he has to do a lot of speculating about what Lady Hope, Darwin, or Darwin’s family might have been thinking.
