"Pray for Chad, a soldier shot in the head in Iraq-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/chad-snowden/"," This is a prayer request from a woman in Texas named Vicky Field.   She says her son, Chad was shot in the head in Iraq. "," Vicky’s son is named Chad Snowden. This prayer request first started circulating in November or December of 2004 and became widely circulated. According to a U.S. Army website, Chad was wounded by a sniper on November 13, 2004 while on patrol in Iraq. An article from May 5, 2005 in the Hood County News in Granbury, Texas, says that Chad is home and has recovered enough that he’s thinking about going to college. According to the article, the sniper’s bullet hit Snowden just above and behind his left eyebrow and exited the right side. From the time his mother first heard of his injuries it was only five days from the time that he was regarded as extremely critical until he could be moved from Iraq to Germany for treatment.  Then once in Germany, he was kept for only a day until being moved to Water Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. While there, he and his mother met President and Mrs. Bush as they visited wounded soldiers and their families at Walter Reed. Chad’s injuries were such that only a small part of his brain was damaged. In a short time, he was ready to be moved from Walter Reed to a military rehabilitation trauma brain injury hospital but, according to the article, that was delayed because of an  overload of paperwork required. Vicky shot into action and has since become employed by the Department of Defense project to help people like Chad who’ve gotten lost in the paperwork. She works with the newly formed Military Severely Injured Joint Operations Center and makes sure that veterans are connected to military benefits. Her first project was for a reservist from Texas named Eric Richardson.  He spent three months in the desert in Kuwait with boots that were a size too small and came away with a rare nerve condition that he says spread throughout his body including his brain. Now his memory is bad, his vision and hearing are affected, and he cannot walk. Vicky Field discovered that the roof in Richardson’s home is leaking and some of the ceiling has collapsed including in his 4-year-old child’s bedroom. She ran into a roofer at a gas station, told him about the Richardsons, and got the roof fixed. There is a toll-free hotline for the Military Severely Injured Joint Operations Center at 888-774-1361.

"Target says no to the Salvation Army and yes to sex toys?-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/target-sex-toys/"," The email says that Target stores are once again banning the Salvation Army red kettles from their stores and are also adding sex toys to their product line. "," This email is an alert from the American Family Association, a Christian watchdog group in Mississippi. Prior to the 2004 Christmas season, Target stores made the decision to no longer allow the Salvation Army to collect funds through the familiar red kettles and the bell-ringing Salvation army volunteers. That was viewed by many Christian groups as an anti-religious decision. The AFA release says that the ban on Salvation Army solicitors at Target stores is continuing into the 2005 season and, as an perhaps an additional affront to morality, Target is adding sex toys to its product line. The ban on the Salvation Army is true. Target said in 2004 that its decision was meant to accommodate the many requests it gets for solicitation and there was no indication that it was temporary. CLICK HERE for that story. During the 2005 holiday season a partnership was announced between Target stores and the Salvation Army to donate items to victims of the 2005 hurricanes in the U.S. as well as other needy families. The allegation that Target is going to carry sex toys has been denied by a Target spokesman, according to NBC news. The issue surrounds a product line from Trojan, the maker of condoms, called “Elexa.” WTOP radio in Washington D.C. quoted a spokesman from Trojan as saying that the Elexa line of products was going to be sold in Target stores. That part is true but Target says it will be carrying the condoms and other feminine products, not sex toys such as the Elexa vibrators. The eRumor also says that Wal-Mart is welcoming the Salvation Army solicitors, and that is true. Last updated 11/23/05 ","Appeals"
