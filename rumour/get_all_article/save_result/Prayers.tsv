"22 Christian Missionaries to be Executed by Afghani Islamists-Fiction!","2016-11-18 11:08:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/22-christian-missionaries-executed-afghani-islamists/"," A prayer request is circulating for 22 Christian missionary families who will be executed by Islamist Afghanis. "," This prayer request for 22 Christian missionary families in Afghanistan has been circulating since 2009, but there’s never been any indication that it’s credible. The prayer request began circulating via SMS text message and email in November 2009. The messages simply read, “Please pray for 22 Christian missionary families that will be executed today in Afghanistan. Please spread to others fast.” We couldn’t find any mention of the 22 missionary families, or their execution, in any news reports or releases from Christian or human rights non-profit groups to verify that the families were actually in danger. Today, the prayer request occasionally resurfaces on discussion forums and social media, but it’s outdated and there’s no indication that it was credible to begin with. ","Prayers"
"Prayer Request: Kayla Scott’s 22-Month-old Son Shot Self with Brad Nailer-Outdated!","2016-08-12 11:05:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/prayer-request-kayla-scotts-22-month-old-son-shot-self-with-brad-nailer/"," A prayer request is making the rounds on Facebook for the 22-month-old son of a woman named Kayla Scott who shot himself in the heart with a nail gun and is in critical condition. "," This prayer request has been circulating social media since 2010, so we’re classifying it as “outdated.” One of the earliest versions of the story appeared in a DIY chat room in August 2010. In that version, the poster said “a local 22-month-old boy” had picked up his dad’s electric brad gun and shot himself in the chest, just below the sternum. The post wasn’t a prayer request, but rather a reminder to unplug power tools when not in use: If you own an electric powered brad nailer, as I do, PLEASE remember to unplug it when you are not using it–even for a minute. A local 22 month old boy picked up his Dad’s, which was plugged in and turned ON and shot himself in the chest. The brad nail went just to the left of the Sternum, below the skin line and is into his heart. He is in critical condition at this time and the local Dr.’s here, which do heart surgery, are considering flying him to another hospital for surgery. Just one second in this child’s life is all that it took. Thanks for reading, David That story is impossible to fact-check since it doesn’t name the boy or the city that the accident supposedly happened in. Two months later, in October 2010, the story made its way to Facebook in the form of a payer request. In that version, the boy’s mother had a name, Kayla Scott: When the prayer request for Kayla Scott made its way to a prayer forum hosted by SingSnap that same month, questions began to surface about whether or not the story was true. Skeptics noted that the story had been in circulation for months, and nobody had actually heard from Scott or her injured son’s family. It should also be noted that different names have been associated with the story of the years, too. The boy’s mother has had numerous names — including Dedee Parsons, Teresa Lynch and Cheryl Dewitts — none of which have been confirmed. We also couldn’t find any news reports about a 22-month-old boy being shot in the chest with a brad nailer. There were reports of teens in Hawaii and Michigan being shot in the heart with nail guns (both survived), but those stories don’t match the particulars of the Kayla Scott Prayer request. In the end, we can’t definitively prove that the story of the 22-month-old boy who shot himself in the chest with a brad nailer is false. But the prayer request is definitely outdated. ","Prayers"
"Alabama Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant Carried a Prayer in His Wallet-Truth!","2015-10-26 13:30:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alabama-coach-paul-bear-bryant-carried-a-prayer-in-his-wallet/"," Legendary Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant carried an inspirational prayer around with him in his wallet. "," It’s true that an inspiration prayer was found in the wallet of legendary college football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant upon his death. The Paul W. Bryant Museum at the University of Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa has confirmed that Bryant carried a poem around in his wallet titled “A New Day” that reads: “This is the beginning of a new day. God has given me this day to use as I will. I can waste it or use it for good. What I do today is very important because I am exchanging a day of my life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, leaving something in its place I have traded for it. I want it to be gain, not loss — good, not evil. Success, not failure in order that I shall not forget the price I paid for it.” Bear Bryant used to carry the poem around in his wallet and was known to read it to his players. The museum, which hands out free copies of the poem to visitors, also has a video of Bryant’s former players reading the poem posted on its website. The poem was written by Heartsill Wilson, a motivational speakers and accountant from Texas. John “Hog” Hannah, a former player for Coach Bryant, explained the meaning of the poem and its author to Bryant in his book, “Offensive Conduct: My Life on the Line”: The author, Heartsill Wilson, was an accountant in Texas who also worked on the sales staff of Chrysler. Considered one of the finest sales consultants of that automotive industry, he was one of the most respected motivational speakers of his time. One of the greatest gifts Wilson had, which I now believe probably appealed most to Coach Bryant, was his ability to see the best in people and get them to see their own value and talents. His philosophy of leadership was often referred to as “peopleology,” a term loosely defined at he art of seeing things from someone elses’s perspective, and in the world of sales, his mantra was “to sell Jim Brown what Jim Brown buys and see Jim Brown’s needs through Jim Brown’s eyes.” I also personally think now that Coach Bryant carried that poem as a gut check or a reminder to balance his leadership style every now and then away from being a total dictator and a chronic, often punishing, masochistic football coach with exercising encouragement and positive praise of a player’s strengths rather than constantly harping on his weaknesses… So, rumors that Coach Bryant carried around a prayer in his wallet are true.

An Office Depot employee turned a woman from Rolling Meadows, Illinois, who wanted to print 500 copies of “A Prayer for Planned Parenthood.” The flier includes a prayer by the Rev. Frank Pavone, the national director of an anti-abortion group called Priests for Life, that reads: Lord for whom all things are possible, We are confronted once again today with the evil of the abortion industry and the corruption found in the world’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood. Lord, we pray for all who plan to be parents, and we ask your mercy on those who teach others to reject parenthood. In light of your Word, Lord, we affirm today that children are a blessing from you, and that the origin of all parenthood is likewise in You, the God of life and love. Therefore, Oh God, we stand against the evil that has been exposed in Planned Parenthood and in the entire abortion industry. We stand today for the triumph of truth over falsehood, of light over darkness, and of life over death. Bring an end to the killing of children in the womb, and bring an end to the sale of their body parts. Bring conversion to all who do this, and enlightenment to all who advocate it. Close the doors of the death camps in our midst, and open the doors of your mercy and healing! Close the grisly trade in baby body parts. And open the abundant gifts of your salvation and life! Hasten the day when our land will no longer be stained with innocent blood, and when the bodies of all your children will be raised from the dead and set free forever. We pray in the name of Jesus the Lord. Amen! The Office Depot employee declined to print it “on the fact that it contained certain words and phrases that could be construed as graphic or advocates the persecution of groups of people,” a company spokesperson said , but the company reversed that decision after further review. Office Depot CEO Roland Smith issued an apology a day later, and invited the woman back to the store, if she still needed copies made. ","Prayers"

"Presidential Prayer Team organizing prayer for the president-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/presidentialprayerteam/"," This report says that www.presidentialprayerteam.org is trying to get 2.8 million people to agree to pray regularly for the president. "," We’ve looked into this and it’s a legitimate effort with the endorsement of numerous Christian leaders including Dr. Paul Cedar of the Evangelical Free Churches of America. It was originally going to be launched in November, 2001, but the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in September, 2001 prompted the group to go ahead and start the ball rolling. The idea originated with Arizona sculptor William Hunter, who specializes in patriotic themes in his art.  He engraved and minted a special coin designed to be a reminder to pray for the President of the United States.  That led to the thought of mobilizing a large number of people in prayer.  The goal is to get 1% of the American population committed to regular prayer for the President, or about 2.8 million people. A spokesperson for PresidentialPrayerTeam.org said those who become a part of the effort will not end up on any commercial mailing lists. Also, those who do register their interest at the website will be kept up-to-date on prayer needs for the president. ","Prayers"

He has made amazing progress but still has some distance to go and hurdles to overcome toward full recovery.. Much of the world has been kept up-to-date on Ryan’s progress through several appearances by Pat Boone and other family members on CNN’s Larry King show. Ryan is 25 years old and on 6/19/01was sun-tanning with friends on the roof of the condo in Southern California where he lives. There is a skylight on the roof and nobody knows exactly how, because his friends were walking ahead of him, but Ryan accidentally fell through the skylight to a cement floor more than 3 stories below. He struck some stairway guardrails on the way down, which helped break his fall, but he hit the floor with such an impact that paramedics who arrived on the scene thought he was beyond hope. In the intensive care unit at UCLA Medical Center, there were other moments when hope seemed to be beyond reach, but Ryan has miraculously survived minute-by-minute from collapsed lungs, kidney failure, heart stoppage, having his spleen removed, and brain surgery. His skull was crushed in the fall but, amazingly, there were no other broken bones. ","Prayers"

"A church leader in China has been sentenced to death-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gong/"," Gong Shengliang, the leader of the South China church, a house church group, has been sentenced to death, and the penalty could be carried out on January 5th.  Fifteen other members of the church group were also given prison sentences.  Chinese authorities say the church is a cult and that Gong was guilty of rape and “undermining the law.” "," (2/20/02) According to reports from the underground church in China, Pastor Gong’s execution has been delayed and may be appealed. There is a chance his sentence could be reduced.  Human rights observers say the visibility of the case has helped turn it around.  Authorities in China apparently hoped to sentence and execute Rev. Gong without much public attention. Gong is regarded as an influential Christian leader in China.  The South China Church was started in 1991 as an offshoot of the All Ranges Church founded by the well-know Pastor Peter Xu.  The South China Church is said to have more than 50,000 members. According to Nina Shea, a human rights expert with Freedom House in Washington, D.C., Gong was arrested in August, 2001, and sentenced to death on December 5, 2001.  Four other leaders were also given death sentences, but they were commuted, possibly setting the stage for life sentences.  One of those originally given a death penalty was Gong’s niece, 37-year-old Li Ying. Shea says the Chinese authorities issued a “top secret” report in August outlining the charges against Gong and labeling the South China church “an evil cult.”  In the document, Gong was officially accused of using a cult to undermine the enforcement of law and of malicious assault and rape.  Local Chinese Christians say the rape charges are false and have been used by Chinese authorities in the past as a part of incriminating Chinese Christian leaders.  The report of charges claims that Gong and his followers “took revenge” on the people who reported their illegal activities through beatings and throwing sulfuric acid.  The report also claims that eleven women who were also arrested said that Gong had used his position of authority to rape them.  Freedom house says that two of the women have since repudiated the rape charges and claim they were beaten by Chinese authorities to make it appear as though they had been assault victims and that the rape accusations came after they were tortured with electricity while in custody. It’s part of a crackdown on the part of Chinese authorities on “unregistered” churches.   As has been the case in previous communist countries, China has an official registered church, but numerous religious groups have refused to come under the umbrella of the government-sanctioned church. In another case, a Hong Kong businessman named Li Guangqiang has  been released from custody after originally being sentenced to 2  years in prison for smuggling thousands of Bibles into China.   He was released as a good-will gesture in connection with a visit  to China by U.S. president George W. Bush. ","Prayers"
