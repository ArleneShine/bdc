"Paris At War Greeted by Media Silence-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-30 14:16:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/paris-at-war-media-silence/"," A YouTube video title “Paris at War” claims the media has blacked out reports about Paris being at war with migrant gangs. "," Videos of clashes between police and protesters in Paris are real — but those clashes were over a new labor law, and the protesters were not members of “migrant gangs.” Migrant protesters did clash with French police in October 2016, but that didn’t happen in Paris, and that’s not what is shown in this video. These rumors began circulating in a YouTube video titled “Paris at War” that shows raw video footage or police firing canisters of tear gas at unruly protests as words appearing on the screen falsely identify them as “Migrant gangs at war with police and locals.” The Paris at War video, which had been viewed nearly 1.2 million times, goes on to state that the media has been “silent so invasion of ‘refugees’ can continue,” as frightening images of burning cars and smoke filled streets flash behind. As it turns out, however, the Paris at War video actually shows members of the country’s General Confederation of Labor Coalition (CGT) and the Nuit Debout Movement clashing with police in June 2016 after tension flared during a citywide strike over a new labor law. Some of the same clips can be seen in this video posted by Ruptly TV in Paris. The law, known as El Khomri, was proposed by French President Francois Hollande to amend France’s 35-hour workweek, the Associated Press reports : The proposal technically maintains the 35-hour workweek, but allows companies to organize alternative working times without following industry-wide deals, up to a 48-hour workweek and 12 hours per day. In “exceptional circumstances,” employees could work up to 60 hours a week. To allow companies to deal with business booms, one measure would allow employees to work more than 35 hours without being paid overtime. In exchange, they would have more days off later on. Other measures would relax rules on layoffs and working from home and at night. The proposals have turned all major employee unions and youth organizations against the government. With next year’s presidential election looming and Hollande’s popularity having reached its nadir, legislation to make it easier for companies to end employment deals is fueling discontent in a country badly hit by the economic downturn. Citywide protests over the law unfolded throughout the spring, but by June protesters clashed police and riots erupted in June, which is when video footage from the rumor was filmed, the Guardian reports : Several hundred masked protesters have hurled objects at police in Paris, as the latest demonstration against disputed changes to France’s labour laws descended into violence. The clashes erupted on Tuesday as the international spotlight was turned on France as the host of the Euro 2016, which have also been marred by violence between rival football fans. Strikes closed the Eiffel Tower and disrupted transport links as tens of thousands of fans entered the country for Europe’s showcase football event. Authorities made six arrests and at least two people were hurt in the Paris unrest, as demonstrators stormed a building site and began to hurl wooden palettes at riot police. So, the video clip showed members of the labor party protesting a new law, not migrant gangs attacking police. But it’s especially misleading because protesters from France’s “massive” migrant camp in the northern port city of Calais did clash with police for a few hours ahead of the camp’s scheduled closure in October — even though the video doesn’t show those clashes. It’s easy to tell that the viral video doesn’t show migrants clashing with police because that happened in Calais, not the streets of Paris. Also, both clashes with police were widely reported by international media, so claims that there was a media blackout are false. Given all that, we’re calling this one “mostly fiction” ","Immigration"
"800 Immigrants Mistakenly Granted Citizenship-Truth!","2016-09-20 10:59:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/800-immigrants-mistakenly-granted-citizenshi/"," The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported that more than 800 immigrants were mistakenly granted citizenship because of incomplete records. "," Reports that more than 800 immigrants were mistakenly granted citizenship due to incomplete digital fingerprint records are true. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report on September 8. 2016, that found at least 858 individuals that had previously been ordered deported or removed from the country were mistakenly granted citizenship under a different name because their digital fingerprint records were not available: USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository, IDENT. Although USCIS procedures require checking applicants’ fingerprints against both IDENT and NGI, neither repository has all the old fingerprint records available. IDENT is missing records because when they were developing it, neither DHS nor the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), one of its predecessor agencies, digitized and uploaded all old fingerprint records into the repository. Later, ICE identified missing fingerprint records for about 315,000 aliens who had final deportation orders or who were criminals or fugitives, but it has not yet reviewed about 148,000 aliens’ files to try to retrieve and digitize the old fingerprint cards. The issues arose because of incomplete digital fingerprint recording practices dating as far back as 1994. That’s when Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) established a digital fingerprint repository to catalogue fingerprints collected by immigration enforcement officers who encountered aliens: In 2007, DHS established IDENT as the centralized, department-wide digital fingerprint repository. IDENT was built from a digital fingerprint repository www.oig.dhs.gov 3 OIG-16-130 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Department of Homeland Security originally deployed by INS in 1994 (used primarily by the Border Patrol).6 In 2008, according to officials we interviewed, ICE management directed its employees to send all fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement encounters to both IDENT and the FBI repository (at the time, the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System or IAFIS, now NGI). At the same time, USCIS also began gathering fingerprints digitally and storing them in IDENT; since that time, the fingerprints of individuals who apply for immigration benefits requiring fingerprints are stored in IDENT. Although fingerprints are now taken digitally and stored in IDENT, the repository is missing digitized fingerprint records of some aliens with final deportation orders, criminal convictions, or fugitive status whose fingerprints were taken on paper cards. The records are missing because when INS initially developed and deployed IDENT in 1994, it did not digitize and upload the fingerprint records it had collected on paper cards. Further, ICE investigators only began consistently uploading fingerprints taken from aliens during law enforcement encounters into the repository around 2010. ICE has led an effort to digitize old fingerprint records that Because of incomplete digital fingerprint records, at least 858 people who had previously been served deportation orders were mistakenly granted citizenship when they applied under a different name. The DHS OIG report concluded that few of these individuals had been investigated or denaturalized: Under the INA, a Federal court may revoke naturalization (denaturalize) through a civil or criminal proceeding if the citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.7 However, few of these individuals have been investigated and subsequently denaturalized. As it identified these 1,029 individuals, OPS referred the cases to ICE for investigation. As of March 2015, ICE had closed 90 investigations of these individuals and had 32 open investigations. The Offices of the United States Attorneys (USAO) accepted 2 cases for criminal prosecution, which could lead to denaturalization; the USAO declined 26 cases. ICE transferred two additional cases with fingerprint records linked to terrorism to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. ICE was scrutinizing another two cases for civil denaturalization. According to ICE, it previously did not pursue investigation and subsequent revocation of citizenship for most of these individuals because the USAO generally did not accept immigration benefit fraud cases for criminal prosecution. ICE staff told us they needed to focus their resources on investigating cases the USAO will prosecute. In late 2015, however, ICE officials told us they discussed with the Department of Justice Office of Immigration Litigation the need to prosecute these types of cases, and that office agreed to prosecute individuals with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) credentials, security clearances, positions of public trust, or criminal histories. To date, and with assistance from OPS and USCIS, ICE has identified and prioritized 120 individuals to refer to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution and denaturalization. The report concluded that ICE should review the remaining 148,000 aliens’ files that don’t have digital fingerprint records and update digitize and upload available finger print cards that it has on file.","Immigration"
"Muslims Are Taking Over Wilmar, Minnesota-Mostly Fiction!","2016-02-18 07:48:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslims-are-taking-over-wilmar-minnesota/"," A viral social media post makes a number of claims about Somali immigrants living in western Minnesota and argues that Muslims are taking over Wilmar. "," A number of claims made in this Facebook post are true, but they’ve been used to spin a false narrative about what’s been happening in Wilmar, MN. The Facebook post surfaced in December 2015, and it gained widespread attention in January 2016. The post said an unnamed couple who live in the small town that said, “Wilmar is soon going to be totally taken over by Muslims.” The post makes a number of claims to back that up. First, it claims that an elementary school in the town had been converted into a mosque. That’s true, but it’s also not the entire story. The Islamic Society of Wilmar purchased the former Lafayette Elementary School Building to establish mosque and school there. The school had been vacant for a number of years before that, and city council members approved conditional use permits for the mosque and school in April 2012. Seeing as though the school had been empty, the move was viewed as a positive one by city officials. The mayor did, however, say during a meeting approving the conditional use permit that he had received two emails opposing the permit, the West Central Tribune reports . Another claim made in the Facebook post is that an Islamic group had purchased a storefront in downtown Wilmar and displayed a map of Minnesota with the continent of Africa superimposed over the top. That’s partially true, but an editorial published in the West Central Tribune said the storefront is owned by a successful economic development agency and questioned why its artwork is relevant: A downtown storefront in the center of town with a map of Minnesota in the window that also features the shape of Africa does exist. Again, why is this so scandalous? Second, the true story is this logo is symbolic of the old and new homes of African immigrants of our city. This storefront in the center of town actually is home to a successful economic development agency based in Minneapolis, with a branch in Willmar. The business logo of this African Development Center is a drawing of Minnesota made to look like a jigsaw puzzle with one of the pieces in the shape of Africa. It’s symbolic of the immigrants’ old and new homes — Minnesota and Africa. The Facebook post also argues that children who have immigrated to Minnesota from Somali have struggled to assimilate into the school system. We weren’t able to find any evidence to back up that claim. This Facebook post makes a number of truthful claims about Wilmar, but those claims are used to spin a false narrative that Muslims are “taking over” the small town. ","Immigration"
"“I Smell a Rat” Column on Syrian Refugees by Eli Gordon-Fiction!","2016-01-19 12:10:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/i-smell-a-rat-column-on-syrian-refugees-by-eli-gordon/"," The “I Smell a Rat” column written by a so-called Canadian historian named Eli Gordon raises questions about immigrants fleeing the Syrian civil war in what it calls “sudden vast numbers.” "," There’s no trace of a Canadian historian named Eli Gordon outside of the “I Smell a Rat” column that began circulating in September 2015. The column first appeared on Facebook on September 12, 2015. A Facebook user named Marty Skinner posted the column with a note that said an unnamed “historian who offers an accurate assessment of the root of the problems the world faces today” wrote the column: About a month later, the column appeared at IslamReview.com. The site is designed to “demonstrate that the fundamental teachings of Islam are incompatible with the Christian faith, and the American way of life.” The column appeared under the headline “Muslim Guilt Trip Trojan Horse,” and Marty Skinner was identified as the author. A short time later, however, the column began appearing on discussion forums and blog sites with a so-called Canadian historian named “Eli Gordon” named as the author. We weren’t able to find any trace of a historian named Eli Gordon outside of this column, which usually means that the name was invented to conceal the author’s true identity. It’s not clear who exactly wrote the column, but a historian named Eli Gordon doesn’t appear to exist. The “I Smell a Rat” column argues that it’s odd for so many Syrian refugees to “suddenly” emerge at the same time after five years of civil war. The column begins: Syria has had a civil war for almost 5 YEARS. Why all the “refugees “NOW and why so all of a SUDDEN and why in such VAST NUMBERS? With an Honors degree in History and a lifelong student of the subject, I smell a rat.  This is a highly organized, well oiled, mobilized invasion of  Muslims and Jihadists into the Western World. It’s been in their plan for a long time. Momar Gadhafi predicted and explicitly stated that Muslim domination of Europe would happen without a conventional war and he said it 30 years ago. 95% of these economic “refugees” many who have cellphones are men between the fighting ages of 20 and 40. Very few women and children from everything I’ve seen. However, the idea that there was a “sudden” rush of Syrian refugees five years after civil war broke out is false. The United Nations has found that the pace of refugees fleeing Syria has remained fairly steadily since January 2012. By January 2014, 2.5 million Syrians had fled their homes since the conflict began in 2012. By January 2016, that number had grown to 4.6 million, which is a fairly consistent pace. The idea that there was a “sudden” rush of Syrian refugees in 2015 is false. Rather, as the refugee crisis continued to grow into a larger problem in 2015, which generated more attention from the U.S. and European countries. ","Immigration"
"Bill Still Report Updates Claim that UPS Smuggled Refugees on Plane-Fiction!","2015-12-29 11:08:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bill-still-report-updates-claim-that-ups-smuggled-refugees-on-plane/"," Author and filmmaker Bill Still has followed up on reports that a UPS cargo plane smuggled illegal immigrants into the country at an airport in Harrison, Pennsylvania. "," There’s still no proof that UPS has brought refugees into the country on converted cargo planes, and UPS directly told TruthorFiction.com that the claim isn’t true. We first reported on the story in November 2015 ( Click here for the report ). A man claimed that 30 charter buses pulled up outside a UPS parcel flight at Harrisburg International Airport and loaded passengers — Muslim immigrants, according to the narrator — and headed down a highway. The man told that tale while filming the back of a charter bus at night. We deemed the story to be false for a number of reasons. First, the video only shows the back of one bus on a darkened highway. There’s not proof that people — or illegal immigrants, for that matter — deplaned onto the buses from a UPS cargo plane. The videographer conveniently didn’t get video of the 30 buses being loaded up. Second, UPS called the claim “erroneous” and told us that UPS had not been involved in passenger flights of any kind into our out of Harrisburg. Despite a lack of evidence and UPS’s efforts to publicly address the rumor, it has persisted. Bill Still, a conservative author and filmmaker, picked up the story with a video published on his “Bill Still Report” YouTube channel that had gotten more than 222,000 views. In a bout a month In the report, Bill Still claims that “we may be getting closer to the bottom of the UPS charter plane that unloaded 30 busloads of people at night at the Harrisburg Regional Airport.” To make his case, Bill Still cites claims that were presumably submitted by his readers. We’ll take a look at each of them here: UPS has converted planes for passenger use- Outdated! It’s true that UPS dabbled in passenger flights temporarily in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the company had discontinued that practice in 2001. UPS converted a number of 727 cargo planes into passenger planes for weekend flights to vacation destinations like Mexico. The idea was to use company planes to generate revenue on weekends when they would have otherwise been parked on the tarmac, Philly.com reported in 2000: UPS started its passenger charter program in 1997, after company staffers and a consultant determined that money could be made by converting some older 727s, which usually fly packages just four nights a week, into passenger planes on weekends. The 727s were built for airlines in the 1970s as “QCs” or quick-change models, designed to be converted from cargo to passenger service and back, said Brad Eyster, UPS aircraft charter manager at its Louisville, Ky., airline headquarters. Despite early success of the UPS passenger program (it generated $20 million in revenue over its lifespan), a company rep told the aviation website Airliners.net that passenger service was discontinued in 2001 because it couldn’t be scaled to remain competitive with commercial airlines: “Our passenger service was discontinued in 2001; our competitors were seating close to 200 people per aircraft. For us to remain competitive, we would have had to invest long-term in the venture. Instead, we decided to discontinue the service and focus on our core business of parcel delivery.” So, it’s true that UPS temporarily dabbled in passenger flights in the late 90s and early 2000s, but that hardly proves that the company illegally sneaks immigrants into the country, as Bill Still’s commenter seems to suggest. A pilot said he was fired for refusing to sign a non-disclosure agreement to break FAA regulations- Unproven! Bill Still then cites a report from an unnamed commenter who said he “overheard” a pilot say that he was fired after refusing to sign a NDA that allowed him to break FAA regulation by flying refugees into JFK International Airport in the middle of the night, bypassing security. Unnamed sources that cited other unnamed sources that were “overheard” aren’t reliable. Besides, the idea that airport security punches out at night and can “bypassed” is false. FAA airport security regulations don’t have a 9-5 requirement; they must be followed at all times. UPS Actions Could Be Part of the Pennsylvania Refugee Resettlement Program- Unproven! Again, Bill Still cites an unnamed source who speculates that UPS has smuggled immigrants into the country as part of the Pennsylvania Refugee Resettlement Program. No evidence is given to support that claim, and we couldn’t find any, either. The stated purpose of the Pennsylvania Refugee Resettlement program is to provide “a continuum of employment, education, case management, health and financial support services to newly arrived refugees in the Commonwealth.” New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Has Backed up the Claim- Fiction! New Jersey Governor Chris Christie complained about federal resettlement of Syrian refugees in a November 2015 interview on FOX News — but he didn’t confirm reports that refugees had been illegally flown into the country at night. Chris Christie said the Obama administration had relocated 75 Syrian refugees in New Jersey over the last year “without even communicating with us.” In an interview on “The O’Reilly Factor,” Christie said: “The administration places them directly with non-governmental organizations, and they do not even give the administration of the state the courtesy (of notification)… We’ve had 75 Syrian refugees who have come into the state since January.” The State Department confirmed in a November 2015 report that 75 Syrian refugees had been resettled in New Jersey up to that point in 2015. And, communication between federal and state officials in New Jersey is unclear, but states are supposed to be at least consulted about refugee resettlement under the law. Stee Vladeck, a professor at American University Washington College of Law, wrote in a blog post that the Supreme Court has ruled that the federal solely oversees matters of immigration, but states should at least be “consulted” about incoming immigrants: In other words, states get consulted, and they get to make recommendations about where within their territory specific refugees should be resettled. That’s more than nothing, but it’s a lot less than a lot. There’s no veto; there’s no remedy if the federal government doesn’t actually “consult”; and there’s no requirement that the federal government actually implement whatever recommendations the state may make. To be sure, states can make life difficult for resettled refugees by, among other things, shutting down cooperative state/federal programs designed to aid resettlement, and they can make lots of political trouble for the federal government, but refusing to cooperate and complaining loudly is not remotely the same thing as having the legal authority actively to prevent resettlement. In conclusion, despite a Bill Still Report claim that “we are getting to the bottom” of claims that UPS cargo planes have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country — there’s still no proof that this has actually happened. Claims cited in the Still Report YouTube video checked out as outdated, unproven and fiction. That’s why we’re still calling this one “false.” ","Immigration"
"Muslims Were Banned from U.S. in 1952-Fiction!","2015-12-11 10:47:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslims-were-banned-from-u-s-in-1952/"," It’s been reported that Islam was banned from entering the U.S. in 1952 when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act. "," Muslims were not banned from the entering the U.S. in 1952. The purpose of the 1952 immigration law was to end the discrimination of immigrants based on “race and creed” — but it’s been widely accepted that the law went about that in a backwards way. That led to much of the law (including the provision in question) being repealed by Congress in 1990 . The 1952 immigration law became a hot topic after GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump released a statement calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” In response to backlash over the statement, Trump’s supporters pointed to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (which became Public Law 414) as “vindication” because the law supposedly banned Muslims from entering the country in 1952. Claims that Congress banned Muslims from entering the U.S. in 1952 can be traced back to Chapter 2 or Public Law 414 . As written, the law bans all aliens “who are members of or affiliated with” organizations that advocate for the overthrow of the U.S. government: (F) Aliens who advocate or teach or who are members of or affiliated with any organization that advocates or teaches (i) the overthrow by force, violence or other unconstitutional means of the Government of the Unites States or of all forms of law; or (ii) the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers (either of specific individuals or of any other organized government, because of his or their official character; or (iii) the unlawful damage, injury, or destruction of property; or (iv) sabotage. It’s true that the law would ban Islamic extremists from groups like ISIS, the Taliban and Al Qaeda who support the overthrow of the U.S. government from the country — but a small minority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims affiliate with extremist groups, according to data from the RAND Corp . That’s one reason we’re classifying claims that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as “false.” We’re calling the claim that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as “false” because it contradicts the original intent of the immigration law. With the bill, Congress ended the “blanket exclusion of immigrants based on race and creed” and established a (controversial) quota system for admitting immigrants from different and ideological grounds for excluding them based on personal history, according to the American Immigration Law Foundation . President Harry S. Truman believed the quota system didn’t go far enough in ending racial barriers, and he opposed ideological tests for immigrants as a violation of the Bill of Rights. He vetoed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Congress later overrode the veto) and wrote that the bill, “Presents a difficult problem of weighing the good against the bad, and arriving at a judgment on the whole.” Truman also wrote: I am asked to approve the reenactment of highly objectionable provisions now contained in the Internal Security Act of 1950–a measure passed over my veto shortly after the invasion of South Korea. Some of these provisions would empower the Attorney General to deport any alien who has engaged or has had a purpose to engage in activities “prejudicial to the public interest” or “subversive to the national security.” No standards or definitions are provided to guide discretion in the exercise of powers so sweeping. To punish undefined “activities” departs from traditional American insistence on established standards of guilt. To punish an undefined “purpose” is thought control. These provisions are worse than the infamous Alien Act of 1798, passed in a time of national fear and distrust of foreigners, which gave the President power to deport any alien deemed “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.” Alien residents were thoroughly frightened and citizens much disturbed by that threat to liberty. Such powers are inconsistent with our democratic ideals. Conferring powers like that upon the Attorney General is unfair to him as well as to our alien residents. Once fully informed of such vast discretionary powers vested in the Attorney General, Americans now would and should be just as alarmed as Americans were in 1798 over less drastic powers vested in the President. In conclusion, we’ve classified the claim that Muslims were banned from the U.S. in 1952 as false for two reasons. First, it assumes that all Muslims belong to or are affiliated with groups that want to overthrow the U.S. government, which is false. Second, that idea contradicts the purpose of the 1952 law to end discrimination of immigrants based on “race and creed.” ","Immigration"
"Jimmy Carter Banned Iranians from Entering the U.S.-Mostly Fiction!","2015-12-09 11:47:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jimmy-carter-banned-iranians-from-entering-the-u-s/"," President Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from entering the U.S. during the hostage crisis that played out at a U.S. embassy in Iran in the early ‘80s, according to reports. "," Jimmy Carter didn’t ban Iranians from entering the U.S. — but he did strip non-immigrant Iranians of visas and temporarily suspended new visas to Iranians. Jimmy Carter took those steps during the Iranian Hostage Crisis that spanned from 1979-81. However, immigration data shows that more Iranian immigrants were actually allowed into the country during those years due to political asylum laws — so the claim that Jimmy Carter banned Iranians from entering the U.S. is mostly false. Jimmy Carter’s action on Iranian immigration during the early 80s was drudged up after Donald Trump called for a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. during the 2016 presidential campaign. Critics compared Carter’s action to Trump’s proposals and argued that the media and liberals had treated Trump unfairly. Aside from the fact that Jimmy Carter didn’t actually “ban” Iranians from entering the country (more on that below), there’s one more big difference: Jimmy Carter’s action on Iranian immigrants was based on nationality, not religious beliefs. Trump’s proposal, on the other hand, targets those who practice a specific religion. Jimmy Carter declared a state of emergency after a mob of Islamic revolutionaries overtook a U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. Sixty Americans were held hostage there for 444 days in what would become known as the “ Iranian Hostage Crisis .” During that time, Carter declared a state of emergency, advanced economic sanctions against Iran and issued the executive order in question on November 27, 1979. The official text of Executive Order 12172 reads : DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO ENTRY OF CERTAIN ALIENS INTO THE UNITED STATES By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 USC 1185 and 3 USC 301, it is hereby ordered as follows: SECTION 1-101. Delegation of Authority. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are hereby designated and empowered to exercise in respect of Iranians holding nonimmigrant visas, the authority conferred upon the President by section 215(a) (1) of the Act of June 27, 1952 (8 USC 1185), to prescribe limitations and exceptions on the rules and regulations governing the entry of aliens into the United States. SEC. 1—102. Effective Date. This order is effective immediately. JIMMY CARTER The White House, November 26, 1979. The executive order effectively revoked the visas of non-immigrant Iranian visitors and suspended new visas to Iranian citizens. The measure, according to a Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans report , mostly impacted Iranian students studying in the U.S.: A number of Iranians were deported from the United States and those who were immigrants were required to report to their local Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) office for extensive interviews. During this period, 56,700 Iranian students reported to the INS and almost 7,000 were found to be in violation of their visas, of whom a number were deported, while most applied for political asylum, fearing that return to Iran would result in their persecution. The discrimination and difficulties that Iranians experienced throughout this time increased their motivation to blend into and comport themselves as productive members of United States. Immigration data does not support the claim that Jimmy Carter “banned” Iranians from coming to the U.S. in those years, however. Thanks to U.S. political asylum laws, there was actually an uptick in the number of Iranians admitted in to the U.S. in 1979 and 1980, according to State Department data: After the Iranian Hostage Crisis was resolved, the number of Iranians immigrating to the U.S. continued to rise. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out, many young men fled the country to avoid fighting in the conflict, according to the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans: Following the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980, an exodus of young men eligible for military service and middle class professionals ensued in Iran, and is reflected in the INS records depicting the relatively high number of men entering the United States. 22 Between 1981 and 1990, 116,172 Iranians immigrated to the United States. 23 Young men who were at risk of being drafted to fight in the Iran-Iraq War (1980 – 1988) became the beneficiaries of United States political asylum laws. 24 Between October 1981 and February 1985, more Iranians were granted asylum — 11,055 in total — than any other nationality. Thousands of other Iranians, however, remained in the United States illegally, working odd jobs, living with relatives and family, and making every effort to pass detection by INS agents and deportation back to Iran. So, Jimmy Carter revoked the visas of non-immigrant Iranians in the U.S. and temporarily suspended issuing new visas to Iranians. But immigration data shows that Carter didn’t “ban” Iranians from entering the country, as has been claimed. Donald Trump, meanwhile, has proposed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country.” That proposal targets individuals who practice a certain religion, not citizens of a government that the U.S. is in conflict with. Trump elaborated on his remarks in a written proposal: “Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.” In conclusion, we have classified this rumor as “mostly false” for two main reasons. First, Jimmy Carter didn’t actually ban Iranians from entering the U.S. Second, Jimmy Carter’s action targeted people based on nationality, and Trump’s targeted people based on religion, which makes the proposals very different.

"Anne Frank Was a Refugee Denied by the U.S.-Truth!","2015-11-25 08:11:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/anne-frank-was-a-refugee/"," Anne Frank, the little Jewish girl who penned “Anne Frank’s Diary” while hiding in an attic from Nazis, was a refugee and her family applied for U.S. visas but were denied. "," It’s true that Anne Frank became a refugee in the lead up to World War II and was denied entry into the United States. That revelation surfaced in 2007 when the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research discovered a file on Otto Frank, Anne Frank’s father. The file had been turned over to the Yivo Institute in 1974 by the National Refugee Service and was overlooked for more than 30 years. The documents show that Otto Frank applied for American visas and sought money and assistance coming to the country from a college friend, Nathan Straus, Jr., whose family owned Macy’s department store and who served as the head U.S. Housing Authority. Straus tried unsuccessfully to get Anne Frank and her family accepted into the U.S. before the family was forced into hiding in Holland, according to the Yivo Institute: In that letter, Otto Frank apologetically writes, “I would not ask if conditions here would not force me to do all I can in time to be able to avoid worse.” He goes on to stress that it was “for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance.” At the time of the letter, Jews in the Netherlands were facing increasing restrictions, having already been banned from owning radios and banned from the Civil Service, among other prohibitions; and an order had been issued requiring the registration of Jewish businesses. More directly urgent to Otto Frank was the fact that evidence (not included in the YIVO file) suggests he was being subjected to blackmail by a Dutch Nazi, and feared exposure and imprisonment as a racial and political opponent of the Nazi regime. Nathan Straus, Jr., and his wife, Helen, according to the file, made several appeals on the Franks’ behalf to the Migration Department of the National Refugee Service, and contacted the State Department for information and assistance. Another key player in the endeavors to get the Frank family out of the Netherlands was Edith’s brother Julius Hollander, who had immigrated to the U.S. in 1939 along with another brother, Walter, and whose employer, Jacob Hiatt of Worcester, Massachusetts, generously supplied an immigration affidavit for Anne and Margot. Julius and Walter had enough savings to help secure immigration for their mother, Rosa Hollander, who was living with the Franks in Amsterdam, but could not provide funds for the entire family. Unfortunately, their efforts were in vain, due to the vast numbers of refugees seeking safe haven, as well as drastic tightening of U.S. immigration policy – based partly on fears that some immigrants might be spies or saboteurs. After Anne Frank’s family was denied entry into the U.S., Otto Frank applied for a Cuban visa and the Strauses offered to pay a $2,500 deposit on it. The Cuban government initially granted the request, but it was withdrawn days later when Germany declared war on the U.S. The file indicates that Otto Frank first applied for a U.S. visa in 1938 but was put on a waiting list of more than 300,000 people and didn’t take further action until Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Shortly after that Anne Frank and her family went into hiding in an attic in Holland where she wrote of her experiences in what would become, “Anne Frank’s Diary.” The Nazis captured the Frank family, and Anne died of typhus at the age of 17 at Berggen-Belsen concentration camp. The idea that Anne Frank was a refugee gained prominence in November 2015 after terrorist attacks on Paris renewed debate about whether or not the U.S. should accept Syrian refugees. Anne Frank’s story has been used to argue in favor of the U.S. accepting refugees. ","Immigration"
"UPS Brings Refugees into the County on Cargo Flights-Fiction!","2015-11-19 12:46:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ups-brings-refugees-into-the-county-on-cargo/"," A viral video claims that UPS brought refugees into the country on a cargo flight that landed in Pennsylvania. "," Rumors that UPS snuck refugees into the country on a cargo flight that landed in Pennsylvania are false. That rumor started with a three-minute video posted on Facebook . The video begins by showing the back of a charter bus on a highway at night. A man following behind and narrating the video says that a number of charter buses lined up outside a UPS parcel flight at Harrisburg International Airport and loaded up passengers: “These buses, there about 30 of them, were lined up on the outside of a UPS flight out of Harrisburg International Airport. That is a parcel flight. Why are hundreds of people being snuck in on a UPS flight? This is no lie. We caught them red handed,” the narrator says. The video had more than 131,000 views 10 days after it was posted on November 9, 2015. After the terrorist attacks on Paris and public debate on admitting Syrian refugees into the U.S. that followed, the video quickly went viral. Other versions also popped up on YouTube claiming that busloads of refugees had been brought into Pennsylvania on a UPS cargo flight. A UPS spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that the rumor is “erroneous.” “UPS is a cargo airline and has not been involved in passenger flights of any kind into or out of Harrisburg. Suggestions to the contrary are based on misinformation,” Susan Rosenberg, UPS public relations director, told us. The video doesn’t provide any hard evidence or proof to contradict UPS’s claim, either. After all, it only shows is the back of a charter bus driving on a highway at night. The narrator claims that buses were parked beside a UPS cargo flight, but there’s no video (or proof) that that actually happened. The narrator also says there were “about 30” charter buses driving down the road, but only one or two buses are visible in the video. Also, the numbers don’t seem to check out: there couldn’t be enough people on one cargo flight to fill up 30 charter buses. Also, the way that UPS uses Harrisburg International Airport in the normal course of business doesn’t jive with the video’s claims. We confirmed that UPS does in fact use Harrisburg International Airport on a regular basis — but we quickly learned that international flights rarely (if ever) fly directly into Harrisburg International Airport from outside the country. UPS moves about 22,800 tons of cargo through the airport each year. Because there are many warehouses and manufacturers in the region, the vast majority of cargo is outbound rather than inbound. Most often, UPS flies cargo into Harrisburg from airports in Williamsport and Scranton. Then, it’s combined with cargo brought in on trucks, and UPS flights depart from Harrisburg to Worldport , the company’s main air hub, in Louisville, according to Harrisburg International Airport . So, in the normal course of business, international UPS flights don’t fly directly into Harrisburg International Airport from outside the country. But that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen, or hasn’t happened. We’re classifying claims that UPS brought refugees into the country on a cargo plane as fiction. First, the company has directly denied that claim. Second, the viral video shows no proof, other than the back of a nondescript charter bus. Third, it appears that the vast majority of UPS flights fly into Harrisburg from other parts of Pennsylvania (not outside the country), and then depart for Louisville. ","Immigration"
"First 10,000 Syrian Refugees Arrive in New Orleans-Fiction!","2015-11-17 08:14:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/first-10000-syrian-refugees-arrive-in-new-orleans/"," In the wake of deadly terrorist attacks on Paris, blog sites have reported that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in New Orleans. "," Reports that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in New Orleans are false. That rumor started with The Hayride, a right wing blog site, on November 2, 2015. The website reported that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had been resettled in Louisiana, specifically in Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Metairie and New Orleans: The 10,000 Syrian refugees are first flown to the United States, according to the French news wire Agence France-Presse, with the State Department paying the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the airfare. Then, once the refugees arrive in the country, they could be dispersed across the 180 cities listed above, where they are to aided within the first 30 to 90 days in settling and finding employment in the area. After approximately 90 days, refugees are no longer eligible for the State Department-funded support that they were receiving through migrant and refugee services. However, they are able to join support programs through the Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, it is unclear how much the screening process for the 10,000 Syrian refugees will cost American taxpayers. To back up the claim that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had arrived in Louisiana, The Hayride linked to a Yahoo News story headlined, “How the US plans to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees.” But the story didn’t confirm that 10,000 Syrian refugees had arrived in Louisiana — it talked about how 10,000 refugees that President Obama plans to resettle in the country over the next 12 months would be vetted and located: Once the US State Department receives their case files it employs NGO contractors to pre-screen them for eligibility for refugee status, then they are subjected to health and security checks. Officers from the Department of Homeland Security fly from Washington to the camps and conduct interviews with candidates, seeking to weed out what a US official called “liars, criminals and terrorists.” Each case file is reviewed by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI’s terrorist screening center, the DHS, the Department of Defense and “other agencies” — US intelligence. “Refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States,” another State Department official told reporters. After the deadly terrorist attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, The Hayride’s false report that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees had been resettled in New Orleans spread across various right wing blog sites and officially went viral. President Obama announced in September 2015 that the he would push for the U.S. to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees total — not just in New Orleans or Louisiana — in fiscal year 2016. As for New Orleans, The Times-Picayune reports that a total of 14 Syrian refugees had been settled in Louisiana so far in 2015 — not 10,000. So, reports that the first 10,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in New Orleans are false. ","Immigration"
"Denmark Has Banned Muslims from the Country-Mostly Fiction!","2015-10-21 10:51:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/denmark-has-banned-muslims-from-the-country/"," Denmark has banned Muslim refugees and immigrants from settling in the country. "," Denmark has not banned Muslims, but the country has tightened immigration laws and has made the religious slaughter of animals for Halal and Kosher meat illegal. Immigration has been a hot issue in Denmark for years. Back in 2011, the country tightened immigration laws by implementing a “points system.” The goal was to make it more difficult for immigrants to gain citizenship through marriage, the BBC reports : There are new stricter requirements for would-be immigrants, and for those already in Denmark, who wish to marry a Dane. This is in addition to the already high minimum age of 24 for both the Danish and the foreign would-be spouse, proof of financial independence and an “active commitment to Danish society.” Then, the right wing, anti-immigration Danish People’s Party became the second largest party in Danish parliament after elections in June 2015. Party leaders said their top priorities were to cut the number of asylum seekers the country accepts, reintroducing border controls, reforming border controls and preventing migrants from claiming benefits, the Guardian reports . Within three months of the election, the country had cut benefits for asylum seekers in half, implementing a one-year waiting period for refugees before they can bring their families to the country and establishing a five-year wait for a permanent residence permit. Then, the Danish government took out advertisements in Middle Eastern newspapers that detailed the new restrictions in an effort to deter migrants, Deutsche Welle reports . Also, in 2014, Denmark banned the religious slaughter of animals for Kosher and Halal meat. European regulations require that animals are stunned before they are slaughtered but grants exceptions on religious grounds. Kosher and halal animals must be conscious while slaughtered, the Independent reports : The change to the law, announced last week and effective as of yesterday, has been called “anti-Semitism” by Jewish leaders and “a clear interference in religious freedom” by the non-profit group Danish Halal. European regulations require animals to be stunned before they are slaughtered, but grants exemptions on religious grounds. For meat to be considered kosher under Jewish law or halal under Islamic law, the animal must be conscious when killed. Yet defending his government’s decision to remove this exemption, the minister for agriculture and food Dan Jørgensen told Denmark’s TV2 that “animal rights come before religion” So, reports that Denmark has outright banned Muslims from the country are mostly fiction. But Danish officials have made it much for difficult for all immigrants — including those from Islamic countries — to go there. They have also made the religious slaughter of meat illegal, which makes it more difficult for Muslims and Jews to practice their religions there. ","Immigration"
"Female Physician in Munich Pens Email About Refugee Crisis-Unproven!","2015-10-19 09:10:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/female-physician-in-munich-pens-email-about-refugee-crisis/"," A female physician from Munich described in an email the challenge of providing medical care to refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries who have come to Germany. "," We can’t confirm the authenticity of an email that was supposedly written by a female physician in Munich because the name of the author hasn’t been disclosed. The email supposedly written by a female physician from Munich went viral after a Czech newscaster read it on the air during a broadcast that has gone viral. In the email, the female doctor from Munich describes unsafe conditions for physicians and nurses in German hospitals because of demanding, angry and volatile refugees from Syria and other countries seeking care there: In a hospital near the Rhine, migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death, which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days, despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished. The local press is forbidden to write about it, so we know about it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his own syphilis-infected urine into a nurse’s face and so threatened her with infection? At a minimum he’d go straight to jail and later to court. With these people – so far, nothing has happened. There haven’t been any local press reports about attacks on doctors or hospital staffs by refugees — but, then again, the email claims that local media has been “forbidden” to write about it. But that claim doesn’t check out. Some German media outlets have openly criticized Chancellor Merkel for supposedly contributing to the large inflow of refugees, so reports of a media blackout don’t check out, according to a Deutsche Wells press review . Also, the idea that refugees are flooding hospitals and demanding medical care don’t mesh with German laws on providing healthcare for refugees. Asylum seekers in the country are granted limited access to medical care, EurActive Germany reports : In most of the German Länder, asylum seekers are not allowed to go directly to doctors when they are in pain or call an ambulance after an accident. Instead, they are required to get a permit first from the appropriate authorities or the refugee centre. This procedure is regulated by the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act of 1993. The goal of the law is to keep health-related spending low and limit incentives for asylum seekers in Germany. Those who seek asylum in Germany are only given full coverage under statutory health insurance after spending 15 months in the county. Before that they can only receive acute care and have to receive special permission to visit hospitals. UPDATE : A reader brought a newer version of this email to our attention. In that version, Dr. Barbara Sziraki is named as the German physician who wrote the viral email. After investigating, we’ve determined that Dr. Barbara Sziraki a psychiatrist who practices in Los Angeles . Her name and email appears to have been mistakenly attached to the email after she sent or received it. ","Immigration"
"10,000 Passports Seized in Bulgaria Were Bound for Islamic Terrorists-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-10-12 13:58:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/10000-passports-seized-in-bulgaria-were-bound-for-islamic-terrorists/"," Officials in Bulgaria seized a box of 10,000 fake Syrian passports that were going to be given to Islamic terrorists to gain entry into Europe. "," It’s true that 10,000 fake Syrian passports were seized in Bulgaria, but there’s no indication that the passports were going to be given to Islamic terrorists. The rumor that 10,000 fake Syrian passports had been seized in Bulgaria started with a report that appeared in the German newspaper Der Tagesspigel about the refugee crisis fueling a black market for stolen or forged Syrian passports: Fake or real Syrian passports have become a coveted commodity on the black market in Germany and other countries. In Bulgaria, the police recently (seized) 10,000 false Syrian passports. The documents will be sold for a lot of money to prospective customers because they are important for a successful application for asylum in the West. Many of the approximately two million Syrians who arrived in recent years in Turkey, have no valid identity papers more. Some lost their passports during the escape, others never had papers: The Kurds in Syria, for example, were not considered as citizens, but as stateless persons of Damascus long. In other cases, the passes are long expired – in young Syrian men who have not yet performed their military service, the pass is valid for only two years. Few refugees venture out into the Syrian embassy or consulate in Turkey or elsewhere, to apply for an extension. For a long time it was not a big problem. But since Germany and other countries to the Syrian refugees promise almost automatic recognition of their asylum application, Syrian passports for the refugees have suddenly become very important and worth a lot of money. Many of the refugees who fled Syria because of the civil war don’t have passports. Either they were never issued a passport, they didn’t take their passport with them when they fled, or their passport has expired. Because Germany and other countries require Syrian migrants to show proof of identification and citizenship before they’re accepted, so there’s been a huge surge in demand for fake Syrian passports. And, in many cases, even actual political refugees from Syria need to buy Syrian fake passports — so the claim that all of those passports were going to Islamic terrorists is false. Also, migrants from other Middle Eastern and African countries are posing as Syrians to gain asylum in Germany and other European countries need to purchase fake or stolen passports, according to the report: Not only Syrians are interested in Syrian passports. Even as refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan will (pose as) Syrians to secure in this way a recognition as asylum seekers in Western Europe. So, it’s true that there’s a huge black market for fake Syrian passports, and that Bulgarian officials seized 10,000 fake passports. It’s not true, however, that those 10,000 passports were going to be given to Islamic terrorists. That rumor started after a story appeared at the New Observer website that reported Bulgarian officials had seized 10,000 fake Syrian passports. Then, Walid Shoebat linked to the story on his blog site and (falsely) reported that, “Bulgarian police discover boxes owned by Muslim refugees going to Germany, and in them they find 10,000 fake passports that Were going to be given to Islamic terrorist.” However, German reports don’t indicate that the passports were being smuggled by Muslim refugees — they were actually being smuggled by people looking to exploit the refugees. And there’s no indication that the Syrian passports were going to be given to an Islamic terrorist since so many actual political refugees from Syria need fake or forged passports to gain asylum in Germany.

"," These photos don’t show a tramp steamer ship bound from Libya to Italy. The photos actually date back to 1991. They show what’s become known as the “Albania Vlora incident” when a mass exodus of Albanian migrants washed ashore in Italy. Italian officials aboard boats tried to head off ships packed with immigrants from Albania, one with as many as 10,000 people. The Vlora, a type of ship known as a steam tramp, ran past the Italian blockade and hundreds of men dove into the water and swam ashore, the New York Times reported in August 1991: Most of the Albanians were taken to a local soccer stadium, where they tried to break free Thursday night while being kept under police guard. Nervous security forces said they had opened fire after some of the Albanians threw rocks at them. Early reports said two or three Albanians had been taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds. The circumstances of the shootings were not clear early today. The authorities in Bari claimed that at least two of the wounded had been shot by other Albanians inside the stadium before the broader disturbance began. Help of Army Is Asked Saying that nearly a dozen of their own officers were hurt, some with head injuries, the police reinforced their patrols at the stadium and asked for help from the army. The Albanians arrived on a rusty freighter called the Vlora, young men for the most part who said they were looking for work and who filled every inch of available space from deck to mast. Italian officials said many of the Albanian migrants were denied because they had been seeking economic advancement, not political refuge. The Migration Policy Institute reports that about 1 million Albanians fled the country during the 1990s because of its poor economic and living conditions: By the present day, approximately 25 percent of the total population, or over 35 percent of the labor force, has emigrated. The country has approximately 900,000 emigrants, now residing mainly in Greece (600,000), Italy (200,000), and most of the remainder in other Western European countries, the U.S., and Canada. Albania’s migration flow has, since the early 1990s, been five times higher than the average migration flow in developing countries. Photos of the Albania Vlora incident went viral in forwarded emails in October 2015 as Europe’s struggle to deal with hundreds of thousands of migrants from Syria fueled debate over immigration policies. A caption included with the photos claimed that the tramp steamer packed full of migrants was headed from Libya to Italy: One of the tramp steamers leaving for Italy from Libya……. And everyone is taken in by the loving Europeans……………. Those kind loving socialists that are soon going to be overrun. But we know that the photos actually show Albanian immigrants headed to Italy during the 1990s, so that claim is false. ","Immigration"

"," A fake news website is behind the false report that Menominee, Michigan, will accept 4,500 Syrian refugees. The fake new website National Report published the story as world powers struggled to accommodate tens of thousands of Syrian refugees that were pushed from their homes by the Syrian civil war: FBI counter-terrorism expert Michael Steinbach told Congress recently it has no reliable way of vetting the Syrian refugees and FBI Director James Comey has said its hands are full with active ISIS investigations in all 50 states. Regardless of FBI findings, cities chosen for immediate refugee relocation include: Bowling Green, Kentucky, New Bern, North Carolina, and Menominee, Michigan. The smallest city on the list, Menominee, MI, with a population of just over 8,500 residents, will feel the greatest impact.

In a translated version of the blog , Kamil Bulonis writes: This huge mass of people — I’m sorry I’ll write — but it’s an absolute wilderness … Vulgar, throwing bottles, loud shouts of “We want Germany” — and Germany is now a paradise.

A police spokesperson said it was a “frivolous joke” and that there had been no reports of refugee attacks in the area.

"Claims About the Federal Government’s “Operation Wetback”-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-08-31 12:54:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-about-the-federal-governments-operation-wetback/"," A chain email claims that a federal effort to deport illegal aliens in the 1950s called “Operation Wetback” led to the removal of 13 million illegal aliens. "," Operation Wetback was a real government program, but it didn’t deport 13 million illegals. The “Operation Wetback” email has been around for years. The email resurfaced when immigration reform became a heated issue in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. That led many to wonder if claims made in the email about Operation Wetback, and the number of deportations from 1953-1954, are true: in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower deported 13 million Mexican Nationals! The program was called ‘Operation Wetback’.. It was done so WWII and Korean Veterans would have a better chance at jobs. It took 2 Years, but they deported them! Now. … if they could deport the illegal’s back then — they could sure do it today Again, Operation Wetback was a real government program, but it didn’t lead to 13 million deportations, as the email claims. Operation Wetback was launched in response to the Bracero Program, which allowed millions of Mexican men work in the U.S. on short-term labor contracts. About 4.6 million labor contracts were awarded through the program, which operated from 1942-1964, the Barcero History Archive reports : The Bracero Program was created by executive order in 1942 because many growers argued that World War II would bring labor shortages to low-paying agricultural jobs. On August 4, 1942 the United States concluded a temporary intergovernmental agreement for the use of Mexican agricultural labor on United States farms (officially referred to as the Mexican Farm Labor Program), and the influx of legal temporary Mexican workers began. But the program lasted much longer than anticipated. In 1951, after nearly a decade in existence, concerns about production and the U.S. entry into the Korean conflict led Congress to formalize the Bracero Program with Public Law 78. Mexico demanded that Texas be excluded from the Bracero Program because of “widespread violations of contracts, discrimination against migrant workers, and such violations of their civil rights.” That led to “freelance coyotes” illegally bringing migrant workers into Texas for unregulated farm work and an increase in the number of illegal aliens in the state, and elsewhere in the southwest, the Texas State Historical Commission reports : Increasing grievances from various Mexican officials in the United States and Mexico prompted the Mexican government to rescind the bracero agreement and cease the export of Mexican workers. The United States Immigration Service, under pressure from various agricultural groups, retaliated against Mexico in 1951 by allowing thousands of illegals to cross the border, arresting them, and turning them over to the Texas Employment Commission, which delivered them to work for various grower groups in Texas and elsewhere. Over the long term, this action by the federal government, in violation of immigration laws and the agreement with Mexico, caused new problems for Texas. Between 1944 and 1954, “the decade of the wetback.” the number of illegal aliens coming from Mexico increased by 6,000 percent. The boom of illegal aliens coming to the U.S. led to the launch of Operation Wetback in May 1953. The program marked “the beginning of modern deportation raids and the militarization of the border.” Operation Wetback continued through the fall of 1954, Oklahoma State University’s History Department reports : For years before Operation Wetback, agribusiness used its economic prowess to control the U.S. Border Patrol’s enforcement of federal immigration law. On some occasions, Border Patrol and INS officials would simply look the other way when they encountered undocumented immigrants or, in some cases, legalize them on the spot to avoid disrupting an employer’s’ workforce, especially during peak harvest seasons. Operation Wetback was supposed to mark a shift in these power dynamics by diminishing agribusiness’s control and asserting federal authority. The tension between employers looking for cheap labor and the federal government enforcing immigration laws remains today. The email’s claim that 13 million illegal aliens were deported under Operation Wetback is false. Initially, the INS said that 1.3 million illegal aliens had been apprehended under the program, but even that figure was later proven false, according to OSU: It is difficult to estimate the number of illegal aliens forced to leave by the operation. The INS claimed as many as 1,300,000, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. The INS estimate rested on the claim that most aliens, fearing apprehension by the government, had voluntarily repatriated themselves before and during the operation. The San Antonio district, which included all of Texas outside of El Paso and the Trans-Pecos, had officially apprehended slightly more than 80,000 aliens, and local INS officials claimed that an additional 500,000 to 700,000 had fled to Mexico before the campaign began. Many commentators have considered these figures to be exaggerated. Stats on the number of historical deportations also contradict the claim that 13 million illegal aliens were deported under Operation Wetback. From 1951-1960, there were a total of 150,472 “formal removals” and about 3.9 million “voluntary departures” of illegal aliens, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . ","Immigration"

"," Tina Griego didn’t write the “Mexican Visitor’s Lament” column. The Mexican Visitor’s Lament column first appeared online in 2007. The column attempts to explain what would happen if 20 million illegal aliens immediately vacated America: That’s a good question. . . it deserves an answer. Over 80 percent of Americans demand secured borders and illegal migration stopped. But what would happen if all 20 million or more vacated America? The answers may surprise you! In California, if 3.5 million illegal aliens moved back to Mexico it would leave an extra 10.2 billion to spend on overloaded school systems, bankrupt hospitals and overrun prisons. It would leave highways cleaner, safer and less congested. Everyone could understand one another as English became the dominant language again. In Colorado, 500,000 illegal migrants, plus their 300,000 kids and grand-kids . . . would move back home, mostly to Mexico. That would save Coloradans an estimated 2 billion (other experts say 7 billion) annually in taxes that pay for schooling, medical, social-services and incarceration costs. It means 12,000 gang members would vanish out of Denver alone. Colorado would save more than 20 million in prison costs, and the terror those 7,300 alien criminals set upon local citizens. Denver Officer Don Young and hundreds of Colorado victims would not have suffered death, accidents, rapes and other crimes by illegals. Denver Public Schools would not suffer a 67 percent drop-out/flunk out rate because of thousands of illegal alien students speaking 41 different languages. At least 200,000 vehicles would vanish from out gridlocked cities in Colorado. Denver’s four percent unemployment rate would vanish as our working poor would gain jobs at a living wage. The confusion continues years after the fake column appeared because Tina Griego actually did write a column that looked at the impact of 20 million illegal aliens leaving the U.S. in 2007. Griego explained the situation in yet another column that appeared in the Denver Post : So, here’s a funny thing. A few years ago, a local man wrote an Internet column. You can find his name on your own if you’re so inclined. He called it, “What if 20 Million Illegal Aliens Vacated America.” He referenced a column I wrote about a conversation with a visiting Mexican journalist. She asked what would happen if 20 million illegal immigrants returned to Mexico. She was talking about their economic contribution here, the taxes paid, the purchases of goods and services. This question provoked our local man, prompting him to pen the aforementioned cyber-column. The parody column claimed that the mass exodus of 20 million illegal aliens would lead to drops in crime rates, prison bookings, gang activity, infectious diseases and even greenhouse gas emissions. Tina Griego responded to a number of those claims in her follow-up column : Last year, the Denver city/county jail saw 46,884 “book-ins.” A person can be booked-in more than once. I’d like to provide you with an unduplicated head count, but the city doesn’t keep track that way. Dulacki can say that by year’s end, 1,853 jail inmates had been reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as foreign-born. She also can say that from July to December, when the city started keeping track, ICE came for 410 inmates. (Caveat: ICE doesn’t pick up every jailed illegal immigrant for various reasons — higher priorities, resources. It’s been a sore spot.) The Colorado Department of Corrections website provides a handy monthly inmate report. As of January, 22,910 people were incarcerated in the adult and juvenile systems. Of those, 1,783 were foreign born, and of those, 1,270 had an ICE hold on them. It was a typical month. I tell you this knowing the argument isn’t really about the numbers. It’s not about the stats or the stories, which we can bend and twist and, if not bound by ethics, fictionalize, to lend credence to our own points of view. We are biased creatures, all too willing to accept that which reinforces our beliefs, and so a man from Arizona forwards the e-mail column with the words: “Somebody really did their homework on this one. Best on the subject to present date.” ","Immigration"
