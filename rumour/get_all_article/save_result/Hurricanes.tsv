"Picture of Hurricane Isabel taken at Sea-Fiction!","2015-04-01 22:02:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/isabel/"," The eRumor includes one or sometimes two pictures of strange looking cloud formations said to be of Atlantic Hurricane Isabel in September of 2003. "," Why someone felt the need to say these were pictures from Hurricane Isabel is known only to that person, but they are not. They were posted by an Australian pilot on a website of pictures from Western Australia. TruthOrFiction.com was able to track him down. He says the pictures were taken by a friend of his around the time of Cyclone Graham in February, 2003. The pictures were taken over a two day period in and near Port Hedland. One of them is from the deck of one of the iron ore ships that sail in and out of Port Hedland. The second picture was taken as the storm was adjacent a salt mine at Port Hedland. Port Hedland is frequently affected by cyclones, so much so that the city council has a pre-cyclone clean-up period for three weeks every year in October. updated 7/23/12","Hurricanes"

"A sign from God after hurricane Charlie-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/signfromgod/"," The eRumor says that the high winds of Hurricane Charlie in Florida in 2004 ripped a previous sign from a billboard, leaving a previous billboard visible for all to see that said, “WE NEED TO TALK…GOD” "," Hurricane Charlie was one of four hurricanes to devastate portions of Florida during the 2004 hurricane season. In Orlando, the winds peeled away a current billboard leaving the remnants of a previous billboard campaign and displayed the timely message from God. The old billboard was part of a series that were created by Andy Smith and Charlie Robb of the Smith Agency in Fort Lauderdale. The billboards were paid for by a person who asked to remain anonymous and who asked the Smith Agency to run the campaign from September to November of 1998. The roadside announcements were actually the work of Andy Smith and Charlie Robb of The Smith Agency in Fort Lauderdale. The advertising firm was hired last summer by a person requesting anonymity. Their instructions: Create and execute a marketing campaign from September to November that would get people thinking about God. The successful campaign prompted a request from the Outdoor Advertising Association of America to ask for permission to use the billboards elsewhere in the United States. According to the Wall Street Journal, they appeared in more than 200 cities. Updated 11/5/04 ","Hurricanes"
"Physician’s criticism of hurricane survivors in Texas-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricane-criticism/"," The eRumor is from a doctor named Richard Johnson who says he volunteered to help hurricane survivors who were brought to Houston after hurricane Katrina in 2005. He started his mission with compassion but ended it with anger toward some of the survivors who he said had a welfare mentality, were not grateful, and would not volunteer to help. "," This is another example of a person forwarding an email that he did not write but it has been circulated as though he wrote it. Dr. Richard Johnson says he is not the author of this email and that he has not been in Texas for more than 10 years. He does recall seeing the message and forwarding it but that’s it. Subsequent versions of the eRumor have been sent around the world with his name and contact information at the bottom of the email making it appear as though he originated it.

The eRumor claims that the croc is more than 80 years old and is too aged to catch animals so was looking for people instead. The story claims that the reptile was shot by Army troops “last Sunday” and that its carcass is in a freezer at the Azur Hotel. "," This story is a hoax. The pictures are authentic but are of a crocodile that was captured in Congo, Africa, long before hurricane Katrina. Some versions say it’s an alligator that was found in the streets. The references to Army troops and the Azur Hotel are of Congo. Better estimates of the size of the croc are about 16 feet long and more than 1,000 pounds. Updated 9/20/05 ","Hurricanes"
"Petiton to President Bush for lower gas prices after Katrina-Grass rootseffort!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricane-gas-prices/"," This is a petition for you to add your name to and forward to others. After 2000 names, it is to be sent to President Bush asking him and Congress to lower gas and Diesel prices in the U.S. This was in response to the rising gas and diesel prices after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina along the U.S. Gulf Coast and it’s affect on the U.S. oil industry. "," This is a grass roots effort that was       started by someone somewhere who thought it would be a good idea. It reflects the frustration over spikes of gas and diesel prices       after Hurricane Katrina and at a time when gas and diesel prices       were already at historic highs. Efforts  like this feel powerful to many people because of the       knowledge that petitions have accomplished a lot of change from time       to time in our democratic culture. Emails like this one, however, are not effective and for several       reasons. Normally, a petition has significance because it represents people       who registered voters and who have authenticated their participation       by providing a signature and address that can be verified. An email petition that simply has names listed on it is virtually       meaningless because anybody who wanted to take the time could       fabricate a list of names and send it to a government office or       elected official. There is no way of validating that the names listed are real people       and that they signed on to the petition. Another problem with this kind of petition is that it relies someone       along the way to be responsible for sending it to the intended       ultimate destination, which doesn’t often happen. The best thing to do when you want elected officials to hear your       opinion is to find the email address, fax, or phone number for their       offices and communicate to those offices directly using your own       name and contact information. A third problem with this particular petition is that rises and       drops in oil and gas prices are the result of complex factors both       internationally and locally and it doesn’t always mean that your       local gas station or the oil company it works with is making a       killing financially. The rise in prices after the Hurricane were affected by the very       real factors such as a severe disruption in American oil production. ","Hurricanes"

Summary of the eRumor: The eRumor says that during the week that Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States, a homosexual event called “Southern Decadence Day” was due to take place in New Orleans. The eRumor also says that gambling casinos were in the eye of the storm. The email also says that the storm was brewing in the Atlantic at the same time that Israeli’s were being forced out of their homes in Gaza. The Bible is then quoted where “sea and waves roaring” is predicted as well as “men’s hearts failing them for fear.” "," First, the name of the event is “Southern Decadence.” It was scheduled to take place from August 31 to September 5 and had become a Labor Day tradition in the French Quarter of New Orleans. According to promotional materials about Southern Decadence, it was to involved more than 100,000 mostly gay and lesbian participants and generate more than $100 million in tourist dollars.

"Gas Rationing because of Hurricane Katrina?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricane-rationing/"," This is an email that started shortly after Hurricane Katrina in the United States saying that an oil refinery called together the employees and told them to keep their tanks full because gas rationing will be starting soon. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not found any       substantiation for this story. It is written in the unconvincing way of false eRumors. At the time that it started circulating, almost immediately after       Hurricane Katrina, there had not been enough assessment of the       impact of the Hurricane on American oil supplies to have predicted       whether rationing would be necessary or whether the President would       authorize dipping into U.S. oil reserves.  There was some short       term localized gas rationing after the hurricanes but nothing on a       national scale.

"Forward an email for the Red Cross for victims of hurricaneKatrina-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricane-redcross/"," There are a couple of versions of this eRumor. One is said to be from a person named Brenda or Loily and says that the Red Cross has offered to give fifty cents for every email that she and her co-workers send. She asks that when the number of forwards reaches 50 the email be sent back to her. The second asks you to forward an email from the Red Cross to others that will generate fifty cents for Hurricane Katrina victims for every fifty emails that are forwarded. "," TruthOrFiction.com regards both of       these email as hoaxes and for a couple of reasons. First, the American Red Cross needs all the       help it can get for hurricane relief in the Gulf states of the U.S.,       but it is not asking for it through forwarded emails. Second, here is no system being used on the Internet to trace forwarded       emails for the purpose of compensating yourself or anyone else. This is a very common type of eRumor in the aftermath of a disaster. This one is a bit unusual in that it asks to be sent back to the       originator after 50 names have accumulated.

"Rumors among survivors of hurricane Katrina-Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricane-rumors/"," One of the more alarming stories to come out of New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was reports of rapes in the Superdome and two children whose throats were cut, a 7-year old who was raped and killed, and widespread reports in Baton Rouge of carjackings and other mayhem. "," If you ever find yourself in the       midst of a natural disaster or other crisis that affects a large       number of people, brace yourself for rumors. Whether they start because of sincere misinformation or because of       intentional misinformation, they can spread like wildfire,       especially during a time when other types of communication are not       working. These stories about the hurricane survivors were reported through       several media including being repeated by survivors interviewed on       television. Most of them believed the stories and repeated them as truth. The story about rapes, killings, and the slitting of two children’s       throats was also reported in an article in the Guardian of London on       September 5. They quoted witnesses as saying, “During this time, they said,       girls and boys were raped in the dark and had their throats cut and       bodies were stuffed in the kitchens while looters and madmen       exchanged fire with weapons they had looted.” TruthOrFiction.com has checked with New Orleans police. They say they’ve not been able to confirm the story of the babies       with the throats cut or even any rapes from among those who took       refuge in the Superdome. If those events did happen, nobody has come forward to report them       or substantiate them. One rumor that spread through the refugees was that a       7-year-old-girl had been raped and killed, but there has not been       any evidence found so far of that murder. The London Guardian ran a story on September 6 saying that they,       too, have not been able to confirm any of the rape and killing       stories or the stories of bodies stacked in the kitchen at the       Superdome. The Guardian said it had not been able to find any substantiation of       any dead bodies at the Superdome at all, much less the bodies of       children. In Baton Rouge, the Mayor-President Kip Holden declared a curfew       because of fears and reports of violence, but police there now say       there was no violence except in rumors.","Hurricanes"
"Help the Victims of Hurricane Katrina","2015-03-17 20:42:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hurricanerelief/"," Various emails asking for support for victims of Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast of the United States. "," The devastation of hurricane Katrina       has prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support from       people who want to help those who have been       affected. TruthOrFiction.com has had a lot of experience with humanitarian       relief efforts and we have some recommendations that will help       ensure that the support you give will go to the people who need it. 1.  If you get an email requesting donations for hurricane victims, don’t respond directly to the email or any links in the       email, even if it seems to be from a trusted organization. The reason is that you may get an email from crooks who merely       want to capture your personal information including your credit       card. The safest thing to do is to go directly to the website of the       organization or call them by phone. If you don’t know the web address, use Google or some other search       engine to find it. 2.  Donate only to trusted organizations who have a       reputation for doing the kind of work that you believe in and,       preferably, already work in the areas affected by the hurricane. This is a biggie. A disaster of this proportion inspires us all to want to help. One of the difficulties, however, is that well-meaning people and       organizations start grass-roots efforts that either don’t help or,       in some cases, inadvertently end up being a hindrance. That’s why it’s best in the long-run to simply donate to       organizations that are already there, that do this on a regular       basis, that have personnel at the scene, that have the best channels       for receiving and distributing the aid, and that know exactly what       the needs are. Even as I write this, there are campaigns in various cities to       collect food, clothing, diapers, blankets, and other supplies, but       the chances for those goods actually getting to the people who need       them are poor. It is heartbreaking to be on the scene of a disaster and know that       there are airplanes that cannot land because nobody was expecting       them, goods being stockpiled at an airport or a dock because there       is no arrangement for being able to distribute them, and tons of       supplies that are either not helpful to the relief effort or, if       they are, will have to be sorted and there is not enough personnel       or time to do that. The bottom line is that we all need to help but we also need to make       sure that our help will get to the people who need it.","Hurricanes"

"Responder’s First Hand Report from Haiti-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/haiti-diary/"," This is a forwarded email with an account from Haiti by a rescue worker named Nick Brockhausen. After his return from the earthquake stricken Haiti he reported on what he called the incompetence of the United States Agency for International Development. The email also speaks negatively of the Obama Administration, The United Nations and the Haitian people. "," Nick Brockhausen has not   responded to our inquiries but this email may be a debrief or vent sent privately to friends or family members who   forwarded it on to friends in their distribution list. Brockhausen cited problems of   what he regarded as incompetence of United States Agency for   International Development (USAID) owing to lack of sanitation resources,   security issues and language challenges. The email began   circulating in late January 2010, weeks after a devastating    earthquake measuring over 7.0 on the Richter scale shook the Haitian   capitol, Port Au Prince, for 35 seconds.   Over 100,000 lives   have been reported lost by the natural disaster.      According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the USAID   is the lead “U.S. Government office responsible for providing   humanitarian assistance in response to international emergencies and   disasters.” Different versions of the email   appeared on the internet, some blocking out the names, others saying the   two responders returning from Haiti were doctors, dentists, ham radio   operators or firemen. TruthorFiction.com has confirmed that   Brockhausen and the other person mentioned in the email, Dennis Hebler,   are real and were part of the relief efforts in Haiti. Hebler told   TruthOrFiction.com that this was not his opinion and that he was “focused   on the job at hand and didn’t make any reference to anything else either   good or bad.” He went on to tell us “As far as I am concerned the   situation down there was overwhelming and it would have been difficult   for anyone to have functioned at a high level of competence.” According to their   website, USAID is trained in the FEMA Incident Response System, a special   series of special courses that all US law enforcement and emergency   response agencies must learn.  This is the same training that was   used by the US Coast Guard in relief efforts in the aftermath from   Hurricane Katrina.  USAID also teaches the FEMA courseware to   emergency responders internationally. It is not known if   Haitian responders had been trained in the FEMA course prior to the   earthquake. Updated 02/17/10 ","Hurricanes"
