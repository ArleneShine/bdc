"Baby Dies from Vicks VapoRub-Unproven!","2016-11-29 08:41:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/baby-dies-vicks-vaporub/"," A mother has recounted how her two-year-old infant died after she applied Vicks VapoRub to him to treat a simple fever. "," We couldn’t find any credible accounts of a baby dying after Vicks Vapor Rub was applied — but the product label clearly states that it should not be applied to children younger than two. Rumors that a baby died from Vicks VapoRub began circulating on blog sites in mid-November. Blog posts like this one recount how an unnamed “Mexican mother” lost her two-year-old child after applying Vicks VapoRub to his nose: A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby. When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him. She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him. She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing. We couldn’t find any reports of a baby dying after having Vick VapoRub applied. Given that these blog posts don’t provide names or specific details for us to track down, there’s no way to confirm or debunk the rumor, so we’re calling this one “unproven.” Back in 2009, ABC News filed a report under the headline, “Vicks VapoRub Misuse May Hurt Infants.” The report told the story of an 18-month-old child with an upper respiratory infection who had to be admitted to the emergency room after Vicks VapoRub led to “severe” breathing problems because it increased mucus production: According to a case report published in the journal Chest by Dr. Bruce Rubin and his colleagues, the child was recovering relatively well while battling her respiratory infection until about two hours before she was admitted to the emergency room. When doctors began questioning the patient’s grandparents about what might have caused the girl’s respiratory distress, the only answer her grandparents could come up with was that they had rubbed Vicks VapoRub under the child’s nose earlier that day. “Sure enough, we demonstrated that the Vicks produced increased mucous in the patient’s airway, which was already inflamed and narrowed because of her respiratory infection,” Rubin explained. To confirm that the menthol-containing rub was responsible for the patient’s respiratory stress, researchers tested the product on ferrets. Indeed, they found that exposure to VapoRub increased mucous production, thereby causing inflammation in the rodents’ airways. But Rubin said the case should be viewed as “an isolated incident” and that the product clearly states it shouldn’t be used on children younger than two. And Rubin said people should never apply VapoRub to the nose area. A spokesperson for Proctor and Gamble, the company that makes Vicks VapoRub, told CBC News as much back in 2009: Crystal Harrel, a spokesperson for Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati, said complaints are rare and the product is sound. “Vicks VapoRub has a long-standing history of being safe and effective when used according to package directions. Where marketed, it is in compliance with the applicable health and safety regulations.” In the end, the report of a baby dying from Vicks VapoRub is unproven, but parents should always follow product label instructions and never apply it to children younger than two.

"Claims About Brain-Boosting Inteligen Pill Supplement-Unproven!","2016-10-11 09:47:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-brain-boosting-inteligen-pill-supplement/"," Benefits of the power of a supplement called “Inteligen” to increase intelligence have been trumpeted by the likes of CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Stephen Hawking. "," There’s no scientific proof that Inteligen actually increases intelligence, focus or memory recall — so you should be leery of any promises that it makes. The issue with products like Inteligen is that they’re considered “supplements” under the law, so the FDA does not subject them to oversight. That means the maker of Inteligen doesn’t have to back up its spectacular claims that the supplement can “enhance focus, boosts intelligence and increase your productivity.” Inteligen’s website describes the product as a blend of “nutrients, amino acids and vitamin B6” that boosts brain function. Those ingredients and claims are so vague that they’re impossible to fact-check. And rumors that Stephen Hawking backed Inteligen in an interview with Anderson Cooper have been used to lend credibility to the supplement — but they’re not true. The same tactic has been used to make it (falsely) appear that Cooper and Hawking have endorsed a number of brain-boost supplements, and Inteligen is just the most recent. One article, for example, reports that Hawking talked about the benefits of a different brain-boosting supplement, BrainPlus IQ, during an interview with Cooper. In later versions, “BrainPlus IQ” will simply be repalced with “Inteligen”: In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Stephen Hawking said that his ability to predict the future doesn’t exist, but his brain is sharper than ever, more clear and focused, and he credits a large part to using BrainPlus IQ. Hawking went on to add “The brain is like a muscle, you have to work it out and use supplements just like body builders use, but for your brain, and that’s exactly what I’ve been doing to enhance my mental capabilities”. The interview never took place, and we couldn’t find any record of Hawking actually endorsing any brain-boosting supplements. The medical director of the Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute at the University of South Florida said supplements like Inteligen and BrainPlus IQ “give people false hope,” The Tampa Bay Times reports : Many doctors say the supplements lack scientific evidence to prove they work, and as nutritional supplements, they are not regulated by the federal government as are medications. The ads tout clinical trials, but these are at best small, short-term tests published in journals that are not well-known or respected — hardly comparable with accepted medical standards. Some brain supplements do contain ingredients that have been studied extensively and are used widely for memory disorders. The moss extract huperzine A, found in Procera AVH (a different brain-boosting supplement), has similar properties to the Alzheimer’s drug Aricept, and is the most common treatment for Alzheimer’s in China, Smith said. But with vague labeling and little regulation, there’s no way to know how much of these ingredients are in any supplement, or how high their quality is. In the end, there’s no scientific proof that any of these supplements work. Talk to your doctor before trying them, or avoid them all together. ","Health - Medical"
"Flu Shots Cause Alzheimer’s Disease-Fiction!","2016-10-07 13:38:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/flu-shots-cause-alzheimers-disease/"," Flu shots contain toxins and ingredients that can destroy your brain and cause Alzheimer’s disease. "," Flu shots do not lead to Alzheimer’s or memory loss — research actually suggests that flu vaccines may be able to help prevent Alzheimer’s. While most doctors and scientists have rejected the theory that mercury used in some types of flu shots leads to Alzheimer’s disease, a handful of fringe doctors continue to spread those rumors using arguments that are easy to discredit. In 2014, Newsmax published a report under the headline “Some Flue Shot Formulations Contain Brain-Destroying Toxin: Top Doctor.” The “top doctor” cited in the report is Dr. David Brownstein, a self-described holistic family physician who warns about the dangers of mercury in flu shots: Thimerosal, a preservative found in manyflu shots, is 50 percent mercury. It’s different, and much more harmful, than the type of mercury found in fish. While the FDA warns against eating more than two servings of fish weekly because of the danger of mercury, it allows this more toxic form to be added to flu shots (and other vaccines). The only reason thimerosal is added is as a preservative in multi-dose vials. Known as ethylmercury, this type of mercury in flu shots depresses the immune system and damages the brain. Much of ethylmercury is converted in the body to a form of mercury that accumulates in the brain with every annual flu shot and is very difficult to remove. Ethylmercury is much more harmful than methylmercury, the form of mercury found in fish, and is much more likely to stay in the brain. For years, thimerosal has been associated with an increase in autism, but one of the most troubling connections is with Alzheimer’s. “ There’s no doubt that the flu vaccine can lead to Alzheimer’s, because many flu shots are preserved with mercury and it’s a known brain toxin,” says Dr. Brownstein. “You give enough brain toxins and people are going to develop memory issues.” Brownstein’s claim is at least partially true. Multi-dose vial flu vaccines contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that prevents germs, bacteria and fungi from contaminating the vaccine. But here’s where Brownstein’s claims go awry: ethylmercury is easily passed through the body, which makes it far less likely to cause harm. The CDC explains the difference like this : Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth’s crust, air, soil, and water.  Two types of mercury to which people may be exposed — methylmercury and ethylmercury — are very different. Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in certain kinds of fish. At high exposure levels methylmercury can be toxic to people. In the United States, federal guidelines keep as much methylmercury as possible out of the environment and food, but over a lifetime, everyone is exposed to some methylmercury. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is cleared from the human body more quickly than methylmercury, and is therefore less likely to cause any harm. The CDC concluded that “s tudies show no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines,” and its considered a very safe additive. Besides that, Canadian researchers actually found that older adults who receive flu shots and other vaccines actually appear to be at a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease than those who do not receive the vaccination: For each type of vaccine, subjects who reported at least one vaccination were at lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease than those who had never been exposed, after adjustment for age, sex and education. Vaccines against diphtheria or tetanus and against poliomyelitis were associated with statistically significantly lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (60% and 40% lower respectively). Exposure to influenza vaccine was also related to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but the association did not reach statistical significance. Additional adjustment for smoking, alcohol use, family history of dementia, ADL and IADL, chronic diseases and perceived health status yielded similar results. The Alzheimer’s Association has also debunked claims that flu shots have been linked to memory loss or Alzheimer’s itself: A theory linking flu shots to a greatly increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease has been proposed by a U.S. doctor whose license was suspended by the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners. Several mainstream studies link flu shots and other vaccinations to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and overall better health. So, there’s absolutely no proof that flue shots lead to Alzheimer’s or memory loss. Brownstein’s theory fails to acknowledge that there are two different types of mercury, and the type of mercury used in multi-vial flu shots is not the same as the type of toxic mercury that is found in fish.

"EpiPen Maker Donated to Clinton Foundation, Hiked Prices-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-08-25 14:40:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/epipen-maker-donated-clinton-foundation-hiked-prices/"," After Hillary Clinton condemned Mylan, the maker of EpiPens, for increasing prices of the life-saving devices by 400 percent since 2008, allegations that the price hikes were tied to Mylan’s Clinton Foundation donations went viral. "," The Clinton Foundation once partnered Mylan, but the partnership didn’t have anything to do with EpiPens. First, we’ll provide a little context. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch came under fire in August 2016 over her company increasing the price of EpiPens by 400 percent since 2008. Hillary Clinton quickly condemned Mylan’s price hikes, calling them “outrageous” in an official campaign release “That’s outrageous – and it’s just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases.  But it’s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. “That’s why I’ve put forward a plan to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these.  As part of my plan, I’ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value.  Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. FOX Business News accused Clinton of crying crocodile tears about the price hikes in a segment , noting that Mylan had partnered with the Clinton Foundation shortly before the price hikes began. Other outlets picked up the story and showed a picture of Bill Clinton accepting a check from former Mylan CEO Robert Coury in about 2009. Claims that the Clinton Foundation had directly benefits from the EpiPen price hikes, or had in some way shielded Mylan from scrutiny over it, immediately followed. But there’s no proof that either of those things are true. While it is true that the Clinton Foundation announced a partnership with Mylan in 2009 to make second-line antiretroviral (ARV) HIV/AIDS drugs more affordable, that partnership had nothing to do with EpiPens. And the notion that Mylan would have needed protection from the Clinton Foundation to raise the price of EpiPens by 400 percent is wrong. As the New York Times reports , these types of price hikes are legal and common among drug companies: Mylan, while not commenting on why it has repeatedly increased the price, says that most EpiPen users are insured and that the company offers a coupon that can reduce or cover the patient’s co-payments. Such co-payment assistance is part of the standard playbook for companies selling expensive drugs: The goal is to spare the consumer, who might create a political uproar, and yet still get paid by the insurance company or government health program. So, while it’s true that the Clinton Foundation once partnered with Mylan on HIV/AIDs drugs, there’s no proof that the partnership impacted EpiPen prices in any way. Bresch has been called to testify before a congressional panel. ","Health - Medical"
"Sea Lice Attacking Florida’s Beaches-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-06-08 13:11:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sea-lice-attacking-floridas-beaches-truth-misleading/"," Warnings that sea lice have invaded beaches in Florida have sparked panic on social media. "," Warnings about sea lice on Florida beaches are true — but they’re also misleading. Posts began circulating on social media in early June that warned Florida beachgoers of sea lice “invasions” that have left swimmers with painful red welts all over their bodies, like the one pictured here: The photo is real, and it was circulated by Florida public health officials in a warning about sea lice or “seabather’s eruption,” at beaches. Sea lice are actually the larvae of jellyfish, which are nearly invisible in ocean waters but leave simmers with painful red welts on their skin, according to public health officials : For the past 11 years, during the months of March through August, residents and tourists along 250 miles of Florida’s southern Atlantic coastline have complained of an annoying pruritic rash, primarily within areas covered by bathing suits. Although this problem has existed since the early 1900s at least, it has not been formally recognized and understood until recently. The first study (a retrospective case review of ED cases seen during 1992) and a sample population survey were conducted at Boca Raton Community Hospital. The outbreaks appear to have intensified in the last 4 years, as reflected in the number of cases reported as well as the severity of response in individual cases. Because most affected people treat themselves, it is difficult to determine the total annual number of cases. However, a conservative estimate of 10,000 cases in 1992 can be made. So, the phenomenon isn’t new, and most residents of Florida and other warm weather states are well aware of sea lice. In 2016, sea lice outbreaks appeared to be cropping up further west in the Gulf of Mexico than in year’s past, and headed toward Alabama beaches, an NBC affiliate reports . We’re calling warnings about sea lice true, but misleading. Sea lice isn’t necessarily new, and there doesn’t seem to be a greater risk of swimmers being affected by it in 2016 than in year’s past.

"Two Droplets Blog Warns of Drain Cleaner Dangers-Investigation Pending!","2016-02-19 08:08:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/two-droplets-blog-warns-of-drain-cleaner-dangers/"," A blog post titled “Two Droplets” tells the story of a Milwaukee man who suffered a chemical burn on the back of his hand from drain cleaner that has lead to a five-year medical nightmare. "," We don’t have any clear answers on this one. We can’t independently confirm whether or not the claims made in the Two Droplets blog post are true, but our investigation is ongoing. In the blog, the unnamed author tells the horrific story of her husband’s encounter with “two droplets” of drain cleaner in June 2010. After a bathroom sink became clogged, her husband poured drain cleaner directly into a pipe beneath the sink through a funnel. Then, the “funnel burped and two droplets of the chemical hit the back of his hand” and began to eat away at the skin on his hand: The chemical began to eat away at the skin. We lived 5 minutes from a local hospital, so I snapped a photo of the ingredients on the bottle and we headed off to the emergency room. The hospital called poison control and proceeded to follow protocol in treating the chemical burn. He ended up having a skin graft performed to cover the wound area, which was not much larger than a quarter. Done, right? End of story? Not even close. It was only the beginning. After a few uneventful months, the grafted area began to ache. It was an ache that he would become all too familiar with moving forward. The ache was followed by redness in the area, which quickly evolved into necrotic (dead) skin and flesh. The wound spread beyond the grafted area and became a bit larger. He was admitted to the hospital and another graft surgery was performed. It didn’t fix the problem. Neither did the next one, or the next one, or the next one. Over the next five years, the woman wrote, the back of her husband’s hand constantly ached and the skin repeatedly died. The affected area spread until it covered the entire surface of his hand, and doctors have not been able to find a diagnosis, the author continued. A number of doctors who have read the blog have offered possible diagnosis and treatment options in the comment section, including pyoderma gangrenosum and white clot syndrome , which could be a side effect of medication he’s receiving. It’s interesting to note that these conditions would not be caused by the two droplets of drain cleaner that hit the back of the man’s hand. They would be caused by the skin grafts, other health conditions or medications that resulted from his chemical burn. Here’s what we know for sure: drain cleaners can cause severe chemical burns when they come into contact with skin. And drain cleaners become especially dangerous when they’re mixed with other chemicals. These dangerous mixtures can explode from drains and onto skin, as described in the Two Droplets blog post. That’s exactly what happened to a grandmother who owns a bed and breakfast in England in July 2010. She poured “two droplets” — an really odd coincidence — of Extreme Green’s Dr. Drain into a sink. After a few seconds there was a gurgling sound and then chemicals suddenly exploded from the drain, causing severe burns on her face, the Daily Mail reports : Doctors at Southampton General Hospital told her that it was only because of her quick-thinking to keep her eyes closed that her sight was saved. Mrs Insch, a grandmother of ten, from Netley Abbey, Hampshire, said: ‘I read the instructions and put two drops in, we hadn’t used any other product that day, only the plunger. ‘It started to bubble so I turned round to see what was happening and it exploded, it hit the ceiling and went straight into my face. Shocked: Sheila Insch pictured grandaughter Ceri Roper ‘I just grabbed something to wipe my face and I kept my eyes closed as my eyes are very valuable to me. ‘I kept washing my face all the way to hospital. It was terribly painful, burning, it hurt. ‘The doctor said my quick actions saved my face but he said I can’t go out in the sun for a year.’ Mrs Insch, who runs Telemark House B&B, was rushed to hospital by her daughter Gwen, but was transferred to the specialist burns unit at Salisbury Odstock Hospital, where she stayed for three days. That story is eerily similar to the one told in the Two Droplets blog. The two events even happened within a month of each other. A chemist for Extreme Green’s Dr. Drain said the company was assisting in the investigation, but he said the product is safe when used properly: He added: ‘It clearly states that this product will react violently if it is in contact with other products and I would suspect there was something else down her drain for it to react in such a way. ‘Incidents like this are very rare.’ Out investigation into the Two Drops blog is ongoing.

"Doctors Expose Zika Virus Hoax-Fiction!","2016-02-16 08:36:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doctors-expose-zika-virus-hoax/"," Doctors in South America have found that an insecticide used in crop dusting causes the birth defect microcephaly, not the Zika virus. "," The Zika virus isn’t a hoax. Claims that a birth defect thought to be caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus has actually been linked to a chemical used to kill mosquitoes are nothing more than conspiracy theories at this point. But it’s true that global public health officials aren’t 100% certain that the Zika virus is to blame for an outbreak of microcephaly — a birth defect that causes undersized heads and incomplete brain development — in northern Brazil, either. That’s left the door open for a wide range of conspiracy theories, including this one. Even so, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that researchers are finding “an increasing body of evidence about the link between Zika virus and microcephaly,” but more research is needed, and other cause are being investigated. The Zika virus, which is transmitted by mosquitos, has been found in humans since the 1950s. In adults, the virus causes flu-like symptoms. And a growing body of research is suggesting that a new variation of the Zika virus strain is causing microcephaly in newborn babies. There have been 460 confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil, and another 3,850 cases are being investigated. The common link between babies born with with microcephaly is that they all test positive for the Zika virus, the BBC reports : Scientists told the BBC that samples taken from the brain tissue of the two babies showed that the Zika virus was still actively present. The research was conducted by scientists from Rio’s Federal University (UFRJ), Fiocruz Institute and Paraiba’s Professor Amorim Neto Research Institute. The scientists have been following the pregnancies of 10 women in the north-eastern state of Paraiba – the second worst-hit by cases of microcephaly. One of the researchers who made the possible connection between Zika and brain defects, Dr Adriana Melo, told the BBC that cases she has seen in the north-east of Brazil “are never microcephaly alone” – but include other brain disorders such as dilated ventricles, calcifications and contractures to the joints. The BBC’s Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro says that the findings add more evidence to results announced last week by scientists in the US and Slovenia who detected the virus in samples from other babies with microcephaly. On Monday, a team at the PUC-Parana University in the south of Brazil also announced to have found the virus in tissues taken from babies with microcephaly who died after birth. Still, uncertainty about what, exactly, has been causing microcephaly has left the door open for conspiracy theorists. A group of South American physicians called the Crop-Sprayed Villages issued a report arguing that microcephaly can be linked to the use of an insecticide called pyroproxyfen that has allegedly been used on drinking water reservoirs in areas hardest hit by microcephaly cases. According to the report : Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added pyriproxyfen to drinking water is not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on Zika virus for this damage, while trying to ignore its responsibility and ruling out the hypothesis of direct and cumulative chemical damage caused by years of endocrine and immunological disruption of the affected population. Doctors from the Brazilian Association for Collective Health (ABRASCO) demand that urgent epidemiological studies taking into account this causal link be carried out, especially when among 3,893 cases of malformations confirmed until January 20, 2016, 49 children have died and only five of them were confirmed to have been infected with Zika(1). However, an immunologist named Tirumalai Kamala pushed back against those claims. She wrote that two different reports show evidence of Zika in the placenta and brains of fetuses from miscarriages and from children born with microcephaly to mothers that have been diagnosed with Zika, which should leave little doubt. Also, the Crop-Sprayed Villages theory doesn’t hold up to scientific review, Kamala wrote: A larvicide used to kill Aedes aegypti larvae, pyriproxifen is sprayed all the time. Why then did microcephaly arise in a relatively small proportion of children and why did it only start to show up from ~Dec 2015 when pyriproxifen’s been sprayed in Brazil at least through all of 2014 and 2015? Brazil’s health authorities mention the link with the 1st trimester of pregnancy. If larvicide causes microcephaly, gestation period shouldn’t matter. There seems to be no obvious connection between larvicide spray and 1st trimester of pregnancy. OTOH, for a virus, especially for one with apparently newly developed neurtropism, early stage of pregnancy would be a window of opportunity to make its way past a not-yet-fully formed placenta and infect the developing fetal brain. After all, the observed Guillain–Barré syndrome during the 2013 French Polynesian outbreak fits with a newly developed neurotropic propensity for Zika. Molecular studies show Zika has clearly changed considerably during its recent journey through Asia after it came out of Africa. Pyriproxyfen has been widely used and studied around the world ( including in the U.S. ). If the chemical was truly behind microcephaly, a jump in cases would be reported everywhere, not just concentrated in northern Brazil. Given all that, we’re ruling claims that the Zika virus is a hoax as “fiction.”","Health - Medical"
"Left-Handed People Qualify for Disability-Fiction!","2016-01-28 13:05:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/left-handed-people-qualify-for-disability/"," A viral report claims that left-handed people are now eligible to receive Social Security benefits to compensate for their “disability.” "," There’s bad news for lefties: They don’t qualify for Social Security disability benefits. That rumor started with the fake news website Mouth Wire in February 2015. The story went viral in January 2016 as lefties apparently celebrated news that, “As of February 1st, people suffering from severe cases of left-handedness may be eligible to receive Social Security benefts.” The story goes on to report: President of the Left-Handed Nondiscrimination Association (LHNA) Mary Cavil told us, “We’ve been fighting a long time for this day. Left-handedness is associated with creativity and going against the grain, but what people don’t seem to realize is that many of us struggle with everyday tasks like adjusting the car stereo or using a can opener. And others are subject to harsh discrimination, being told by school teachers that writing left-handed is a sign of the devil.” Of course, the Left-handed Nondiscrimination Association (LHNA) does not exist. Nor does the “Justice for Dexterously Challenged Act” cited in the article. Mouth Wire identifies itself as a “purely satirical web publication intended for entertainment purposes only,” so don’t believe anything you read there. But, in case your wondering, doctors have actually looked into whether or not being left-handed is a handicap, and they found the answer to be “yes and no.” Dr. Adrian Flatt of the Baylor University Medical Center explored ideas about a “left-handed handicap” in a paper published in 2008 . The paper explored disadvantages to lefties who live in a “right-handed world.” Turns out, lefties are far more susceptible to hand injuries. Left-handed industrial workers are five times more susceptible to finger amputations.

"A 54-Year-Old Consulting Engineer’s Obamacare Experience-Truth!","2016-01-27 12:27:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/a-54-year-old-consulting-engineers-obamacare-experience/"," An unnamed 54-year-old consulting engineer explains says in a Facebook post that he makes $60,000 a year and pays $482 per month for health insurance, and his girlfriend makes $18,000 a year and pays $1 per month. "," We can’t confirm whether or not the 54-year-old consulting engineer from the Facebook post is real, but the healthcare scenario outlined in the post is mostly accurate. The consulting engineer says he lives in Monterrey County, California. Because he makes $60,000 a year, which is equal to 510% of the federal poverty level (FPL), he would not qualify for premium subsidies, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator tool . His monthly premium for a high-deductible “bronze” health care plan on Covered California, the state-run health insurance exchange, would cost $491 per month. The cost of the cheapest “silver” plan, meanwhile, would be $704 per month, according to Covered California price quotes . The consulting engineer also wouldn’t qualify for a second form of government assistance, cost sharing reductions. These are subsidies that reduce co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for those who qualify. People with a household income of up to 250% of the FPL ( $29,425 for a single-person household in 2015 ) qualify for these cost-sharing reductions, according to Covered California. Because the engineering consultant is at 510% of the poverty line, he doesn’t qualify. Meanwhile, the engineering consultant’s 61-year-old girlfriend, who earns $18,000 per year, which is equal to 153% of the poverty level, qualifies for up to $887 a month in premium assistance. That’s about $10,641 per year, according to the same subsidy calculator tool . With government subsidies, the 61-year-old woman would pay $1 per month for a bronze health insurance plan. Or, she could choose to pay $42 per month for a sliver plan with a lower deductible, according to Covered California price quotes . So, even though we can’t verify the identity of the engineering consultant in the Facebook post, we can confirm that the health insurance scenario outlined in the post is mostly true. The only difference is that health insurance rates were slightly higher in real life than was quoted in the Facebook post. ","Health - Medical"
"The Dangers of String or Hair on Baby Toes-Truth!","2016-01-22 09:33:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/the-dangers-of-string-or-hair-on-baby-toes/"," Toe tourniquet syndrome happens when a piece of hair or string becomes wrapped so tightly around a baby’s toes that it cuts off circulation and sometimes leads to amputation. "," Toe tourniquet syndrome is a real threat to babies, but it doesn’t happen very often. Warnings about the dangers of string or hair becoming tightly wrapped around a baby’s toe and cutting off circulation gained widespread attention in 2012. That’s the year author Pam Belluck’s book “Island Practice: Cobblestone Rash, Underground Tom and Other Adventures of a Nantuket Doctor” was released. In the book, Belluck recounts how Dr. Timothy Lepore’s encountered toe tourniquet syndrome: He even saved the toes of a two-month-old by spotting the rare “toe-tourniquet syndrome,” which is caused by hair wrapping around infants’ toes and cutting off circulation. Because 90% of mothers experience postpartum hair loss, babies are most at risk when they’re between four days and 19 months old. Dr. Muhammad Ali Hussain, the senior plastic surgery registrar at Canberra Hospital in England, told the Daily Mail he’s seen three or four cases of toe tourniquet syndrome: ‘They get entangled and the mother doesn’t notice what has happened until the time they start crying and they don’t know exactly what is happening, why they are crying. ‘By the time they present it’s already a couple of days and it has been cutting through the toe. ‘In a fair-coloured child and with blonde-coloured hair you can’t identify there is a hair. ‘Even under a microscope it’s difficult.’ And it turns out that baby toes aren’t the only appendages in danger. An article published by Pediatrics medical journal in 1988 reported that fingers, toes and external genitalia could all be in danger. Doctors discussed six cases — all infants between 12 days and 5 months old — in which hair or fiber was removed from toes before any long-term damage was done. After reviewing literature, they found 60 documented cases — 24 involving toes, 14 involving fingers and 22 involving genitals: The majority of the toe and external genitalia cases were caused by hair, whereas the majority of finger strangulations were caused by thread from mittens. At greatest risk for strangulation are the middle finger and third toe, followed by the index finger and second toe. Patients with finger or penile involvement were more likely to suffer significant complications from the injuries than those patients with toe involvement. Based on our own experience and that described in the literature, we recommend prompt removal of the offending fiber, followed by prolonged conservative management of the damaged distal tissue, in the hope of maximal tissue salvage. Increased physician awareness of this syndrome is mandatory for prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment. There’s no current data on how common string-hair tourniquet syndrome is, but plenty of credible first-person accounts are relatively easy to find online. The most common symptoms are fingers or toes appearing purple or swollen, or a baby being in distress for no apparent reason. ","Health - Medical"
"Crest ProHealth Toothpaste Leaves Blue Beads in Your Gums-Outdated!","2016-01-08 14:12:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/crest-prohealth-toothpaste-leaves-blue-beads-in-your-gums/"," There’s buzz that Crest Pro Health Tooth Paste contains blue beads, or polyethylene, that can become lodge in your gums, allowing bacteria to enter. "," Dentists raised concerns about the tiny blue beads found in some types of Crest ProHealth Tooth Paste back in 2014, but manufacturer Proctor & Gamble has already taken steps to get rid of them. The controversy started back in March 2014 when dental hygienist Trish Walraven wrote a blog headlined “Crest toothpaste embeds plastic in our gums” for the blog site Dental Buzz. Walraven wrote that she had found tiny blue beads of polyethylene plastic lodged in the gum lines of her patients: Around our teeth we have these little channels in our gums, sort of like the cuticles around our fingernails. The gum channel is called a sulcus, and it’s where diseases like gingivitis get their start. A healthy sulcus is no deeper than about 3 millimeters, so when you have hundreds of pieces of plastic being scrubbed into your gums each day that are even smaller than a millimeter, many of them are getting trapped. The thing about a sulcus is that it’s vulnerable. Your dental hygienist spends most of their time cleaning every sulcus in your mouth, because if the band of tissue around your tooth isn’t healthy, then you’re not healthy. You can start to see why having bits of plastic in your sulcus may be a real problem, sort of like when popcorn hulls find their way into these same areas. Ouch, right? Walraven didn’t claim that polyethylene left behind after you brush causes gum problems. There’s no scientific proof of that. Still, other dentists across the country followed suit in sounding alarms that polyethylene plastic beads could cause dental hygiene problems because the sulcus is so sensitive. According to Proctor & Gamble ingredient listings , polyethylene was used in nine different types of Pro Health Toothpastes at the time: Crest ProHealth for Me Crest ProHealth for Life Crest ProHealth Enamel Shield Crest ProHealth Sensitive + Enamel Shield Crest ProHealth Intensive Clean Crest ProHealth Healthy Fresh Crest ProHealth Whitening Toothpaste Crest ProHealth Night Toothpaste Crest ProHealth Toothpaste One of the dental community’s biggest gripes about the little blue or green beads in Crest ProHealth Toothpastes was that they don’t provide any oral health benefits. Rather, Proctor & Gamble disclosed in a FAQ (that has since been removed) that polyethylene is “an inactive ingredient used to provide color.” Back in 2014, the company pledged to remove the polyethylene microbeads from all Crest toothpastes by March 2016, Plastic News reports : After months of prodding, Procter & Gamble Co., the makers of Crest brand toothpastes, say PE will be completely removed from its dental products by March 2016. “While the ingredient in question is completely safe, approved for use in foods by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and part of an enjoyable brushing experience for millions of consumers with no issues, P&G understands there is a growing preference for them to remove this ingredient.  So P&G will,” said a company spokesperson, via email. “The majority of Crest product volume will be microbead-free by March 2015. Crest will complete the removal process by March of 2016, well ahead of any state legislation targets.” Also, a number of states have banned the use of polyethylene microbeads in all consumer products. Microbeads found in shampoos, body washes and hand soaps can’t be filtered from wastewater, so they end up in lakes and streams. A report by the New York Attorney General found that water treatment plants across the state couldn’t process 19 tons of microbeads that wash into the state’s water supply each year, which led to them being banned in that state, and many other states. So, concerns about microbeads in consumer products like Crest ProHealth Toothpaste are based in reality, but states and manufacturers have taken steps to end their use. That’s why we’re calling this rumor “outdated.” ","Health - Medical"
"Eating Carrots Improves Your Vision-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-01-06 11:03:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/eating-carrots-improves-your-vision/"," Some are questioning the old adage that eating carrots improves your vision. "," Eating carrots can help improve vision in certain conditions, but the effect of carrots on eyesight has been exaggerated for decades. The reason carrots have been given too much credit for improving vision is rooted in World War II. Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) began using on-board Airborne Inception Radar (IA) to shoot down German planes over London during night in 1940. Because the radar technology was a secret, the Ministry told newspapers that RAF fighter pilots were so precise at night because they ate carrots, which supposedly improved their night vision, the Smithsonian magazine reports : Whether or not the Germans bought it, the British public generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better during the citywide blackouts. Advertisements with the slogan “Carrots keep you healthy and help you see in the blackout”  (like the one pictured below) appeared everywhere. So, the RAF essentially fibbed that carrots were behind its pilot’s nighttime accuracy, and the public ate it up. At some point, it became generally accepted that carrots improve overall vision — not just night vision — and that’s been repeated at countless dinner tables around the world. When it comes to night vision, Emily Chew, the deputy clinical director at the National Eye Institute, backs up the claim that carrots can help. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which the body uses to make vitamin A. Vitamin A helps the eye convert light into a signal that’s transmitted to the brain, which can help improve vision nighttime vision, Chew told Scientific American magazine: But exactly how many carrots would be needed to optimize night vision remains less clear. Most studies have so far looked at the benefits of beta-carotene or vitamin A supplements, not carrots specifically. One randomized control study in 2005 examined how consumption of roughly 4.5 ounces of cooked carrots six days a week stacked up against other vitamin A–rich options such as fortified rice, amaranth leaf and goat liver for helping address night blindness in pregnant women. The result: all the foods performed roughly the same, although the vitamin A supplement did best of all. The study found that a regular diet of the cooked carrots for six weeks helped to bring women’s response to darkness to normal levels. (In Western nations about 30 percent of dietary vitamin A comes from beta-carotene but in some developing countries it is the sole source of vitamin A.) When it comes to improving overall vision and eye health,  however, the answer is a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, not carrots alone, according to the National Eye Institute : You’ve heard carrots are good for your eyes. But eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, particularly dark leafy greens such as spinach, kale, or collard greens is important for keeping your eyes healthy, too.i Research has also shown there are eye health benefits from eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut. But, when it comes to using carrots or any other foods to improve your eyesight, don’t expect too much. Research has found that the body protects itself against excessive amounts of vitamin A because it can become toxic at high levels. So, if you eat nothing but carrots in hopes of gaining 20/20 vision, your body will be working against you the entire time. In conclusion, carrots can improve vision in certain conditions (i.e. at night), and they’re good for overall eye health. Just don’t believe reports that eating carrots (or any other vitamin A rich food) will improve your overall vision. ","Health - Medical"
"Cabela’s Takes a Stand on Medical Excise Tax on Sporting Goods-Fiction!","2016-01-04 08:13:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cabelas-takes-a-stand-on-medical-excise-tax-on-sporting-goods/"," Those who purchase hunting and fishing gear at Cabela’s (and other retailers) now have to pay a medical excise tax established under Obamacare, according to social media posts. "," Obamacare’s medical excise tax doesn’t apply to sporting goods, and Cabela’s isn’t applying it to transactions there. The rumor started with a social media post that showed a Cabela’s receipt with a $5.82 charge for what’s identified as a “medical excise tax” back in 2013. According to the post, the 2.3% medical excise tax was supposed to be “hidden” from customers, but Cabela’s had taken a stand by including the charge as a separate line item on receipts. But Obamacare’s medical excise tax does not apply to sporting goods. Cabela’s mistakenly included the surcharge on customer receipts for one day — January 1, 2013 — and issued refunds to customers within a week. Joe Arterburn, a Cabela’s spokesperson, said that the 2.3% medical excise tax was applied to customer transactions because of a “glitch in the system.” Aterburn said the mistake came to light when customers notified the company that the medical excise tax surcharge had appeared on their sales receipts. The medical excise tax was established under Obamacare to help supplement the cost of providing insurance to the uninsured. Medical professionals pay the excise tax when they purchase medical devices defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) : Medical devices range from simple tongue depressors and bedpans to complex programmable pacemakers with micro-chip technology and laser surgical devices. In addition, medical devices include in vitro diagnostic products, such as general purpose lab equipment, reagents, and test kits, which may include monoclonal antibody technology. Certain electronic radiation emitting products with medical application and claims meet the definition of medical device. Examples include diagnostic ultrasound products, x-ray machines and medical lasers. If a product is labeled, promoted or used in a manner that meets the following definition in section 201(h) of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act it will be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)as a medical device and is subject to premarketing and postmarketing regulatory controls. So, the medical excise tax does not apply to sporting goods, and consumers do not directly pay it. There are excise taxes on sporting goods , but they aren’t new and they weren’t established under the Affordable Care Act. These pre-existing taxes on manufacturers for things like fishing poles, tackle boxes, outboard motors and bows are defined under IRS Publication 510 , which is not the same as the medical excise tax.

"HIPPA Medical Hack for Denied Insurance Claims-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-12-17 12:25:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hippa-medical-hack-for-denied-insurance-claims/"," It’s been rumored that there’s a HIPPA medical hack to reverse insurance claim denials that will save patients money on non-covered medical tests or treatments. "," This HIPPA medical hack claim falls into almost every category: truth, fiction, misleading and unproven. In short, it’s not among strategies recommended by health professionals to appeal an insurance company’s decision to deny an insurance claim. Probably the best way to go about that is to follow procedures for claim denial appeals that were established under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) . First, you can file an internal appeal that requires your insurance provider to provide more information about why your claim was denied so you can (hopefully) make corrections. Then, if you’re still unsatisfied, you can move forward with an independent, external appeal to settle the matter. The HIPPA medical hack claim surfaced in December 2015 on Facebook, which is not a great place to get medical advice. The so-called HIPPA medical hack outlines four steps that (it claims) will force insurance companies to reverse claim denials to avoid HIPPA compliance laws: Let’s start with the first point. Insurance companies have compliance programs to ensure that federal regulations (like HIPPA) are followed, but they’re not “required” to staff a HIPPA compliance officer under the Health Insurance Protection and Portability Act , as is claimed in point 1. Titles of compliance officers will likely vary from company to company, and a compliance officer would likely refer you to the internal appeal system. Also, when it comes to requesting information about an insurance claim denial, you should look to the Employee Retirement Income Security (ERISA) Act of 1974 — not HIPPA, as claimed in point 2. A provision of ERISA details your right to access information pertaining to claim denials : The regulation provides that, in order to allow claimants a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of their claim, a plan’s claims procedures must provide for the identification of medical (or vocational) experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with an adverse benefit determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the determination. Under the rules, plans are not required to automatically provide, as part of a notice of an adverse benefit determination or otherwise, the identity of experts consulted during the claim determination process. Nor are plans required to disclose the name of experts in the absence of an adverse benefit determination. On the other hand, consistent with the procedural requirements of the regulation, the plan must provide the identity of any such experts when requested by a claimant in connection with an adverse benefit determination. See § 2560.503-1(h)(3)(iv) and (4). So, it’s true that insurance companies are required to provide information about experts who were consulted in making their decision to deny your claim — but the nuts and bolts of that fall under ERISA, not HIPPA. Point three claims that “low paid HS graduates” make policy denial decisions at insurance companies, and that’s where this rumor ventures into “unproven” territory. It’s impossible to verify the backgrounds of individuals who work at private insurance companies — but it’s wrong to assume that they’re all “low paid HS graduates.” Finally, in point four, the HIPPA medical hack claims that HIPPA violations should be reported to the U.S. Office of Civil Rights, which is correct. The agency states that complaints may be filed if your “health information privacy rights” have been violated. ","Health - Medical"
"Government Could Withhold up to 30% from Social Security Checks in 2016-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-10-16 12:09:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/government-could-withhold-up-to-30-from-social-security-checks-in-2016/"," Those who receive Social Security will see a 30% reduction in benefits in 2016. "," Reports that a 30% cut could be coming to Social Security benefits checks are both true and false. First, many people have confused the difference between Social Security retirement benefits and Social Security disability benefits. Social Security retirement benefits , which are paid to retired adults who paid into the Social Security system for long enough to qualify, are not in danger of being cut by 30% in 2016. The government collects a 6.2% payroll tax from employees and employers, and 5.3% of that tax goes into the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund to pay Social Security retirement benefits. The possible 30% cut in 2016 applies only to Social Security disability insurance (DI), which pays benefits to about 11 million Americans who are severely disabled. The DI trust fund receives about 0.9% of the payroll tax collected by the government, and the Social Security disability insurance trust fund is in danger of being depleted by the end of 2016, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities : When lawmakers last redirected some payroll tax revenue from OASI to DI in 1994, they expected that step to keep DI solvent until 2016 given anticipated economic and demographic trends. Despite fluctuations in the meantime, current projections still anticipate depletion of the trust fund in 2016 as forecast. DI’s anticipated trust fund depletion does not indicate that the program is out of control or that it is “bankrupt;” if the trust fund were depleted and policymakers took no action, the program could still pay about 80 percent of benefits. But cutting benefits by one-fifth for an extremely vulnerable group of severely disabled Americans is unacceptable. DI’s finances should ideally be addressed in the context of legislation to restore overall Social Security solvency. But even if policymakers make progress toward a well-rounded solvency package before late 2016, which seems unlikely, any changes in DI benefits or eligibility would surely phase in gradually and hence do little to fully replenish the DI fund by 2016. Consequently, policymakers would still need to reallocate payroll tax revenues between the two programs. There is nothing novel or controversial in such a step, and failing to take it would be irresponsible. While some have predicted that Social Security disability benefit payments could be cut by as much as 30% if Congress doesn’t replenish the DI trust fund by the end of 2016, a report released in July 2016 found that the cuts would amount to about 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the New York Times reports : The trustees of Social Security, including three cabinet secretaries, said the disability trust fund would be depleted in the last quarter of 2016. After that, they said, benefits would automatically be cut by 19 percent because revenues, largely from payroll taxes, would be sufficient to cover only 81 percent of scheduled benefit payments. The report sets up a fight between President Obama and Republicans in Congress. Mr. Obama wants to replenish the disability trust fund by shifting some payroll tax revenues from Social Security’s retirement trust fund. Republicans, however, want more significant changes to improve the program’s finances. These changes could include reductions in disability benefits, restrictions on eligibility, new measures to combat fraud or new strategies to help people return to work. In January, Republicans adopted a new rule in the House that could block a direct reallocation of money at the expense of the trust fund that provides benefits for retirees. So, some of the claims about possible 30% cuts to Social Security disability insurance are true, and some are false. The exact amount of the cuts, which have been projected to be anywhere from 19-30%, is unknown. It’s also not known whether Congress will solve the problem before the Social Security disability insurance trust fund runs dry in 2016, which would trigger those cuts. ","Health - Medical"
"23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shots-Fiction!","2015-10-13 13:59:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/23-seniors-died-after-receiving-flu-shots/"," Reports have gone viral that 23 seniors died after receiving flu shots sold at pharmacies. "," Flu vaccines purchased at pharmacies haven’t killed 23 seniors. The rumor that the flu vaccine had killed 23 seniors first surfaced in 2013, but it wasn’t true back then, either. An FDA package insert for the Fluzone high-dose flu vaccine from 2013 stated that 23 seniors had died within 180 days of receiving a flu vaccine — out of a total of 15,992 seniors who participated in clinical trials. The conclusion was that the flu vaccine itself caused none of the 23 deaths: No deaths were reported within 28 days post-vaccination. A total of 23 deaths were reported during the period Day 29–180 post-vaccination: (0.6%) among Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among Fluzone 1 recipients. The majority of these participants had a medical history of cardiac, hepatic, neoplastic, renal, and/or respiratory diseases. No deaths were considered to be caused by vaccination. So, 23 seniors (out of 15,992 who received flu shots in the clinical trials) died from natural causes within six months of receiving the flu shot. That’s not unusual. The website Health Impact News , however, published a report under the headline “Package insert for Fluzone flu vaccine marketed to seniors reveals 23 seniors died during drug trial.” The story, which has been shared nearly 20,000 times on social media sites, questions how the FDA determined that the 23 seniors had died from causes unrelated to the flu vaccine. The simple answer is that it’s not out of the ordinary for 23 seniors out of 15,992 who participate in any clinical trial to die of natural causes within six months. Taking those 23 deaths out of context has created (false) panic that the flu vaccine is potentially fatal, and that has not been proven. In reality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that the flu vaccine saved 40,000 lives over a nine-year span. Many of those prevented deaths were among children and seniors: Estimates from the study showed that the majority of the flu-associated deaths prevented—nearly 89 percent (88.9%)—were in people 65 years of age and older. Next to older people, young children 6 months through 4 years of age benefitted most from flu vaccine in terms of the percentage of deaths averted. Children younger than 5 years old and adults 65 years of age and older are at high risk of serious flu complications and typically account for the majority of flu-associated deaths and have the highest flu-associated hospitalization rates. The study included a breakdown of deaths prevented by season. The most deaths were prevented during the 2012-2013 season, when nearly 9,400 deaths were prevented by vaccination, despite modest estimated vaccine effectiveness that season. Like the current 2014-2015 flu season, H3N2 viruses circulated predominantly during the 2012-2013 season. Studies indicate that flu shots are not potentially fatal for seniors and can help prevent flu-related deaths. ","Health - Medical"

The fake report was quickly shared more than 200,000 times on social media sites. Taken out of context, many readers believed that it was true and questioned the “medical diagnosis” that the girl had been impregnated by a flu shot. One reader commented: As a former resident of San Angelo who learned all too quickly what kids do for fun as their parents overwhelmingly choose to ignore what’s going on right under their noses, I’m pretty confident this girl got pregnant the traditional way.

"Johnson & Johnson Removes Formaldehyde from Baby Products-Truth!","2015-09-21 14:00:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/johnson-johnson-removes-formaldehyde-from-baby-products-truth/"," Johnson & Johnson has removed formaldehyde from baby products like No More Tears shampoo. "," Johnson & Johnson removed formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from its baby products back in 2014. Susan Nettesheim, the vice president of product stewardship and toxicology at Johnson & Johnson, wrote in a 2012 blog post that the company would reformulate its baby products due to consumer concerns over ingredients: Over the past few years, some interest groups have raised questions about the ingredients in personal care products used widely around the world, and they’ve put particular focus on our baby products. At first we were disappointed, because we know that all our products are safe by scientific standards and meet or exceed government regulations. Over time, though, we’ve come to realize that sometimes safety alone isn’t enough. There’s a vigorous public discussion going on around the world about what ingredients should or shouldn’t be in personal care products, and how they should be regulated. We have a point of view that we’ve expressed, based on our considered understanding of the science involved, and that’s always going to be our starting point. But what matters most isn’t what we think, it’s what the people who use our products think. Johnson and Johnson didn’t directly add formaldehyde to its baby products, however. Rather, the company used formaldehyde-releasing ingredients like the ammonia salt quaternium-15 to extend the shelf life of many consumer products, including baby shampoo. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and other consumer groups lauded Johnson & Johnson’s decision to remove these formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from baby products as a “major victory for public health.” However, some toxicology experts have dismissed concerns about formaldehyde-releasing ingredients in baby shampoo as form of hysteria. After all, it’s a naturally-occurring chemical that our own bodies produces, Slate reports : The concern about formaldehyde in personal care products reveals a bit ofchemophobia, which Dartmouth chemistry professor Gordon Gribble defines as “an irrational fear of chemicals based on ignorance of the facts.” He says, “people don’t know how small molecules are, and they believe that single molecules of some chemical pose a health threat.” That’s exactly the concern EWG expressed. “The actual molecule formaldehyde itself is the carcinogen,” says Johanna Congleton, toxicologist and senior scientist at EWG. “It doesn’t matter if it’s in a liquid or if you’re inhaling particles with formaldehyde.” In fact, the only studies that link formaldehyde to cancer are related to humans inhaling it, and inhaling large amounts of it. Funeral industry professionals with more than 34 years of experience or who had performed more than 500 embalmings and factory workers who spent years working around formaldehyde before the 1990s had higher risks for leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The amount of exposure required to cause cancer is so high that other studies of factory workers have been inconclusive. Formaldehyde occurs naturally in common fruits and vegetables (even organic ones). “Unless people calling for removal of quaternium-15 are also keeping their children from eating apples and french fries,” Hartings says, “I think their activism might be misplaced.” Our own bodies create formaldehyde as a normal byproduct during amino acid synthesis and overall metabolism, including breaking down antibiotics and other medications. It’s also in drinking water and the air we breathe. Homer Swei, a scientist at Johnson & Johnson, points out that 90 percent of the formaldehyde around us is naturally occurring, with 60 percent of that coming from plants and trees, yet it’s still perfectly fine to walk through the woods. Further, the formaldehyde in synthetic or manufactured products is no different in terms of chemical structurethan naturally occurring formaldehyde—it’s all CH2O. Nevertheless, Johnson & Johnson elected to remove formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from baby shampoo (and many other products) because of consumer fears. By early 2014, Johnson & Johnson had reformulated many products, the New York Times reports : In doing so, the company is navigating a precarious path, investing tens of millions of dollars to remove the chemicals while at the same time insisting that they are safe. The company is responding, executives said, to a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, as an increasingly informed public demands that companies be more responsive to their concerns, especially when it comes to the ingredients in their products. The complex effort carries both risks and rewards for the health care giant — it requires difficult re-engineering of some of Johnson & Johnson’s most beloved brands, but success in the marketplace could serve as a much-needed boost to a company that has been battered by a series of embarrassing quality lapses and product recalls. In addition to reformulating many of its products, Johnson & Johnson also created a new website to provide consumers with information about its ingredients. Click here for that website.

"Amnesiac Wakes From Coma Speaking Only Ancient Hebrew-Fiction!","2015-09-21 12:38:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/amnesiac-wakes-from-coma-speaking-only-ancient-hebrew/"," A man who spent six days in a coma after an attack awoke speaking ancient Hebrew and has no recollection of his former life. "," A fake news website is behind this hoax. The fictional story of a 53-year-old California man who awoke from a coma speaking only ancient Hebrew first appeared at the fake news website World News Daily Report : The man was found unconscious in a California motel on August 9. He had with him a duffel bag of exercise clothes, a backpack and tennis rackets. He carried a California identification card and a Social Security card, both identifying him as Jamal Miller. When he woke up in the Cedars-Sinai hospital days later, he had no memory of his past and could only speak in an unknown language. For three days, the puzzle remained complete until a rabbi visiting a friend in a nearby room, identified the tongue as ancient Hebrew and was able to communicate with the poor man. The fake report said that the man suffered from “foreign language syndrome,” which occurs when a person speaks a new language after suffering a brain injury. Foreign language syndrome isn’t a legitimate medical condition, but the idea of it got a lot of attention back in 2010 when a Slavic girl allegedly awoke from a coma speaking fluent German, not her native Croatian language. The tale is true, but the girl had actually studied German before her injury, the blog site Neurologica explains : Now the interesting part is that after she woke up from the coma she could speak German a lot more fluently than before and not a word in Croatian. My guess is that Sepsis caused a brain damage in left temporal lobe. Probably mostly in Broca’s Area, thus disabling her in speaking Croatian but not damaging her knowledge of German language. At that point her brain probably switched to best alternative and her passive knowledge of German sprang to life. Without possibility to fall back to Croatian vocabulary there is no dilemma in which words to choose and how to use them so her German must have sounded a lot better to doctors and her parents. So, short of a miracle, there’s no way that a person could wake up speaking fluent ancient Hebrew after a brain injury if they had never studied the language before. ","Health - Medical"
"Synagen IQ Boosts Brain Function and Overall Health-Unproven!","2015-09-02 11:19:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/synagen-iq-boosts-brain-function-and-overall-health/"," An over-the-counter supplement called Synagen IQ boosts brain function, improves memory and promotes overall wellness. "," Claims about the medical benefits of Synagen IQ are unproven. Synagen IQ is classified as a supplement, so the FDA doesn’t regulate it. That means the manufacturer of Synagen IQ doesn’t have to back up its claims that the supplement increases brain power, focus, memory and energy with clinical trials or studies. There’s no way to independently confirm or debunk those claims, either. Synagen IQ is marketed as an “all natural” supplement, but the manufacturer won’t reveal what its active ingredients are. Given all that, it’s impossible to prove whether or not Synagen IQ actually boosts brain function. But so-called miracle drugs that are supposed to reverse memory loss and boost brain function are nothing new. Back in 2010, another over-the-counter supplement called Procera AVH hit the market with an identical claim to “boost brain power.” The medical director of the Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute at the University of South Florida said Procera AVH and similar products “give people false hope.” The Tampa Bay Times reports : Many doctors say the supplements lack scientific evidence to prove they work, and as nutritional supplements, they are not regulated by the federal government as are medications. The ads tout clinical trials, but these are at best small, short-term tests published in journals that are not well-known or respected — hardly comparable with accepted medical standards. Some brain supplements do contain ingredients that have been studied extensively and are used widely for memory disorders. The moss extract huperzine A, found in Procera AVH, has similar properties to the Alzheimer’s drug Aricept, and is the most common treatment for Alzheimer’s in China, Smith said. But with vague labeling and little regulation, there’s no way to know how much of these ingredients are in any supplement, or how high their quality is. So, there’s no scientific or medical research to back up claims that supplements like Synagen IQ actually work. It’s best to talk to your doctor before taking any of these over-the-counter pills, and to not believe claims that aren’t backed up with research. ","Health - Medical"

"Planned Parenthood Sells Body Parts for Profit-Disputed!","2015-07-23 07:52:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/planned-parenthood-sells-body-parts-for-profit/"," An undercover Planned Parenthood video claims that the group sells fetal body parts from partial birth abortions for profit. "," An undercover Planned Parenthood video that claims the group sells body parts from abortions for profit has been disputed. Planned Parenthood said patients who seek abortions can elect to “donate tissue to scientific research.” But the organization disputes that it, or its patients, profits from those donations. The controversy started when and anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress posted an undercover video on YouTube. The video reportedly showed Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood, discussing the sale of fetal tissue and body parts with so-called “potential buyers.” One excerpt from the video — which had nearly 2 million views within days of being posted — captures a conversation between Nucatola and the two people posing as buyers over lunch: Nucatola: Every provider has had patients who want to donate their tissue, and they absolutely want to accommodate them. The just want to do it in a way that is not perceived as, “this clinic is selling tissue, this clinic is making money off of this.” Buyers: Okay, so, when you are, or the affiliate is, determining what that monetary… Nucatola: Yes Buyers: So that it doesn’t raise any question of this is what it’s about, this is the main — what price range would … Nucatola: You know, I would throw a number out, I would say it’s probably anywhere from $30 to $100, depending on the facility and what’s involved. Planned Parenthood responded with a statement that said it follows all state and federal laws related to tissue donations, and that it does not profit from them: In health care, patients sometimes want to donate tissue to scientific research that can help lead to medical breakthroughs, such as treatments and cures for serious diseases. Women at Planned Parenthood who have abortions are no different. At several of our health centers, we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research, and we do this just like every other high-quality health care provider does — with full, appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards. There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or for Planned Parenthood. In some instances, actual costs, such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers, are reimbursed, which is standard across the medical field. The Center for Medical Progress responded that Planned Parenthood had made “key admissions” in its response: Planned Parenthood makes two key admissions in their statement today: 1) aborted fetal parts are harvested at their clinics, and 2) money is exchanged in connection with this. They also tell several lies: 1) That proper consent is obtained from patients, 2) That Planned Parenthood does not make money off the body parts, and 3) that everything is legal. The Center for Medical Progress also released a flier from StemExpress, a California-based biomedical company that (the video claims) purchases fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. The flier discusses the possibility of financial gain for clinics: StemExpress promotes global biomedical research while also providing a financial benefit to your clinic. By partnering with StemExpress, not only are you offering a way for your clients to participate in the unique opportunity to facilities life-saving research, but you will also be contributing to the fiscal growth of your own clinic. The stem cell rich blood and raw materials that are usually discarded during obstetrical procedures can, instead, be expedited through StemExpress to research laboratories with complete professionalism and source anonymity. Nucatola referenced conversations with StemExpress in the video, but she implied that there wasn’t an agreement between the groups in place at the time. Then, in a prepared statement to The Hill , Planned Parenthood said Nucatola was not discussing the sale of body parts and that reimbursements for donated tissue costs were not uncommon: “Deborah Nucatela was speculating on the range of reimbursement that patients can receive after stating they wish to donate any tissue after a procedure,” the organization wrote in a report prepared by its PR firm. “The promotional video mischaracterizing Planned Parenthood’s mission and services is made by a long time anti-abortion activist that has used deceptive and unethical video editing, and that has created a fake medical website as well as a fake human tissue website that purports to provide services to stem cell researchers,” the group wrote in a two-page statement. It also provided several pages of background research about the organization’s use of donated fetal tissue, which it describes as “humanitarian undertaking that hold the potential to cure disease, save lives, and ameliorate suffering.” Planned Parenthood and other critics of the undercover video have argued that it was a carefully edited attack by an anti-abortion group. The Center for Medical Progress (not the same as the Center for Medical Progress at the Manhattan Institute ) has a minimal online footprint, so little is known about the group. But David Daleiden, the group’s self-identified founder , has been a long time anti-abortion activist. In 2009, Daleiden posted another video in which he suggested during a Q&A session that Planned Parenthood had “an institutional tolerance for adult-child sexual relationships,” the Daily Beast reports . So, it’s true that Planned Parenthood donates fetal tissue to medical research. But the claim that Planned Parenthood does so illegally, or profits from it, are disputed. ","Health - Medical"

"," Falling asleep with ear buds in has never killed anyone. Social media sites have lit up with warnings about the dangers of falling asleep with ear buds in while your phone is charging. The first (false) report of a death caused by ear bud electrocution started with the website Paparazzi Jamaica , a digital tabloid that “does not warrant or make representations concerning the accuracy” of its stories. Paparazzi Jamaica reports : A young Filipino girl recharges her phone while her earphone was connected to her both ears and fell asleep. As she was sleeping, the phone overheated, burnt and the electric power went through the earphone and she got electrocuted and died in her sleep. This has happened last night at 11 pm, June 10, 2015. Then, the website News Watch 33 put a new twist on the story. It reported that the a 19-year-old woman named Gabrielle Samuels had been killed in Houston after falling asleep with ear buds in: According to authorities, Samuels fell asleep around 12:15 a.m. in her bedroom. The young woman had finished a conversation with her boyfriend shortly before starting up her playlist. Around 3 a.m. is when the device malfunctioned, resulting in the death of Samuels. Medical examiners at the scene determined Samuels was electrocuted by the iPhone as the cause of death. Officials also discovered that Samuels was not using an official licensed Apple iPhone charger, which they believe contributed to the malfunctioning device. The story was quickly shared nearly 30,000 times on social media sites, and many were duped into believing that the account was true. But News Watch 33 “makes no guarantees” about the accuracy of its stories, according to its disclaimer . Contrary to these false reports, there have been no earbud electrocution deaths.

"Weight Loss Claims About Garcinia Cambogia-Fiction!","2015-07-02 18:24:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/weight-loss-claims-about-garcinia-cambogia/"," Many people have questioned whether ads for a weight loss supplement called Garcinia Cambogia are real. "," There’s no proof that Garcinia cambogia can help you lose weight without diet and exercise, so this one is fiction. Garcinia cambogia is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia. Dietary supplement companies regularly claim that it’s an appetite suppressant that also prevents the body from making fat. So, supposedly, the supplement can help you lose weight without diet or exercise. Garcinia cambogia got a major boost in November 2013 by “The Dr. Oz Show.” Dr. Oz said , “Thanks to brand new scientific research, I can tell you about a revolutionary fat buster. It’s called Garcinia cambogia.” As Dr. Oz delivered that intro, the words “No Exercise. No Diet. No Effort.” appeared on the screen behind him. Dr. Oz then interviewed a woman who said she lost 10 pounds thanks to Garcinia cambogia. But claims that Garcinia cambogia being a “miracle” dietary supplement have been disputed ever since. A 1998 study found that Garcinia cambogia didn’t help people lose weight. But a follow up analysis of numerous studies on any possible weight loss benefits concluded in 2013 that the supplement’s dietary benefits “remain to be proven.” A number of dietary supplement producers used the 2013 analysis to market Garcinia cambogia as a miracle supplement that could help people lose weight without diet or exercise — but those claims are unproven. A congressional panel later grilled Dr. Oz about his endorsement of unproven dietary supplements, and about his endorsement of Garcinia cambogia in particular, CNN reports: Oz testified Tuesday that he could not be held responsible for what certain companies say online about the products. He said he’s toned down some of his language and will publish a list of products he thinks really can help people lose weight. “To not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer,” Oz said in a prepared statement after the hearing. “In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future, I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams.” The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate weight loss supplements. Under current law, companies selling these products do not need FDA approval before marketing them to the public. It’s important to note that the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements . That means companies don’t have to back up claims about “miracle” weight loss supplements like Garcina cambogia. And, right now, there’s no proof that Garcinia cambogia has any affect on weight loss at all. ","Health - Medical"

"," It’s true that public warnings have been issued about potentially deadly bacteria at Florida beaches on the Gulf of Mexico, but it’s technically not a “flesh-eating” bacteria. Health officials in Florida issued a public warning in June 2015 after bacteria called Vibro vulnificus infected seven people and killed two: “People can get infected with Vibrio vulnificus when they eat raw shellfish,” Florida Health Department spokeswoman Mara Burger said. “Since it is naturally found in warm marine waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to Vibrio vulnificus through direct contact with seawater.” People with healthy immune systems who eat the bacteria with raw shellfish usually have mild symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. But when Vibro vulnificus enters the body through an open wound, it can be much, much worse, the CDC reports : “Infection with V. vulnificus is a serious health threat that predominantly affects persons with an underlying illness or a compromised immune system, and especially affects persons with liver disease. The organism is a natural inhabitant of warm coastal waters.” The bacteria can cause blood infections (which are fatal 50% of the time) and blistering skin lesions, which is why it’s called a flesh-eating bacteria. In extreme cases, the patient’s limbs have to be amputated to stop the spread of infection, according to the CDC . Public health warnings about the bacteria along Florida’s Gulf Coast aren’t uncommon, either. Warnings were issued in 2013 and 2014, and there were a combined 73 cases reported in those two years. However, public health officials note that Florida beaches receive millions of visitors each summer, so infections are very rare. Health experts have also taken issue with the term “flesh-eating bacteria.” A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said, via Clearwater Patch , “There is no such medical term (as flesh-eating bacteria) and the organism is not a Pac-man consuming pac-dots.” However, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says that necrotizing soft tissue infections are sometimes (informally) called flesh eating bacteria because that’s how they appear: “Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare but very severe type of bacterial infection. It can destroy the muscles, skin, and underlying tissue. The word ‘necrotizing’ refers to something that causes body tissue to die …The bacteria begins to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. As the tissue dies, the bacteria enters the blood and rapidly spreads throughout the body.” So, aside from debate over the definition of flesh-eating bacteria, this eRumor is true.

The bill prohibits any person from performing or inducing, or attempting to perform or induce, an abortion when the unborn child is considered to be capable of experiencing pain, unless the woman is undergoing a medical emergency.

"99-year-old David Rockefeller Undergoes Sixth Heart Transplant – Fiction!","2015-05-06 06:19:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/99-year-old-david-rockefeller-undergoes-sixth-heart-transplant/"," 99-year-old billionaire David Rockefeller has successfully undergone his sixth heart transplant surgery in the last 38 years. "," A fake news website started the false report that David Rockefeller has had six heart transplant surgeries. An article that appeared on the website World News Daily Report claimed that David Rockefeller, an heir to the billion-dollar Rockefeller estate, has had six heart transplants and two kidney transplants over the years: “His first heart transplant occurred in 1976 after a dramatic car accident led him to suffer a heart attack. He was operated 24 hours later and up and jogging a week later.” Within days, the fake news report was shared more than 130,000 times on social media. Many people believed that David Rockefeller had actually undergone his sixth heart transplant and argued about whether or not it was right for a rich, 100-year-old man to take a heart from a younger person in need. But those people missed World News Day Report’s disclaimer . It says that the website is not “responsible for inaccurate information” and assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles. This isn’t the first time that David Rockefeller’s health has been at the center of an online hoax, either. Just weeks earlier, a separate false report spread across social media that David Rockefeller had died: “At about 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday (April 28, 2015), our beloved business man David Rockefeller passed away. David Rockefeller was born on June 12, 1915 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.” The debate about wealthy people “cutting in line” to receive an organ transplant isn’t a new one. In 2009, Steve Jobs was criticized after he traveled to Tennessee for a liver transplant on short notice, ABC News reports : “Jobs couldn’t pay for an organ. Nor could he pay to cut the queue. But what someone with Jobs’ resources could do, according to liver transplant surgeons and ethicists, is to use money and mobility to improve the odds either by going to an area of the country where there are more organ donors, or by signing up at multiple transplant centers.” Dick Cheney drew similar criticism when he underwent a heart transplant in 2013.  Cheney had waited on a transplant list for 20 months before the surgery, but some argued that he was too old (71 at the time) to receive a donor’s heart. The United Network for Organ Sharing, the non-profit that maintains the nationwide patient waiting list, often considers a patient’s ability to pay for a transplant when deciding where to place an available organ.

"ISIS Hit with Fleshing-Eating Plague-Truth! But Misleading!","2015-04-25 11:43:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/isis-hit-with-fleshing-eating-plague/"," ISIS terrorists in Syria have been stricken with a flesh-eating plague. "," It’s true that hundreds of ISIS fighters in Raqqa, Syria, have been stricken with a flesh-eating virus called leishmaniasis. However, the impact the virus has had on ISIS appeared to be exaggerated in reports that referred to it as a “plague.” America’s science envoy to the Middle East said in January 2015 that there was a “perfect storm” for outbreaks of infectious disease in the areas of Syria and Iraq that were under ISIS control, the Independent reports : “Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading global health expert, said an outbreak of leishmaniasis, a disfiguring disease spread by sand flies, was already ‘out of control’ in Syria, and he also warned about the rising risk posed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in a region where many hospitals have closed and disease surveillance control measures are hampered by fighting.” There had been a total of 100,000 cases of the flesh-eating virus reported in Syria by April 2015. It wasn’t clear how many ISIS fighters were infected. Many of the ISIS fighters who were infected, however, refused medical treatment, which led to even more outbreaks, the Mirror reports : “It causes large open wounds which eat away at flesh, is fatal if not treated with a simple course of medicine. But the jihadi fighters are refusing medical treatment, which has led to more outbreaks. People in the Islamic State’s capital Raqqa, in war-torn Syria, are at the highest risk. Doctors from non-government organization (NGO) Medecins Sans Frontieres were initially trying to curb the outbreaks but have now left since Islamic State set up. And other medical centers have closed down after medical staff fled the violence. Local medics who have very little experience of treating the virus are left to deal with patients, which has led to it spreading extensively.” The impact of the flesh-eating virus on ISIS isn’t known, but the terrorist group’s activity toward the end of April 2015 indicated that it was far from being wiped out. ISIS was engaged in “intense clashes” with Kurdish fighters, Business Insider reports . Medical have professionals warned that the flesh-eating virus could become a widespread epidemic in Syria, but that hadn’t appeared to have happened when this eRumor went viral. ","Health - Medical"
"Children’s Tylenol, Motrin Have Been Recalled-Truth! But Outdated!","2015-04-23 15:23:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/childrens-tylenol-motrin-have-been-recalled/"," Social media posts claim that Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products for kids and infants have been recalled. "," These social media posts lead back to an article from 2010 about Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products for kids being recalled, so the eRumor is outdated. WebMD posted an advisory about the recall back in 2010. Five years later, many social media users linked to the 2010 article and warned parents to clean Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl out of their medicine cabinets. McNeil Consumer Healthcare Inc. announced the voluntary recall back in 2010 because some of its over-the-counter liquid products for children and infants did not meet minimum quality standards, the FDA reports : “McNeil Consumer Healthcare, Division of McNEIL-PPC, Inc., in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is voluntarily recalling all lots that have not yet expired of certain over-the-counter (OTC) Children’s and Infants’ liquid products manufactured in the United States and distributed in the United States, Canada, Dominican Republic, Dubai (UAE), Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad & Tobago, and Kuwait. “McNeil Consumer Healthcare is initiating this voluntary recall because some of these products may not meet required quality standards. This recall is not being undertaken on the basis of adverse medical events. However, as a precautionary measure, parents and caregivers should not administer these products to their children. Some of the products included in the recall may contain a higher concentration of active ingredient than is specified; others may contain inactive ingredients that may not meet internal testing requirements; and others may contain tiny particles. While the potential for serious medical events is remote, the company advises consumers who have purchased these recalled products to discontinue use.” False alarm about the 2010 recall resurfaced in 2015 after McNeil Consumer Healthcare agreed to settle a lawsuit over the recall. The company agreed to a $25 million settlement because metal particles got into bottles of Children’s Tylenol and Children’s Motrin, the Associated Press reports : “Court documents say metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process. Prosecutors said McNeil failed to take immediate steps to fix the problem.” The FDA confirmed that the old recall had reappeared in the news and warned consumers to visit www.fda.gov for current information on product recalls.

"New Stroke Indicator Can Help Save Lives – Fiction!","2015-04-15 11:27:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/new-stroke-indicator-can-help-save-lives/"," A viral email claims that pricking a stroke victim’s fingers with a needle can indicate whether or not they are having a stroke and can reverse the effects of a stroke. "," Claims made in this email about new indicators for strokes are false, and following the instructions could jeopardize a stroke victim’s life. The email, which first circulated in 2006, says to prick the fingers of a person who may be having a stroke with a needle until they regain consciousness. If they don’t come to after several minutes, the email suggests pulling on their ears and poking each ear lobe with a needle: “After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness. Wait till the victim regains his normal state without any abnormal symptoms then take him to the hospital. Otherwise, if he was taken in the ambulance in a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in his brain to burst. If he could save his life, barely managing to walk, then it is by the grace of his ancestors.” Dr. Steven Novella debunked the claims in a blog post that said, “Pricking the fingers or earlobes would cause (thankfully) a negligible amount of bleeding and would not in any way affect the stroke victim’s hemodynamics. And if it did, that would just worsen the stroke by decreasing brain perfusion and oxygen delivery.” Pricking the fingertips of a stroke victim and waiting for them to regain consciousness, as the eRumor suggests, would also delay critical medical attention. Dr. Barbara Goodwin, of the Cayuga Medical Center, said : “There is a saying in the medical community that ‘time is brain’ when it comes to treating stroke because the longer the brain is without sufficient oxygen, the more damaging a stroke will be. Immediate recognition of stroke symptoms and transportation to the emergency department within two hours of the onset of symptoms can make a tremendous difference for someone who has suffered a stroke. “…The easiest way to remember the symptoms of stroke is to use the acronym ‘FAST,’ which stands for face, arms, speech and time. Look at the person’s face, look for weakness on one side of the body, especially the arms, and ask him or her to speak to you. Then act quickly to seek emergency medical attention.” The eRumor also says a stroke victim should be taken to the hospital after they regain consciousness, which is awful advice. Dr. Goodwin says that it’s important for stroke victims to remain lying down, preferably on their side, while they wait for an ambulance to arrive.

"Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) Emit Radiation, Contain Mercury-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-31 23:15:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/compact-fluorescent-light-bulbs-cfls-emit-radiation-contain-mercury/"," Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are radioactive and add more toxicity to the environment than regular light bulbs because they contain mercury. "," This one is true, false and misleading all at once. There is truth in claims that CFLs give off ultraviolet (UV) radiation and contain mercury, but studies show that those concerns have been exaggerated. The debate over CFLs started in 2007 after President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act into law. The bill required screw-based light blubs to use fewer watts for similar brightness by 2014 to save energy. The bill also requires most light bulbs to be 60-70% more efficient than regular incandescent light bulbs by 2020. Many have interpreted the law to mean that consumers must use CFLs, but that isn’t the case. The law doesn’t restrict the types of light bulbs that can be sold, just the amount of energy they use. Right now, CFLs and LEDs meet the 2020 energy requirement, according to the bill . But that doesn’t mean more options won’t be available by 2020. Claims that CFLs are radioactive and toxic have been around since Congress introduced the bill. A page posted on the website Live Leak provides one example: “Consider this – instead of saving the environment, CFLs are actually destroying it. CFLs should be thought of as toxic technology, when mercury contamination, ultraviolet radiation, and radio frequency radiation are factored in. From cradle to grave, CFLs pose a danger to people’s health and well being, as well as adding even more toxicity to the environment. In fact, CFLs do not reduce a person’s carbon footprint and may even increase it in some situations. To make matters even worse, CFLs emit harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation. “ Let’s take a look at each of these claims. First, it’s true that CFLs emit ultra-violet (UV) radiation. Researchers at Stony Brook University found that UV leaked from cracks in the phosphor coatings on CFLs. Their study found that CFLs should not be used at close distances and should be placed behind glass covers. The UV radiation was on par with what is given off by standard fluorescent lights, so the risk for skin damage is not great. There is also a small amount of mercury in CFLs, as the eRumor claims. If a bulb breaks, there is some risk of mercury exposure, but, again, it’s not great, the National Institutes of Health reports : “’The amount of mercury gas coming off (broken CFLs) is over a milligram over a few days. If you put that milligram into a poorly ventilated room, the concentration can be over the recommended limit for children,” says Robert Hurt, the director of the Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation. ‘The overall risk is low, but it’s not zero risk, and there is definitely an opportunity to do better.’ “…Hurt’s research suggests that the peak for escaping mercury vapor lasts a few hours. The group also found that plastic bags leaked mercury vapor. ‘This new information may allow for modeling of airborne mercury concentrations following breakage, thus providing the capability to more fully assess the effectiveness of cleanup,’ says Roxanne Smith, a press officer for the EPA.” The EPA’s tips for cleaning up broken CFLs can be found here . Finally, the claim that CFLs add more toxicity to the environment than regular bulbs because of their mercury content is false. CFLs actually reduce the amount of mercury entering the environment because less energy is required to use them. That means less mercury-emitting coal needs to be burned, the National Institutes of Health reports . ","Health - Medical"
"Lawsuit Claims California Wines Have Unsafe Amounts of Arsenic – Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-23 17:36:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lawsuit-claims-california-wines-have-unsafe-amounts-of-arsenic/"," A lawsuit claims that some brands of California wine have dangerously high levels of arsenic. "," It’s true that a number of California wineries were sued for high levels of arsenic in their wines, but the lawsuit is misleading. The class action lawsuit claims that 28 California wineries bottled wine that had unsafe levels of inorganic arsenic. It said there was 500% more arsenic in some wine samples than is allowed in drinking water: “Defendants produce, manufacture and/or distribute wine in California that contains inorganic arsenic in amounts far in excess of what is allowed in drinking water. Defendants do not warn that their products contain unsafe amounts of inorganic arsenic, nor do they disclose even the existence of inorganic arsenic in the wine.” The problem is that it’s misleading to compare the allowable arsenic levels of drinking water and wine. The EPA allows arsenic levels to reach 10 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water — but there aren’t any specific limits on allowable arsenic levels in wine. Even so, that doesn’t mean that arsenic levels in California wines are unsafe or toxic. Other countries allow much more arsenic in wine than the EPA allows in drinking water. The International Organization of Vine and Wine, which regulates wine makers in 45 countries, sets the limit for total arsenic in wine at 200 ppb. In Canada and the European Union, the limit is 100 ppb. Besides, the lawsuit doesn’t attack the California wine makers for dangerous amounts of arsenic. It claims the companies broke state laws because they didn’t disclose that there was any arsenic at all in their wines on the labels. That basically means that every California winery would have to make the same disclosure, because arsenic is in almost all food and drinks. The Wine Institute, which represents 1,000 California wineries, called the lawsuit “irresponsible” in a statement : “Arsenic is prevalent in the natural environment in air, soil and water, and in food. As an agricultural product, wines from throughout the world contain trace amounts of arsenic, as do juices, vegetables, grains and other alcohol beverages. There is no research that shows that the amounts found in wine pose a health risk to consumers. “The U.S. Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the agency that regulates wine, beer and spirits, monitors wines for compounds, including arsenic, as part of its testing program as does FDA as part of its Total Diet Study. While there are no established limits in the U.S., several countries, including the European Union, have established limits of 100 parts per billion or higher for wine. California wine exports are tested by these governments and are below the established limits.” Whether or not the federal government should set limits for the amount of arsenic allowed in wine is open for debate. But even if it does, the level won’t be the same as drinking water’s, which is what the eRumor seems to imply. ","Health - Medical"

Under the old rules prior to Obamacare consumers could use funds in their HSA or other health insurance tax free savings accounts to purchase medication such as aspirin or allergy drugs.  According to the HSA Resources website funds from HSA may be used to pay for qualified medical expense, such as  ambulance costs, artificial limbs, birth control pills,contact lenses, lab fees,  and prescriptions. Employer healthcare insurance contributions on the 2011 W-2 form will be added to the employee’s gross income- Fiction! The amount entered for employer contributions to the health insurance plans on the W-2 form are for evidence that the employee has health insurance coverage.  This amount will not be taxable nor added to the employee’s gross income. In an April 5, 2010 article called “Health Care Reform: 13 Tax Changes on the Way” , Senior Tax Editor, Joan Pryde of the Washington D.C. based Kiplinger Letters wrote about a “requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income.” “The Mark of the Beast” in the Healthcare Bill- Fiction! A new eRumor began circulating in early April 2010 that claims that the new healthcare reform bill includes requirements for every American to have microchips implanted in their bodies that would contain medical and other encoded personal information.  The email message says it may be a form of the “Mark of the Beast” indicated in the Bible as one of the signs of the end of the world.  It is not true. It refers to what is called in the health care legislation the “National Medical Device Registry.”  The registry does exist in the bill but has nothing to do with requiring implanted microchips in American citizens.  It proposes a national database of medical devices that have already been put into people’s bodies such as artificial knees, artificial hips, heart stents, pacemakers, etc.  The purpose of the registry is to track the effectiveness and performance of the devices. Whoever originated this eRumor took the wording from the bill about the medical device registry and added their own interpretation that it involved microchips and would apply to every person. Individuals and families can opt out of the health care system if they belong to a religious organization that has a health care sharing ministry- Truth! Members of some religious organizations may claim a Religious Conscience Exemption if their sects meet the conditions by having a health care sharing ministry that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). Members of the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientists),  might not object to medical care purchasing health insurance.  The church’s official websites says that it teaches members that they “are always free to choose medical treatment, which many individuals feel is the most obvious solution to health difficulties.”  Members might be free to enroll in the health care plan or opt out of it. Amish do not believe an accepting assistance from the government but according to the frequently asked questions section on the Amish.net web site , members of the sect use local doctors, and if they have a medical condition that requires them to do so,  they will seek the help of medical specialists or go to hospitals.  The Amish subscribe to health plans or purchase medical insurance and if they are sick, will treat the ailments at home first. Such individuals and families will not be subject to the 2.5% tax.  This is outlined on pages 326-328 discuss religious conscience exemptions: ‘‘(2) RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS.— ‘‘(A) RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof described in section 1402(g)(1) and an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section. ‘‘(B) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.— ‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual is a member of a health care sharing ministry for the month. ‘‘(ii) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.—The term ‘health care sharing ministry’ means an organization— ‘‘(I) which is described in section 501(c)(3) and is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), ‘‘(II) members of which share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs and without regard to the State in which a member resides or is employed, ‘‘(III) members of which retain membership even after they develop a medical condition, ‘‘(IV) which (or a predecessor of which) has been in existence at all1 times since December 31, 1999, and medical expenses of its members have been shared continuously and without interruption since at least December 31, 1999, and ‘‘(V) which conducts an annual audit which is performed by an independent certified public accounting firm in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and which is made available to the public upon request. A word about forwarded emails that reference pages from the Affordable Healthcare Act: One of the most common errors concerning the Affordable Healthcare Act that is circulating on the Internet is when the messages reference page numbers to the older versions of the bill.  Text and page numbers from HR-3200 is often found in messages, video and graphics that have gone viral on the World Wide Web or social network cites such as Facebook.   Computer users should exercise discernment before passing them on.

HR-3200 eRumors: There are many questions being raised about President Obama’s new proposed health care bill and we will try to answer them.    The bill was introduced to Congress as the “America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009” or  H.R. 3200 on July 14, 2009.  The Bill was sponsored by Representative  John D. Dingell of the15th district of Michigan.  According to the Thomas Library of Congress the bill was “referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means, Education and Labor, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Budget, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.” As  of July 28, 2009, The Thomas Library reports, “Latest Major Action: 7/21/2009 House committee/subcommittee actions.

Mandatory end of life counseling every five years to instruct patients how to determine ways to end suffering- Truth! & Fiction! To be excluded by the Senate! On August 13, 2009 the Associated Press reported that, “Key senators are excluding a provision on end-of-life care from health overhaul legislation after language in a House bill caused a furor.” Click for article Betsy McCaughey, a former New York Lt. Governor and conservative health activist, was interviewed on July 16, 2009 on the of former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson. In the interview she stated that page 425 of the health care bill said that everyone on Social Security & Medicare would have to undergo mandatory counseling every five years to determine ways to end their suffering. The counseling would be more frequent in the case of a terminal illness. McCaughhey’s comments dovetailed with several statements from critics of the health care legislation who claimed that the same portion of the bill could be used to promote euthanasia.  House minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter said that such concerns were valid.  They are quoted by LifeNews.com as saying, that the measure “could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia, mercy-killing, and physican-assisted suicide because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself.” The Vice President of AARP, John Rother, disagrees. He said the bill does not, in his view, create a problem of euthanasia. He said that under the bill, Medicare would be required to cover the consultations for the first time but does not mandate that people get end-of-life consultation. He said that any consultation would be with the patient, the doctor or nurse practitioner—not a government bureaucrat. Pages 424 to 434 in the proposed healthcare bill discusses Advance Care Planning and the mandatory consultation is to discuss end of life services such as hospice care and living wills. Click for Fred Thompson interview. Another eRumor originated by the American Family Association warns of Rationing and Euthanasia – Disputed! and Fiction! Don Wildmon of the American Family Association (eRumor example #3) warned that Health Care Bill this could be the next next step towards euthanasia.   Assisted suicide and euthanasia are not mentioned in the text of the bill and differ greatly from hospice care.   Both private medical insurance policies and the proposed Universal Health Care plan have set limitations of coverage and deductibles could be be defined as the “rationing” of benefits. Another eRumor includes a long list of concerns from the organization Family Security Matters. (eRumor Example #2) Pg 22 of the HC Bill mandates the Government will audit books of all employers that self insure. – A Matter of Interpretation! The text of the bill reads, “The Commissioner, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor Secretary of Labor, shall conduct a study of the large group insured and self-insured employer health care markets.”  There is no mention of  audits. Pg 30 Sec 123 of HC bill — a Government committee (good luck with that!) will decide what treatments/benefits a person may receive. – Fiction! The text of the bill reads” IN GENERAL.—There is established a private-public advisory committee which shall be a panel of medical and other experts to be known as the Health Benefits Advisory Committee to recommend covered benefits and essential, enhanced, and premium plans.”  There is no mention of treatment procedures or policies. Pg 29 lines 4-16 in the HC bill — YOUR HEALTHCARE WILL BE RATIONED! (they call it allocated) – Disputed! Rationing could be defined as the controlled distribution of resources and goods or services. This section of the bill deal with cost sharing and co-payments and annual limitations,  The text of the bill says, “The cost-sharing incurred under the essential benefits package with respect to an individual (or family) for a year does not exceed the applicable level specified in subparagraph.”   It is then defined as $5,000 per individual and $10,000 per family each year. The setting of co-payments and coverage limitations is a standard procedure for all medical health plans. Pg 42 of HC Bill — The Health Choices Commissioner will choose your HC Benefits for you.  – Truth! According to the text of the bill, the commissioner’s duties include the establishment and enforcement of “qualified health benefits plan standards”.  The list of his duties also includes the “establishment and operation of a Health Insurance Exchange” and accountability. PG 50 Section 152 in HC bill — HC will be provided to ALL non US citizens, illegal or otherwise. – Disputed! There is no provision to check for citizenship prior to receiving health services even though there are the provisions:. Section 152 is a discrimination clause that basically said that all health services “covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.”   Citizenship is not mentioned. Section 246 on page 143 under the heading of  “NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS” said, “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.” Pg 58 HC Bill — Government will have real-time access to individual’s finances and a National ID Health Card will be issued!- Truth !  and Fiction! Under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS”, this section is for a “real-time (or near realtime) determination of an individual’s financial responsibility at the point of service and, to the extent possible, prior to service, including whether the individual is eligible for a specific service with a specific physician at a specific facility, which may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identification card”   Co-payments which need to be collected are part of the plan and it also appears that the new health plan is designed to work with insurance supplement programs.  There is no mention in the bill that personal finance records would be collected. Pg 59 HC Bill lines 21-24 Government will have direct access to your bank accts for election funds transfer. – A Matter of Interpretation! This falls under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS” the bill says,”enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.”   The text of the bill is not clear if the electronic funds transfers means between the patient and the health care provider. PG 65 Sec 164 is a payoff subsidized plan for retirees and their families in Unions & community organizations (read: ACORN).- Fiction! Section 164 deals with “REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES” and says, “Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a temporary reinsurance program (in this section referred to as the ‘‘reinsurance program’’) to provide reimbursement to assist participating employment-based plans with the cost of providing health benefits to retirees and to eligible spouses, surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees.”    Unions and community organizations (such as ACORN) do not appear to be singled out in the text of the bill.   Also, non union private business that offer retirement plans and benefits for employees exist in the country. Pg 72 Lines 8-14 Government will create an HC Exchange to bring private HC plans under Government control. Was under investigation at the time the bill was abandoned PG 91 Lines 4-7 HC Bill — Government mandates linguistic appropriate services. Example — Translators for illegal aliens. – Truth! & Fiction! The text of the bill read, “CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS.—The entity shall provide for culturally and linguistically appropriate communication and health services.”   Translations Services will be provided for those who do not speak English.   Section 246 on page 143 under the heading of  “NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS” said, “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.”  This means no benefits provided to illegal aliens.

"Cancer can be caused by foods in plastics and that’s how Sheryl Crow gotcancer-Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dioxins/"," There are a several versions of this eRumor. The first to appear on the Internet was a message that says a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from the Castle Hospital (no location mentioned) appeared on television and said plastic containers should not be used for heating foods in a microwave oven. He said this is especially true if the foods contain fat. The message claims that the combination of fats and plastics will release dioxins into the food and into the cells of the body with a risk of cancer. The doctor recommended using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers instead in order to avoid the dioxin. Prepared foods such as TV dinners should be taken out of plastic containers before heating. The second version tells the story of a seventh-grade student who decided to do some experiments with microwave radiation on food wrapped in plastic. She is said to have enlisted the help of the National Center for “Toxicological”  Research in Arkansas.  The student allegedly found that not only are there carcinogens migrating from the plastic into food during microwaving, but other substances as well. This eRumor also lists an article about Dr. Edward Fujimoto saying that he appeared on a TV station in Huntsville, Alabama. Another version claims all this was in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center. Yet another version says that singer Sheryl Crow, who is suffering from breast cancer, got her cancer from drinking from plastic water bottles left in the sun and that got too hot and, as a result, were contaminated with dioxins. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find any research that supports the fear that food can become contaminated with dioxins either from plastic wrap or plastic in microwave ovens. It’s an understandable concern because dioxins are among the most poisonous chemical group known and steps have been taken by many world governments to reduce the amounts of dioxins in the environment. Dr. Edward Fujimoto is real and is the Manager of the Wellness and Lifestyle Medicine Department at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii. (not Alabama).  Part of this eRumor is the result of an interview he did on KHON-TV channel 2 in Hawaii on January 23, 2002. TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Fujimoto who said the eRumor quoted him fairly accurately.  His concern was whether a combination of ingredients, especially plastics and food fats, could result in food being contaminated by dioxins when heated in a microwave. That is his observation and he claims to have research substantiating it. TruthOrFiction.com has twice asked for him to give us that research but has never received it.  He said that he is surprised about how little Americans know about dioxins in everyday life because in Japan, the majority of the population knows about them and the country has enacted regulations to protect its people.  He explained that in his view, heating food in a plastic container will produce the release of dioxins and fat will absorb them. The amount of migration of dioxins to fat, he said, will be a function of the heat in the microwave, the type of plastic, the length of time of exposure, and the amount of fat that is in contact.  Dr. Fujimoto pointed out that the amounts of dioxins in any given piece of plastic or food that is microwaved in plastic is very small, but that the problem is that dioxins get into the human body and accumulate. He sad that in Japan, there has been a complete change in the way foods are packaged so that plastic is avoided. They use more glass, for example. In early 2004, a corrupted version of the eRumor started circulating that made it appear as though Dr. Fujimoto was also concerned about putting water in plastic bottles and freezing it, but he never addressed that.  This version of the eRumor also made it sound as though the plastic itself was the problem, not the plastic in combination with food and heat.  It says, for example, that the heat causes dioxin (sic) to “drip from the plastic” into the food but none of the researchers has claimed that. A variation of the bottled water version said that was how singer Sheryl Crow got cancer, by drinking bottled water and that she appeared on the Ellen show or the Oprah show to tell the story. Crow has been treated for breast cancer but she’s never blamed it on bottled water. Another version of eRumor about the seventh-grader has been a little more difficult to detail.  We’ve confirmed that there is a Dr. Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxilogical Research who, along with a Claire V. Nelson, published a paper at a professional event in Orlando, Florida in 1998 and it was on the subject of food contamination from plastic wrap.   We’ve not found the actual study, however, and have never received a response from Dr. Wilkes. The eRumor about Jon Wilkes and Claire Nelson appears to have come from the Options Newsletter published by People Against Cancer at www.peopleagainstcancer.com . The folks who make Saran Wrap have responded to the eRumor.  A statement by the SC Johnson company says the “plasticizer” in Saran Wrap is derivative of naturally occurring citric acid found in citrus fruits and is 100% dioxin free.  The statement further adds that dioxins can only be formed with chlorine is combined with the kinds of high temperatures associated with waste incinerators, temperatures like 1,500 degrees F. Even the most powerful microwaves are not capable of those temperatures, according to the company. SC Johnson says none of its products contains dioxins. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dioxins are both natural and man-made.  The man-made dioxins are released into the air from sources like waste incineration, from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil), and certain types of chemical processing.  Almost every person has been exposed to low levels of dioxins and the EPA says there is research that suggests that high levels of dioxins may be correlated with various health problems, although some of that is extrapolated from studies of animals, not humans. The only reference we could find about dioxins and microwaves was from an FDA publication that was concerned about dioxins resulting from the bleached manufacture of paper goods including milk cartons and some paper containers for microwave dinners.  That was not about plastics and high temperatures, however, and the levels of dioxins were described as safe. The Food and Safety Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has published guidelines for safe cooking in microwave ovens and warns against using materials that are not regarded as microwave safe. CLICK HERE for those guidelines.  You’ll note that one of the guidelines is to avoid letting plastic wraps touch food.  That is another issue, however, and not related to dioxins or high heat in microwaves. The Food and Drug Administration has also issued a statement about plastics and microwaves.v CLICK HERE for that document. The American Plastics Council has also posted a page on the subject. CLICK HERE for their take on the dioxin question. Somewhere along the way someone decided to add that all this information had appeared in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center but neither has promoted the dioxin story. Even though Johns Hopkins has not been the source of the eRumor, there have been enough emails that falsely attributed the story to them that the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health asked Dr. Rolf Halden, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Services at the school’s Center for Water and Health to address the concerns over dioxins. He said that the principal sources of dioxins are from various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and volcanic eruptions.  Plastics do not actually contain dioxins, he said, but wastes that contain certain compounds can serve as dioxin precursors when incinerated. According to Halden, most people are exposed to dioxins when eating meat and fish rich in fat because dioxins that have been sent into the atmosphere become attached to particles that fall back to the earth and get concentrated and store in the fat of fish and other animals. Halden said that the alleged danger or freezing water in plastic bottles is unfounded and an urban legend.  First, because there are no dioxins in plastics.  Second because freezing actually inhibits the release of chemicals.  He said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water in the bottles, not the bottles themselves.  He added that there is another group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle that could disrupt endocrine functions in humans and animals and that heating up the plastics could increase their being released into water and food. Regarding cooking with plastics, Halden said that whenever you heat something it increases the likelihood that chemicals could be pulled out.  he recommends using heat-resistant glass or ceramics for microwave cooking, just to be safe.

"Injuries on children caused by cleaning “erasers”-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cleaningproducts/"," There are apparently different versions of this but they all warn that children can experience injuries on the skin from the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser or the Mr Clean Magic Eraser. One of the eRumors says that Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is being removed from store shelves because of containing formaldehyde. "," The bottom line is that there is a first-hand story of a child who experienced skin irritation from a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser but there is dispute about whether it was from chemicals or the abrasive action of the product from being rubbed on the skin. The story about Mr. Clean Magic Eraser being removed from the market is not true. Procter & Gamble Mr Clean Magic Eraser The eRumor claims that the Magic Eraser contains formaldehyde. If you review the government-required Material Safety Data Sheet, you see that one of the ingredients is “Formaldehyde-Melamine-Sodium Bisulfite Copolymer.”  That’s the name of the entire ingredient and it’s different than if the product had formaldehyde alone, according to Procter & Gamble. A company release said that “…the word ‘formaldehyde’ is in its chemical name. However, this ingredient is not formaldehyde and poses no health or safety risks. (Think of this name like ‘sodium chloride’, which is table salt. Sodium by itself can be dangerous, but sodium chloride – salt – is safe.).”  The company said that any formaldehyde found on its product would be in tiny amounts and a result of the manufacturing process and would be “actually less than what is found in indoor air.” Procter & Gamble denies that there is any danger from the product and adds “In fact, no ingredients in Magic Eraser are subject to any health-related labeling laws in North America or in the European Union.” ScotchBrite Easy Eraser The text of the eRumor about a mother’s experience with the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser is authentic.  It’s a first-hand account from the woman who runs a website named Kerflop .  Don’t know if that’s her last name but her first name is Jessica and the text of the eRumor is posted on her site.  The incident took place in 2006. She describes how her son (picture below) got “large, shiny, blistering red marks… across his cheeks and chin” from apparently rubbing a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser on his face.  She got advice over the phone from a poison center, which told her that products like the Easy Eraser and Magic Eraser “…have a pH of 8 – 10 and can cause chemical burns.”  They gave her first-aid instructions.  She then took her son to a hospital for treatment.  It is her contention that the product contained “a harmful alkaline or “base” chemical (opposite of acid on the pH scale) that can burn your skin.”  She describes his injuries as “chemical burns.” We have not found any experts who would agree with the comment from the poison control center that a pH of 8 – 10 can cause chemical burns.”  The pH scale measures the range of acidity on one hand and alkalinity on the other.  The scale ranges from 0 to 14. At the 0 end is solutions that are very acidic.  Lemon juice is about a 2, vinegar is around 3,. Pure water has a neutral pH of 7, which is and some soaps range up to a pH of 9. Although her story is about ScotchBrite’s Easy Eraser, she makes reference to the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser as well and notes that the original packaging of each did not include any warnings of harm from their use on the skin. The 3M company’s Material Safety Data Sheet shows that the product is made of polyurethane foam and melamine foam.  No other chemicals are listed. The sheet does indicate that there can be “mechanical abrasion” and Kerflop says that in January she got a note from 3M that said: “We have addressed the issue and are taking steps to change the packaging to warn other consumers of the potential reaction to using the product on the skin.” Updated 7/25/07 ","Health - Medical"

We’ll go through the email one fact at time but it needs to be kept in mind that not every Margarine product is the same.  There are other spreads that are loosely called Margarine but may, for example, be part vegetable oil or a fat-free Margarine product. 1. Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys. When it killed The turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a Payback so they put their heads together to figure out what to do with this Product to get their money back. It was a white substance with no food Appeal so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in Place of butter. How do you like it? They have come out with some clever New flavorings- Fiction! According to the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers, Margarine was the idea of a Frenchman named Hippolyte Mege-Mouriez in response to a request from Emperor Louis Napoleon for ideas for a substitute for butter.  In 1869 he used margaric acid and the name of his formulation became known as Margarine. It became a hit in the United States in the late 1800’s. 2.  Both have the same amount of calories- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 100 calories.  A tablespoon of Margarine is 100 calories. 3.  Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study- Truth! But Updated! We didn’t find the “53%” study, but Harvard School of Public Health has published a report on this.  It says that more than 30 years ago research indicated that saturated fat (such as in butter) was bad for the heart and people were told to switch to margarine.  A Harvard study of women between 1980 and 1994 found a significant reduction of heart disease risk by reducing smoking, hormone treatment, and dietary improvements including reducing or eliminating saturated fat (such as in butter.)  Further research has shown, however, that some margarines contained trans fat, which was even worse for the heart than saturated fat.  The report cautions us not to make decisions as a result of just one study but to consider the body of recent research about an issue like butter versus margarine. 4. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 Grams- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 7g of saturated fat.  A tablespoon of margarine is 2g of saturated fat. 5.  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other Foods- Unproven! We could not find anything definitive about this. 6.   Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! It depends on what you are measuring.  The advantage of butter is that it is a more natural product than margarine and does have more vitamin content.  But butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk.  Saturated fats are the ones that are solid at room temperature and increase the “bad” cholesterol (LDL) as well as the “good” cholesterol (HDL).  The disadvantage of true margarine is the trans fat level.  The more solid a margarine is at room temperature, the more trans fat it contains, as much as 3 grams per tablespoon.  Margarine makers have responded to that by releasing tub or liquid products that have either reduced or eliminated trans fats.  Watch for the labels.  Heart doctors recommend butter over normal margarine but recommend trans fat free margarines over butter.  It all gets very confusing.  There are even margarine products now that say they actually lower cholesterol. 7. Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods- A Matter of Personal Taste! 8. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for Less than 100 years- Fiction! Margarine was introduced as an inexpensive alternative in France in 1869, according to a history found in the Margarine and Spreads Association in the United Kingdom. 9.   Margarine is high in trans fatty acids- Truth! 10.  Margarine triples the risk of coronary heart disease- Unproven! Although trans fats are to be avoided, we did not find any research that says that the use of margarine triples the risk of heart disease. 11. Margarine ncreases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)- Truth! 12. Increases the risk of cancers up to five fold- Fiction! We could not find any substantiation of this claim. 13. Margarine lowers quality of breast milk- Truth! We didn’t find any research on this but there are studies on how a mother’s eating of trans fats affects the level of trans fats in her milk. One study, for example, comparing Canadian breast milk to Chinese breast milk found that Canadian mothers had 33 more trans fats in their milk than the Chinese mothers.  So the quality of the breast milk can be affected by the consumption of trans fats. 14.  Margarine decreases immune response- Truth! We found several references to this including an article by nutritionist Dr. Mary Enig that said that consuming trans fatty acids “Affects immune response by lowering effeciency of B cell response and increasing proliferation of T cells.” 15. Decreases insulin response- Truth! Actually the trans fat can increase blood insulin levels, which increases the risk for diabetes. 16.  Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC- Fiction! We found no support for this.  Perhaps whoever wrote this heard a discussion about the “plasticity” of margarine.  It is “plastic” at room temperature meaning that the shape of it can be changed when pressure is applied.  That doesn’t mean it is composed of what we normally think of as plastic. It was originally made of animal fats but increasingly now is made from vegetable oils. Updated 3/29/07 ","Health - Medical"
"CDC Apologizes for Ineffective Flu Vaccines-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cdc-apologizes-for-ineffective-flu-vaccines/"," CDC officials issued a formal apology after it was discovered that the 2014 flu vaccine proved ineffective against a common strain of the flu virus. "," The CDC warned that 2014 could bring a “potentially severe” flu season, but it never apologized for developing an ineffective flu vaccine. The eRumor misconstrued a statement about the upcoming flu season that was released by the CDC on December 4, 2014: “Early data suggests that the current 2014-2015 flu season could be severe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges immediate vaccination for anyone still unvaccinated this season and recommends prompt treatment with antiviral drugs for people at high risk of complications who develop flu. “So far this year, seasonal influenza A H3N2 viruses have been most common. There often are more severe flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths during seasons when these viruses predominate. For example, H3N2 viruses were predominant during the 2012-2013, 2007-2008, and 2003-2004 seasons, the three seasons with the highest mortality levels in the past decade. All were characterized as ‘moderately severe.’” Each year, flu vaccines are designed to protect against four different flu viruses, and H3N2 is among them. Early on in the 2014 flu season, the CDC said it had discovered that roughly half of the H3N2 strains it analyzed were “drift variants”: “This means the vaccine’s ability to protect against those viruses may be reduced, although vaccinated people may have a milder illness if they do become infected. During the 2007-2008 flu season, the predominant H3N2 virus was a drift variant, yet the vaccine had an overall efficacy of 37 percent and 42 percent against H3N2 viruses.” In an average year, vaccines successfully ward off the flu about 60 percent of the time. However, the benefits of vaccination have an even larger impact on local communities, the website Science Based Medicine reports : “It is important to remember that with infectious diseases you are vaccinating not only individuals, but populations. When you get a vaccine you may also be protecting others from disease, and the effects of herd immunity are evident when you look at the effects of vaccination on the health of populations.” And the eRumor’s claim that the CDC “apologized” for the vaccine doesn’t check out in light of the CDC’s role in developing the vaccine. More than 140 influenza centers in 111 countries monitor influenza trends at all times. Those centers forward their findings to the five World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza, which includes the CDC, according to the agency : “The influenza viruses in the seasonal flu vaccine are selected each year based on surveillance-based forecasts about what viruses are most likely to cause illness in the coming season. WHO recommends specific vaccine viruses for inclusion in influenza vaccines, but then each individual country makes their own decision for which strains should be included in influenza vaccines licensed in their country. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines which vaccine viruses will be used in U.S.-licensed vaccines.” After the CDC issued its statement about H3N2, the eRumor began with a YouTube video posted by NextNewsNetwork: “For the first time we can remember, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are going on the record, saying the flu vaccine won’t work this year. The warning comes just before the busiest part of flu season, in January and February. Unfortunately, there won’t be any refund for any of the patients or insurance companies who spent money on flu shots earlier this fall.” However, the CDC didn’t issue an apology or “admit” that the 2014 flu vaccine wouldn’t work. The agency issued a warning about the severity of flu viruses in seasons when H3N2 is the most common strain, and it acknowledged that drift variants of H3N2 could reduce the vaccine’s effectiveness in the flu season ahead. The CDC suggests that everyone who is older than six months receive a flu vaccine every season. ","Health - Medical"
"CA-125 Cancer test is the best way to screen for Ovarian cancer-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ca-125/",".gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;} (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The “CA-125” Cancer Screening Test Is The Best Way To Detect Ovarian Cancer – Fiction! Summary eRumor: This is the   first-hand account of a woman who says she was eventually diagnosed   with ovarian cancer, but laments that she wasn’t given a   “CA-125” medical test earlier than when she got it.    She urges women to get the test annually and equates it with a   common screening test in men for prostate cancer. "," Anyone who has had treatment for ovarian cancer knows what an important role the CA-125 test can play, but TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed numerous professional documents regarding the CA-125 test and has not found a single one that recommends it alone as the primary screening tool for ovarian cancer. CA-125 is a substance found in the blood of some women with ovarian cancer.  According to the American Cancer Society, however, a CA-125 test is not a reliable tool for finding ovarian cancer because of its poor accuracy.   There is a large number of false negatives because some ovarian cancers do not raise CA-125 levels and some false positives because other conditions can sometimes raise CA-125 levels. Partly in response to the email eRumor, a statement was issued by a medical panel at a conference of the National Institutes of Health in April of 1994 that said the CA-125 test “…alone is not an adequate screening test.” The Louis Busch Hagar Cancer Center of Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown, New York, says that more than 50 percent of the women with ovarian cancer will not show results on a CA-125 test and a statement by the center calls the test a “disappointment.” It is regarded as a valuable tool, however, when sometimes combined with other tests or in targeted groups of women, such as those who have already gone through menopause.   Also, a study in the February 16, 1999 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine and cited by the American Cancer Society found that the CA-125 test was a valuable in tracking the progress of one of the most common forms of ovarian cancer, but that was after the cancer had already been found and was being treated.  The same article says the CA-125 test does not meet the standards of a screening test. According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer and fifth most common cause of cancer death among women and accounts for four percent of all cancers in women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. There is no question that early detection should be every woman’s goal and that she should work with her physician to that end .

"Blood Oranges from Libya Were Injected with HIV Blood-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/blood-oranges-from-libya-were-injected-with-hiv-blood/"," Algerian immigration services discovered that oranges from Libya had been injected with blood that tested positive for HIV or AIDS. A similar version of the eRumor reports that canned fruit from Thailand was found to be contaminated with HIV-positive blood. "," Various reports of HIV-positive blood being found in oranges and canned fruit have persisted for years, but there’s no truth to these claims. Even if these accounts were true, it would be nearly impossible to contract HIV from eating an orange that was injected with infected blood before it was shipped over a long distance. HIV is a living virus, and it needs a human host to survive, the non-profit group Aid for AIDS reports : “HIV is a very fragile virus outside of the body. The HIV virus needs the human body as its host. The life span of HIV outside of the body has not been determined. However, we know that HIV needs its host cell (a human), the body temperature, and the chemistry of the blood to survive. Out of the body, HIV is out of its environment. As the blood dries, the HIV will die. In areas like a syringe or on a razor in a medicine cabinet, HIV would probably live longer because of less airflow and it’s a more moist temperature controlled area. “Just remember, outside of the body HIV can’t survive. In minutes it will die and be harmless, but Universal Precautions should always be used.” Social media has lit up with reports that oranges exported from Libya were injected with blood that tested positive for HIV or AIDS. The posts show photos of halved oranges with red coloration inside similar to blood. A caption reads: “The immigration services of Algeria recovered a large quantity of these oranges coming from Libya. These oranges were injected with positive tested HIV and AIDS blood.” The publication Yemen Now used the same photos and reported that the oranges had been injected with hepatitis B and HIV-positive blood. In that version, the oranges were shipped from Egypt into neighboring countries. A translated photo caption reads: “Where did the meanness and hostility against Arabs and Muslims by the Zionists and their agents (come from?)” In reality, the oranges in the pictures weren’t injected with HIV, AIDS or hepatitis B-positive blood. The photos likely show the inside of an unripe blood orange , or the inside of a blood orange hybrid. Another variation of the eRumor claims that HIV-positive blood was found inside canned fruit from Thailand, which is also untrue. The Thai government responded directly to the claim and said it was false. ","Health - Medical"

"," Our investigation into a report that a Spider-Man watch caused chemical burns on a boy’s wrist is ongoing. A Facebook user named Melanie Crinklaw posted photos of an Amazing Spider-Man watch and what appeared to be chemical burns on a young boy’s wrist on February 11, 2015, with the caption: “A friend of mine Karen Foster: This is the Spider-Man watch (bought from Target) Caden was wearing when he feel asleep last night. When he woke up this morning this is what we found. 3rd degree burn (the black) and 2nd degree burn around it. He just went into surgery, they have to dig out the chemical/3rd degree burn. Then they are going to apply cadaver skin over that. He is going to have to be out of school a few weeks until everything is healed, due to the high risk of infection.

It should be noted, however, that the boy’s mother hadn’t commented on the claim, and the original post was the only place that the claim appeared online. One user forwarded the post to Target and questioned whether or not it was true. The retailer replied that it was looking into the claim: “Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

The Spider-Man watch from the picture does not appear on Target’s website , and it wasn’t offered for sale on similar retailers’ websites, either. It’s not clear when, or if, Target offered the watch for sale. Battery acid leaking from batteries that are used to power regular household items like watches can cause chemical burns in children.

"Millions of Turkeys Affected by Avian Flu – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/avian-flu-turkeys/"," Millions of turkeys were recalled after the CDC confirmed that the birds were carrying the avian flu virus. "," This is a fake news story that was published by the National Report. The false report went viral on November 20, 2014, just days before Americans prepared to celebrate Thanksgiving with traditional turkey dinners. According to the report: “Researchers at the National Turkey Producers Association have determined an at-home diagnostic (should be used) for determining if your turkey is safe to eat. Following cooking by any method, infected turkeys will develop green colorations across the wings and thighs. This is due to a chemical produced by the virus.” The National Report is a fake news website. The website’s disclaimer states that its “gentle form of satire parodies real news in a way that seems almost designed with the specific goal of tricking its readers.” Avian flu, which is commonly called “bird flu,” mostly affects waterfowl like ducks and geese. There’s no proof that the virus can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared poultry or eggs, the World Health Organization reports . The fake news report may have been inspired by an accurate report that bird flu had been found in 5,000 turkeys at a farm in northeastern Germany on November 4, 2014. The CDC did not find , however, that the bird flu outbreak impacted American consumers. The claim that retailers borrowed “Black Friday” from slave traders lit up social media in both 2013 and 2014.

"Over Five Million Health Care Polices Cancelled After ACA Roll Out – Special Report!","2015-03-17 21:40:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aca-5-million-cancellations/"," When discussing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Obama, on several occasions, promised Americans that if they have health insurance they could keep their old polices.   The President also said that if Americans liked their doctors they could keep their doctors. After the Obamacare roll out over 5 million people in the US have been notified by mail of policy cancellations from their health insurance companies because they do not meet up to the standards of the new law. "," There have been several reports from various news agencies, including CBS , Forbes , NBC and Fox that said millions throughout the U.S. are loosing their health insurance coverage.  The number has exceeded five million and it is expected to grow larger. The Obama administration “knew millions could not keep their health insurance.” This according to an October 28, 2013 article by NBC , which also warned that “50 to 75 percent of the 14 million consumers who buy their insurance individually can expect to receive a ‘cancellation’ letter or the equivalent over the next year because their existing policies don’t meet the standards mandated by the new health care law.” The state of California was hardest hit, according to a November 12, 2013 article by a CBS-TV affiliate in Sacramento that said, “More than 1 million cancellation notices have been sent to Californians as the Affordable Care Act begins allowing individuals to buy insurance through exchanges.” On November 20, 2013, citing the independent analysis of the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News article said that 50 to 100 million more people are expected to lose there health insurance policies. Insurance Premium Sticker Shock To make matters worse, the ACA is driving premium costs higher.  On November 6, 2013, NBC News reported that the new conditions set into policies “To a larger degree than other requirements of the law, it is fueling the ‘sticker shock’ now being voiced by some consumers about premiums for new policies, say industry experts.”  This means people will either have to pay more to get similar coverage to what they are used to or shop for a plan with a higher deductible and less benefits. On November 7, 2013 President Obama, in an interview on NBC News, said that he was sorry “to Americans who are losing their health plans.”   This according to a Washington Post article dated the same day. As of November 2, 2013, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that 106,185 people have signed up for new health care policies, a number 1/5 the number of enrollments anticipated by the Obama Administration.  This according to a November 13, 2013 article by CNBC. Keep Your Health Plan Act On October 28, 2013 HR-3350: Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 was introduced in the House of Representatives and is currently in the committee process.  The purpose of the bill is  “to authorize health insurance issuers to continue to offer for sale current individual health insurance coverage in satisfaction of the minimum essential health insurance coverage requirement, and for other purposes.” There are also a couple of bills on the Senate side. On October 30, 2013 S. 1617: If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act was introduced by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI).  It is currently in the committee process and has 43 Republican Senators sponsoring the bill.

On November 13, 2013 Fox News reported that the “House Democrats delivered a fix-it-or-else ultimatum Wednesday to President Obama, giving his administration until Friday to find an affordable solution for the millions of Americans losing their health plans under ObamaCare — or risk some Democrats backing a Republican solution.”   The article also said that the “ultimatum from President Obama’s own party is another sign of the unrest within the Democratic caucus about the cancellation notices.”   It is unknown if the Democrat Representatives would support the HR-3350 bill if the administration fails to come up with an alternative solution. There are resources on the Govtrack.com site for people to follow the bill and call their Congressional Representatives to urge them to support the bill.    Concerned citizens should also call the White House at (202) 456-1414 and ask the President to support the bill by encouraging the Senate to read the bill and vote for it.

"Test to determine a whether a stroke is happening-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stroke-test/"," The eRumor says that the American Stroke Associations suggests a simple three question test to give to someone who may be experiencing the symptoms of a stroke. "," According to the website of the American Stroke Association (ASA) this eRumor is true.  The American Stroke Association is a division of the American Heart Association. In an article published in February of 2003, the ASA says that a 60-second test can help determine whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  The three question test has been used by health care professionals as an initial way of determining whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  But a research project by North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, N.C. looked into the question of whether non-medical professionals could administer the short test and correctly identify the symptoms of a possible stroke.  The conclusions was yes, that bystanders could be helpful in determining whether a person is experiencing a stroke.  One of the reasons they looked into it was to see whether bystanders could be helpful to a 9-1-1 dispatcher in helping narrow down what is happening to a potential patient. The three questions given to the suspected stroke sufferers were: Can you raise your arms and keep them up? Can you smile? Can you repeat a simple sentence? The study found that when non-medical volunteers were asked by a telephone dispatcher to administer the test, they correctly identified the symptoms 96 percent of the time…especially the raising of the arms and the speaking of a simple sentence.  They were less effective in evaluating whether there was facial weakness in a smile, probably because of not knowing what the person’s normal smile looked like.  Doctors caution that this does not mean that citizens should try to diagnose stroke symptoms themselves. This study focused on citizens who were being given instruction over the telephone by emergency dispatchers. Any sign of weakness in the face, slurred speech, or weakness or numbness in the limbs should be evaluated by medical professionals immediately. If stroke victims are given proper help within 3 hours of the stroke, the ability to recover is greatly increased.

"," There is controversy over rBST, which stands for recombinant bovine somatotropin.  It is an artificial growth hormone used in cows. We’ve not found the family of Marissa, the 11-year old girl referenced in the eRumor.  If she is real her family’s suspicions are worthy of consideration but do not constitute proof that what they describe has been caused by ingesting milk from Wal-Mart.  There are other conditions that can cause early menstruation such as hypothyroidism.  Also, although there are fears, there is not scientific agreement about whether rBST is harmful to humans. RBST is a synthetic version of bST or BGH, a natural growth hormone in cows which, among other things, affects the amount of milk produced by a dairy cow.  Use of bST to increase milk production has been around since the 1930’s then along then the synthetic version came into popularity. Critics of the use of rBST say that it is banned for use in cattle in virtually every major country in the world except the United States.  They point out that there is an increase in health problems in cattle that produce the most milk so the use of rBST should be avoided on that ground. Supporters say rBST helps dairy farmers with better milk yield and that there has not been any proof that the hormone causes problems in humans.  It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although this eRumor focused on Wal-Mart milk there are several different milk companies that use cattle treated with rBST and Wal-Mart also sells milk from cows that are not injected with it.  Because of the controversy over rBST a lot of the milk products without it are labeled as such and are not hard to find. In March, 2008, Wal-Mart announced that rBST will no longer be found in milk from either Wal-Mart or Sams Club. Updated 3/25/08 ","Health - Medical"

"," The story is true, although with one glaring factual error. According to a Fox 23 Tulsa television interview with her parents, Matt and Lacey Butler, Little Halle was in a pre-kindergarten class at Okmulgee Primary School in Okmulgee, Oklahoma when a teacher did what seemed to be right, gave Halle some hand sanitizer to clean her hands before eating lunch.  Instead of rubbing it in, however, Halle ate it.  She licked it from her hand.  Shortly afterwards her behavior was alarming enough that she was taken to a local hospital.  Matt Butler says that when he arrived at the emergency room, his daughter was leaning against a wall, that her eyes would not focus, and she could not walk. Doctors determined that she was intoxicated. The eRumor says her blood alcohol level (BAC) was 85 percent, which   nobody would survive so that figure is obviously wrong.   A   BAC of .40% would be considered a lethal level. Hand sanitizers have an alcohol level of more than 60 percent.  Hard liquor, by comparison, is 40 percent alcohol while most beers are less than 5 percent alcohol. Unlike other poisons and alcoholic beverages, however, most hand sanitizers are easily accessible to children and most of us would not think about the danger. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that alcohol can cause drunkenness as well as serious poisoning leading to seizures, coma, and even death in young children—and that children are more sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol than adults.

"," We’ve checked with several     sources including the Environmental Protection agency and there is no     question that CFLs contain mercury, but the consensus is that the     consequences of breaking one do not need to be as expensive as depicted     in the eRumor. The story told is that of Brandy Bridges from Prospect, Maine.  She     did go through the steps described in the article but according to the     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of     Environmental Protection, State of Maine, she did not have to.      Once you’ve called a professional environmental clean-up organization,     it is required to handle any hazardous substance according to the     dictates of state law, which could be expensive. In all of the states that we checked, however, even though specific     steps should be taken to clean-up of a broken bulb, it is not required     that it be handled by expensive professionals.  Also, although any     levels of mercury should cause concern, the amount of mercury released     by the bulbs is relatively small. The Maine Bureau of Remediation & Waste Management gives the     following advice if a fluorescent bulb breaks in the home: 1.  Never use a vacuum to clean up the breakage     because it may spread mercury dust in the air. 2.  Keep     people and pets away from the scene of the break. 3.  Ventilate the area. 4.  If possible, reduce the temperature of the     room. 5.  Wear protective equipment such as rubber     gloves, safety glasses, a dust mask and old clothing. 6.  Remove large pieces and place is secure,     closed or airtight plastic bag. 7.  Collect smaller pieces and dust using a     disposable dustpan and broom. 8.  Put all material into an airtight plastic     bag.  Pat the breakage area with the sticky side of something like     duct tape.  Wipe the area with a damp cloth or paper towels to pick     up the rest. 9.  Put the debris and any materials used to     clean it up into a secure closed container and label it “Universal     Waste -Broken Lamp.” 10.  Take the container for recycling of universal waste. The Bureau also recommends that before     replacing a fluorescent lamp, spread a drop cloth on the floor so any     accidental breakage can more easily be cleaned up. How much mercury is in the average CFL?  According to the EPA there     are about 4mg compared with 500mg in the average mercury thermometer and     3000mg in the average older thermostat.
