"After a Schoolteacher Called Thomas Edison “Addled,” His Heroic Mother Stepped In-Mostly Fiction!","2015-10-05 11:13:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/after-a-schoolteacher-called-thomas-edison-addled-his-heroic-mother-stepped-in/"," After Thomas Edison’s school teacher called him addled or mentally ill in a letter, Edison’s mother hid the letter from the young inventor and homeschooled him so that he could reach his full potential. "," Many details of an inspirational story about Thomas Edison’s young life are accurate, but they’ve been used to form a fictional narrative about young Edison’s struggles as a student. The inspirational story begins by recalling how Thomas Edison’s grade school teacher wrote to his mother that Edison was “addled” and wouldn’t be allowed in school anymore. When Edison asked his mother what the letter said, she supposedly replied: His mother’s eyes were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child: Your son is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn’t have enough good teachers for training him. Please teach him yourself. After many, many years, after Edison’s mother died and he was now one of the greatest inventors of the century, one day he was looking through old family things. Suddenly he saw a folded paper in the corner of a drawer in a desk. He took it and opened it up. On the paper was written: Your son is addled [mentally ill]. We won’t let him come to school any more. Edison cried for hours and then he wrote in his diary: “Thomas Alva Edison was an addled child that, by a hero mother, became the genius of the century.” While the idea that Thomas Edison’s mother hid the fact that a schoolteacher had called him “addled” so that he could reach his full potential is inspirational — it’s also false. First, Thomas Edison was dyslexic, which would have made it difficult for him to succeed in an 1800s classroom. Research on dyslexia didn’t begin until the early 1900s, decades after Edison had left public schools, so little was known about it at the time. Thomas Edison’s struggles in school have been well documented over the years, as have his teacher’s view that Edison was “addled.” But the idea that Thomas Edison didn’t know that he’d been called addled is false. The Foundation for Economic Education reports that Edison was well aware of his teacher’s diagnosis, and that he was enraged by it: In 1854, Reverend G. B. Engle belittled one of his students, seven-year-old Thomas Alva Edison, as “addled.” This outraged the youngster, and he stormed out of the Port Huron, Michigan school, the first formal school he had ever attended. His mother, Nancy Edison, brought him back the next day to discuss the situation with Reverend Engle, but she became angry at his rigid ways. Everything was forced on the kids. She withdrew her son from the school where he had been for only three months and resolved to educate him at home. Although he seems to have briefly attended two more schools, nearly all his childhood learning took place at home. In the biography, “ Thomas Alva Edison: Great American Inventor ,” Louise Betts goes into more detail about why young Edison had problems with Reverend Engle’s teaching style: For a boy who was used to learning things his own way and to playing outside by himself all day long, sitting still in a one-room schoolhouse was pure misery. Tom did not like school one bit. His teacher, the Reverend G. Engle, and his wife made the children learn by memorizing their lessons and repeating them out loud. When a child forgot an answer, or had not studied well enough, Reverend Engle whipped the unfortunate pupil with a leather strap! Mrs. Engle also heartily approved of using the whip as a way of teaching students better study habits. her whippings were often worse than her husband’s! Tom was confused by Reverend Engle’s way of teaching. He could not learn through fear. Nor could he just sit and memorize. He liked to see things for himself and ask questions. But Reverend Engle grew as exasperated by Tom’s questions as Mr. Edison did. For that reason, Tom Learned very little in his first few months, and his grades were bad. Years later, Tom would say of his school experience, “I remember I used to never be able to get along at school. I was always at the foot (bottom) of the class. I used to feel that the teachers did not sympathize with me, and that my father thought I was stupid.” Then, after Thomas Edison told his mother that his teacher had referred to him as addled, the two of them went to the school in search of an apology, according to his biography: “My son is not backward!” declared Mrs. Edison, adding, “and I believe I ought to know. I taught children once myself!” Despite her efforts, neither the Reverend nor Mr.s Engle would change their opinion of young Tom Edison. But Mrs. Edison was equally strong in her opinion. Finally, she realized what she had to do. “All right, Mr.s Edison said, “I am herby taking my son out of your school.” Tom could hardly believe his ears! “I’ll instruct him at home myself,” he heard her say. Tom looked up at his mother, this wonderful woman who believed in him. He promised himself that he would make his mother proud of him. Later in life, Edison said, “My mother was the making of me. She was so true, so sure of me: and I felt I had something to live for, someone I must not disappoint.” However, there’s no record of Edison’s quote from the inspirational story, “Thomas Alva Edison was an addled child that, by a hero mother, became the genius of the century.” So, it’s true that Thomas Edison’s teacher called him addled or difficult, that his mother defended and homeschooled him, and that she had a big impact on the man that he became. But the inspirational account of Edison’s mother hiding the teacher’s letter from him and lying about why he was being homeschooled to help him reach his full potential is false.

"Boy Sang Gospel Song Until Kidnapper Released Him-Truth!","2015-03-31 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/willie-myrick/"," This is an inspirational story about Willie Myrick who was allegedly abducted by an unknown man in Atlanta, Ga.  The boy sang a Gospel song non-stop for three hours, which irritated his kidnapper so much that he eventually released him. "," The incident was real, although the age of Willie Myrick in numerous reports varied from 9 to 11 years of age. According to an April 18, 2014, article by the New York Daily News, an unknown man used cash to lure young Myrick close enough to grab and force the boy into his vehicle on the evening of March 31. During his close to 3 hour ordeal, Myrick repeatedly sang “Every Praise,” a Gospel song by Hezekiah Walker. The article said, “[the] tune sent the suspect into a cursing fit and he stopped the car near East Point.” The kidnapper opened the car door, released Myrick and warned him not to tell anyone. That was one order that Myrick refused to obey and he has been telling the world about the incident since his release. When artist Hezekiah Walker got news of this, the artist flew from New York to meet with Myrick and his church family at the Mt. Carmel Baptist Church in southwest Atlanta to celebrate the boy’s 10th birthday. The article said that everybody present joined in the singing of “the life-saving song together as tears rolled down Myrick’s cheeks.” Atlanta Police released an all points bulletin (BOLO) with a sketch of the suspect with the offer $10,000 reward for his capture.

"The Cross in the Flag-Truth!","2015-03-28 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cross-flag/"," A picture of a large American flag with what appears to be a cross shining through it from the sun in the background on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. "," We’ve had some readers ask if this is a doctored photo. The locals in Yuma, Arizona say it’s authentic. The flag is said to have been hung between two cranes in the parking lot of Fry’s grocery store in Yuma on September 12, 2001, the day after the Attack on America. According to the folks at the Yuma Elks Lodge the flag is 60 feet tall and 120 feet wide. The picture was taken by Janna Noe who snapped the photo with her digital camera and noticed the cross when she later looked at the pictures. When light shines through translucent fabric, there is frequently a distribution of the light along the pattern of the weave of the fabric.  This particular picture appears to have been taken when the sun was toward the upper portion of the blue section of the flag so the upper portion of the vertical line is shorter than the lower portion, resulting in a traditional looking cross.  If the sun had been in the middle of the blue portion of the flag, the lines would have been more equal in each direction.

"Butch and Eddie O’Hare-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:38:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/butchandeddie/"," Butch O’Hare, the war hero after whom Chicago’s O’Hare airport is named, was the son of mob lawyer Eddie O’Hare.  The email tells the story of Butch O’Hare’s bravery as well as a decision of conscience on the part of his father that may have contributed to his character. "," Lt. Commander Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare is the subject of many articles that document his outstanding service as a pilot during World War II.  He was presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions against the Japanese and defending the U.S.S. Lexington.  According to the official citation of his Medal of Honor , he won the recognition “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat…”  It says he was the section leader of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942.  According to an article on aviation-history.com , six Wildcats were sent into the air to protect the Lexington from Japanese bombers.  O’Hare and his wingman spotted the enemy planes first.  The wingman’s guns jammed, however, and the other four planes were too far away, so O’Hare faced 9 twin-engine Japanese bombers alone.  He shot down five of them and damaged a sixth before other U.S. fighters arrived.  No enemy bombs made it to the Lexington.  The Medal of Honor citation calls it “…one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation…”  O’Hare was killed in November of 1943 during the battle for the Gilbert Islands in the South Pacific.  He was accidentally shot down by another American plane during a night mission.  It is true that Chicago’s O’Hare airport is named after him and there is a restored airplane on display there similar to the one that O’Hare flew. Butch’s father, Eddie O’Hare, was an attorney and business partner of the famous gangster Al Capone.  He helped run Capone’s horse and dog track operation in Chicago.  He was described as being devoted to his son.  There was a point when Eddie decided to secretly become an informant for the Internal Revenue Service and it was with his help that the government convicted and imprisoned Capone for income tax evasion.  Some have said that Eddie became an informant because of a change of heart and a desire to go straight.  Others have said it was merely his way of saving his neck in the face of potential prosecution.  It was an article in Collier’s magazine in 1947 about Eddie O’Hare’s work as an informant that helped win public favor for him and the eventual naming of Chicago’s airport after his war-hero sun.   The article was written by Frank J. Wilson, the Treasury Department investigator with whom O’Hare had worked on the case.  The article was titled “Undercover man: he trapped Capone.”  Wilson called O’Hare one of his best undercover men.

"Canadian Gordon Sinclair’s commentary on America-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gordonsinclair/"," This is a heart-warming and encouraging email that quotes what it says is a Canadian television broadcast by Gordon Sinclair.  It is a tribute to America. "," The commentary by Gordon Sinclair is true, although people along the way have altered portions of it. Originally written for a Toronto newspaper, it was broadcast on June 5, 1973 on CFRB radio in Toronto, Canada. It had a big impact at the time. A recording of Sinclair reading his commentary became a best-selling record that hit Canada’s top 30.  Canadian broadcaster Byron MacGregor produced a version in his own voice.  It was called “Americans” and became a hit record as well, rising to Canada’s top 5, selling 3.5 million copies.  That meant 3 gold records for MacGregor.  He donated the proceeds to the American Red Cross. Both the eRumor and the text from the original broadcast are below. Original script of Gordon Sinclair’s commentary: “The Americans” The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the earth. As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtse. Who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did. They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries into help… Managua Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped. The Marshall Plan .. the Truman Policy .. all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war-mongering Americans. I’d like to see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. Come on… let’s hear it! Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar or the Douglas 107? If so, why don’t they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or women on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times … and safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them … unless they are breaking Canadian laws..are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here. When the Americans get out of this bind … as they will… who could blame them if they said ‘the hell with the rest of the world’. Let someone else buy the Israel bonds, Let someone else build or repair foreign dams or design foreign buildings that won’t shake apart in earthquakes. When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke. I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don’t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our neighbours have faced it alone and I am one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians. And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th Annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. This year’s disasters .. with the year less than half-over… has taken it all and nobody…but nobody… has helped. ORIGINAL SCRIPT AND AUDIO COURTESY STANDARD BROADCASTING CORPORATION LTD.

"Air Force General Richard Hawley’s comments on the Attack on America-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hawley/"," A series of strongly worded observations about reactions to the Attack on America from a U.S. Air Force General, Richard Hawley. "," General Richard Hawley is now retired, but was most recently the commander of the Air Combat Command, headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.  He is a decorated pilot who flew more than 400 combat missions in Vietnam. TruthOrFiction.com contacted General Hawley and he says he did not write this eRumor that bears his name. He did, however, send us his own comments about the issues that the eRumor addresses: From the real General Richard Hawley: 1) Goodness, Evil and Relativity: There are some really good people in this world. They volunteer to help those who need it, and ask nothing in return. There are also some really bad people in this world. They exploit those who need help, or who have less wit or “charisma”, and motivate them to join in committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against people they don’t even know. Then there are the rest of us. Average people who try each day to do no harm, to provide for their families, to do an occasional act of kindness. The evil that was perpetrated against our land on 9/11 was the product of Mullahs who see our prosperity and power as a threat to their control over the uneducated Muslim masses on whose shoulders they ride through life. And so they preach hate. They are evil. 2) Violence begets violence: It’s true. Violence does beget violence. But sometimes there is no alternative but to confront those who would perpetrate evil acts against us. This is one of those times. We are blessed to have courageous men and women willing to put their lives on the line to track down and annihilate those who have been so imbued with evil as to be beyond redemption. But violence is not a strategy. It is a necessary and fully justified reaction to an unimaginable threat. But it is not a strategy. If we are to win this war, we must defeat the Mullahs. And to defeat the Mullahs, we must find ways to separate them from their uneducated flocks. We cannot kill all those who have been taught to hate us, nor should we wish to. Far better to change their minds than to change their state of being. 3) The intelligence community let us down: Well, maybe just a little. Lots of senior and not so senior intelligence people became just as enamored of high tech gadgets as their political masters. The protests over our evisceration of the human intelligence component of the agency were not very loud or forceful. Keeping spies on the ground is a high risk and often dirty business, and it wasn’t just liberal politicians who didn’t have much stomach for it. 4) Poverty is the breeding ground for terrorists: No, it isn’t; but religious extremism is. The Mullahs fear our wealth and power because it shows that a secular society with democratic institutions and a free market economy can do a better job of taking care of its peoples’ needs, both spiritual and physical, than the oppressive Islamic regimes that they aspire to lead. The Mullahs are the problem, not poverty, but poverty does make it easier for the Mullahs to spread their evil – as do governments that tolerate and even reinforce their hateful message. 5) Profiling: We are at war here! We are not talking about traffic stops. If we were at war with Iceland, I would expect those charged with our defense to pay very close attention to any Icelander who ventured near our shores. In this war I expect them to pay very close attention to Muslims with ties to the places that spew hatred against us. Random checks when there are no such obvious targets available are a good way to keep the evil ones guessing, but let’s not make small children and grandmothers take their shoes off while we watch far more likely candidates walk aboard unchecked. 6) Resolutions: a. Never forget that what happened on September the 11th of 2001 was an act of war. b. Never sit silently by while someone tries to justify what happened on that day as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East or elsewhere. c. Fly our nation’s flag proudly – it represents this world’s greatest hope to move beyond the pain and suffering that inflict so many across the globe. Richard E.

"Woman who preached to Alaska Airlines passengers on doomed flight-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:57:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alaskaflight261/"," The email being circulated says that a pastor’s wife on a doomed Alaska Airlines plane addressed the passengers for 9 minutes and led them in prayer before the plane crashed.  This allegedly came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings.  The original version of the eRumor said the pastor’s wife was from Idaho.  More recent versions say it was a pastor’s wife from Washington.  Further, the email states that the pilot says there was no explanation for why the plane was able to stay aloft for those final 9 minutes. "," There is no evidence this happened.  The National Transportation Safety Board has now released the cockpit voice recordings from the flight and there is nothing like this story on them. Alaska flight 261 crashed off the coast of California on January 31, 2000.  The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner carried 88 people.  There were no survivors. Among the passengers were Joe and Linda Knight from Monroe, Washington.  They were co-pastors of The Rock Church in Monroe.  Their adult son, who is also a minister, is quoted in news reports as saying Linda was the kind of person who would probably preach to the passengers during an emergency.  It is possible that’s where the story originated. When the eRumor first started, there were several things about it that didn’t seem valid. First, the claim that the information came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings was not credible.  The tapes were in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board who keeps things like that very secure.  It would be illegal for anyone to release that kind of information before the NTSB does. Second, we talked with several pilots who fly the MD-80 and they all agreed that the cockpit voice recorder does not record what is said in the passenger cabin over the P.A. system.  It records the cockpit crew and radio conversations. Third, it is not credible that any passenger would have been able to spend 9 minutes talking over the P.A. system to fellow passengers.  According to published news reports, the first time the plane reported trouble to air traffic controllers was at 4:10pm.  The last transmission from the plane was at 4:17pm and it disappeared from radar at 4:21pm.  That meant there were about 11 minutes from the beginning of the emergency to the crash.  For Linda Knight to have addressed the passengers for 9 minutes, she would have been given the microphone within 2 minutes of when the crew first reported a problem.  If anything would have been communicated to the passengers during that time, it would have been from the crew and if they felt a crash was imminent, they would have been talking about emergency procedures, not letting a passenger address the other passengers. Finally, there is good explanation how the plane stayed in the air.  The pilots were able to struggle to stabilize the plane and had reported to controllers that they thought they could make it to Los Angeles International Airport.  It is believed that there was catastrophic failure that led to the plane’s final plunge into the ocean.  So this story felt, acted, and tasted like a rumor from the beginning.

"Picture of a Surgeon Holding Hands With a 21-week Old Fetus-Truth! &  Disputed!","2015-03-17 21:45:40","https://www.truthorfiction.com/babysamuel/"," A picture is being circulated that says it is from surgery on a 21-week-old   fetus…and the fetus is holding a doctor’s hand. "," The surgery cited in this story did take place, but the accounts of what actually happened are hotly disputed. Photo by Michael Clancy Dr. Joseph Bruner at Vanderbilt is known for his work in fetal surgery, especially on babies with spina bifida, a condition in which the spine does not close properly during development. Vanderbilt confirms that little Samuel Armus was 21 weeks-old in the womb when this surgery took place in 1999, which made the surgery very risky because if anything went wrong, the baby wouldn’t survive on its own.  Dr. Bruner and his colleagues, however, had done numerous successful spina bifida surgeries on fetuses that are not yet viable. In this particular surgery, photographer Michael Clancy was in the operating room to document surgery on such a young fetus. Clancy said that “out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one’s hands were near it. It was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor’s finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist.” The picture became a sensation as a forwarded email especially among opponents of abortion.  The surgeon, Dr. Bruner, told USA Today in 2000 that the picture was being treated like an urban legend and that he’d even received a report that a team of medical experts had called it a hoax.  Bruner confirmed that the surgery and the photo were real but said that it was “not true” that the baby reached out of the womb and grabbed his hand, as some of the forwarded emails alleged.  “ Samuel and his mother, Julie, were under anesthesia and could not move,” he said.  “The baby did not reach out. The baby was anesthetized. The baby was not aware of what was going on.” Michael Clancy, who owns the copyright to the photo, was stunned by Bruner’s comments and maintains that they do not fit what he saw happen during the surgery and when he took his pictures. On his website at www.michaelclancy.com , Clancy said he knows what he saw and also quoted a nurse at Vanderbilt who told him that she’d seen babies do that “all the time.” The surgery was successful and little Samuel Armas was born on December 2, 1999.

She had not told her husband Ted Turner about becoming a Christian but when he learned of it, she says it was one of the factors that broke up their marriage. She said that she knows it was not fair to keep the news of her faith from him, but that she was “…yearning for the spiritual that I had not had.  And I knew that if I told him or asked him before I did it, that he would talk me out of it.” Turner is from a Christian background and even once considered becoming a missionary, but has been critical of Christianity and once called it “a religion for losers” but later apologized. In her book, Fonda talks openly and passionately about her Christianity and how much it has meant to her but that like her life, her faith is still progressing. When she made the decision to become a Christian it was within the context of Evangelical Christian friendships but in the book she avoids describing that event in detail.

Tommy Dorsey the composer of “Precious Lord Take My Hand”       was a jazz pianist and composer was born in 1899 and died in 1993. He is regarded by many as the father of gospel music. After a successful career as a blues musician, he switched to gospel       music. For more than 40 years, he was the choir director Chicago’s Pilgrim       Baptist Church. The actual story of the tragic death of his wife is a bit different       from the eRumor. In an account in his own words written for Guideposts Magazine,       Dorsey said he was actually scheduled to be in St. Louis to sing for       a revival. He had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of       pregnancy When he left his home to head for St. Louis, he realized that he had       forgotten his music case, so he returned to get it and found his       wife sleeping. He stood next to her and felt that something was telling him to stay       home. He decided to leave and headed back to his car for the drive to the       meetings. The next night at the revival and after he had finished singing, a       telegram was handed to him that said his wife had just died. He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby       boy before she died. Before the night was over, the baby had died as well. Dorsey went through a difficult period after that. He said he wanted to give up serving the Lord and go back to jazz. One of the thoughts that haunted him was whether his reluctance to       leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he       had been disobedient by ignoring it. He vowed that he would never be insensitive to such a leading again. It was during a subsequent visit to a friend that he sat down at a       piano and found himself at peace and a melody being played. That became the song “Precious Lord Take My Hand.” Dorsey wrote, “ As the Lord gave me       these words and melody, He also healed my spirit. I learned that       when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from God,       this is when He is closest, and when we are most open to His       restoring power. And so I go on living for God willingly and       joyfully, until that day comes when He will take me and gently lead       me home.” ","Inspirational"

He is remembered in Sydney for his nearly 40-years of colorful lettering, which was designed to prompt people to think about eternity and their own mortality. "," According to multiple sources, this       story is true.

For years, the citizens of the city wondered who was writing the       “one word sermon” and why. Every once in a while, someone would claim responsibility for the       graffiti and the newspapers would print the stories. In 1956, Stace was a member of the Burton Street Baptist Church,       where he also served as the janitor and a prayer leader. One day, the pastor of the church, Rev. Lisle M. Thompson, stumbled       across Stace while he was writing his chalk message on a sidewalk       and the mystery of the “Eternity” messages all over Sydney       was solved. Stace said that after his conversion to Christianity, he heard a       sermon in which the evangelist said  “Eternity! Eternity!

"," This story is a first for TruthOrFiction.com. There is no eRumor circulating that we know of about Ashley Smith, but thousands of people have come to TruthOrFiction.com and used our search engine to try to find her name and, presumably, the truth of her story. We’ve drawn from a story from Assist News Service to provide the details. ASSIST News Service (ANS) – PO Box 2126, Garden Grove, CA 92842-2126 USA Visit our website at: www.assistnews.net — E-mail: danjuma1@aol.com Thursday, March 17, 2005 ASHLEY SMITH’S FAITH AND CALMNESS LED TO NICHOLS SURRENDER She Believes God Brought Him to Her Door By Ginny Johnston/Associated Press/CNN Special to ASSIST News Service ATLANTA, GA (ANS) — Ashley Smith, the women held hostage in her apartment by the Brian Nichols, the suspect Atlanta’s courthouse killings, said during the time she was held captive, she talked to him about her faith and trust in God, read to him from Pastor Rick Warren’s best-selling book, “Purpose Driven Life,” which is currently selling about a million copies a month. (Pictured: Purpose Driven Life book cover). Smith, a 26-year-old waitress, mother and student said she calmly talked to Nichols, turning from hostage to confidant as they discussed God, family and pancakes, along with the massive manhunt going on outside her apartment. (Pictured: Ashley Smith, 26, of Atlanta recounts her hostage experience with murder suspect Brian Nichols during an interview in Atlanta Sunday – AP/Atlanta Journal Constitution, Curtis Compton). “I believe God brought him to my door,” Smith said just hours after her 911 call ended a manhunt for Nichols, who is accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth. Smith said Nichols, 33, took her hostage in the parking lot outside her apartment when she returned from a store about 2 a.m. “He said, ‘I’m not going to hurt you if you just do what I say,’ ” she said. ” ‘I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt anybody else.’ “She said Nichols tied her up with masking tape, a curtain and extension cord and told her to sit in the bathroom while he took a shower. “I thought he was going to strangle me,” she said. Though her ordeal began with Nichols sticking a gun in her side and tying her up, it ended with the weapons on the floor, as he let her go to see her young daughter. After hours of talking about the killings, their families and God, Smith said Nichols just wanted to be normal. “I honestly think when I looked at him that he didn’t want to do it anymore,” Smith said in a statement televised on CNN. If he did not give up, she told him, “lots more people are probably going to get hurt, and you’re probably going to die.” During the night, Smith had gradually earned his trust and the two were able to relate about family matters. “I told him I was supposed to see my little girl the next morning at 10,” Smith said. “I asked him if I could go and he said no.” The situation also stirred emotion in the young mother. Choking back tears, she said she told Nichols that her husband died four years ago and that if he hurt her, her daughter would not have a mother or father. Eventually he untied her, and some of the fear lessened as they talked. Nichols told Smith he felt like “he was already dead,” but Smith encouraged him to consider the fact that he was still alive a “miracle.” “You’re here in my apartment for some reason,” she told him, saying he might be destined to be caught and to spread the word of God to fellow prisoners. Smith called 911 after she was freed, and police quickly surrounded her suburban apartment complex. When authorities arrived at the scene, Nichols gave up peacefully, waving a white towel in surrender, after Smith had convinced him to give up. Nichols allegedly overpowered a courthouse deputy who was escorting him to his rape trial Friday and took the deputy’s gun, then entered the courtroom where his trial was being held and killed the presiding judge and court stenographer. He also is accused of killing a deputy who tried to stop him outside the courthouse and a federal agent during his flight from authorities. Since his surrender and arrest, Nichols went before a judge on Tuesday, and was told that he now faces murder charges for the crime spree that left an Atlanta judge and three others dead. He remained calm and only spoke once in the court as the judge asked him if he had any questions. “Not at this time,” said Nichols. He had been in federal custody since his arrest on a federal firearms charge. But officials announced Monday that the charge had been dropped so he could be handed over to Fulton County authorities, who will likely be the first to prosecute him. Nineteen officers accompanied Nichols inside the cinderblock jail room on Tuesday at Fulton County Jail, as he went before the judge, his hands and ankles shackled as he was informed that authorities plan to charge him with murder. He faces federal and state charges in the deaths of a judge, a court reporter, a deputy and a federal agent. Prosecutors will likely decide within 30 days what new charges to file, said Fulton County district attorney’s spokesman Erik Friedly. Nichols was being retried for rape and other charges when he escaped on Friday. That case was declared a mistrial Monday at the request of Nichols’ attorney, Friedly said. Barry Hazen, Nichols’ attorney on the rape charge, has said continuing with that earlier case would be a waste of time and tax dollars. “He’s facing four homicide charges that could carry the death penalty. In the best-case scenario, he’s in jail for life. What’s the point?” Hazen said Sunday.

"," The story of Stuart Hamblen, Billy Graham, and John Wayne is true but this account of it includes some misinformation. Stuart Hamblen was a popular singer, songwriter, actor, poet, and radio personality from the 1930s through the 1950s.  He was first a hit on radio but appeared in films with Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and John Wayne and wrote several chart-topping country songs.  Some have called him radio’s first singing cowboy. Billy Graham came to Los Angeles in 1949 for what became an historic evangelistic crusade.  Graham’s long time associate and crusade song leader Cliff Barrows told TruthOrFiction.com that Graham’s appearance on Hamblen’s radio show was arranged as part of the publicity for the crusade, not because Hamblen wanted to poke fun at Graham.  Although Hamblen was known for his hard living and drinking, he had been reared as the son of a Methodist minister and warmly welcomed Graham as a guest.  It was at that interview that Graham extended an invitation to Hamblen to attend the crusade and he accepted.  According to Barrows, Hamblen later contacted Graham at his hotel and asked to talk.  The result was that he “surrendered his life to Christ.”  He was not drunk and Graham did not refuse to pray for him, according to Barrows.  Hamblen’s became the first publicized conversion from the 1949 crusade and contributed to the decision to extend the event, which lasted for 8 weeks and put Billy Graham on the map. Barrows said that it was on a street in Hollywood that Hamblen later ran into John Wayne who asked him about the rumor around town that he’d changed his ways.  Hamblen told Wayne that it was no secret what God had done for him and that he could do it for Wayne too.  Wayne said it sounded like a song and suggested he write one.  The result was one of Hamblen’s best known tunes, It is No Secret What God Can Do. It was a crossover song that is regarded as the first to have been #1 in the gospel, country, and pop categories.  The original manuscript of It is No Secret is buried in the cornerstone of one of the Copyright Buildings of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. After his conversion Hamblen announced that he was going to devote his time to “serving Christ” and he started a new radio program titled The Cowboy Church of the Air which became nationally syndicated.  A confrontation developed with his sponsors, however, when he told them that he would refuse to advertise alcohol.  His much publicized departure from the program resulted in his being asked to run for President of the United States in 1952 under the banner of the Prohibition party.  He accepted and ran fourth to Republican Dwight Eisenhower who was elected president. update 02/10/09 ","Inspirational"

But Inaccurate Details!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rickenbacker/"," The story of a man who would routinely take a bucket of shrimp to the end of a pier and fed them to sea gulls.  He would say “thank you” to them as he did.  It turned out to be World War I military hero Eddie Rickenbacker who regarded a sea gull as the beginning of a series of events that saved his life while drifting for 24 days in a raft after a plane crash into the Pacific. "," The story about the plane crash and the seagull landing on the head of Eddie Rickebacker is true, according to the autobiography of Eddie Rickenbacker. The story of the man feeding the seagulls in the eRumor came from excerpt from a book by popular minister and inspirational author Max Lucado.  The version circulating on the Internet contains details that did not appear in Lucado’s book titled “In the Eye of the Storm.” Rickenbacker was a pilot and a hero during WW I who became an ace and was presented with The Medal of Honor.   The crash at sea took place in 1942 when he was sent by the U.S. government on a tour of the Pacific theater.  The four-engine B-17 bomber on which he was a passenger went off course and ran out of fuel at sea. He went on to be a race car driver, an aviation consultant, and airline executive.   Rickenbacker was not the founder of Eastern Airlines but was very influential in the General Motors acquisition of Eastern Air Transport, a compilation of North American Aviation and Pitcairn Aviation Company that was owned by Clement Keys.   When General Motors acquired the company from Keys they renamed it to Eastern Air Lines.  In January of 1934 Rickenbacker began his term  general manager for Eastern Air Lines and later served also as the company’s president.

"“Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” Was Written To Comfort a Grieving Daughter -Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rudolph/"," Claims that Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer was created by Robert L. May to comfort his grieving daughter who had lost her mother to cancer. "," There is some truth to the story, Robert L. May wrote the Christmas poem “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” in 1939.  We have researched dozens of sources which include interviews with May himself and his children and there is never a mention that he did this for comforting his child from the death of her mother. Robert L. May worked as a catalog advertising copywriter for Montgomery Wards & Company when the company, recognizing his skills in poetry,  asked him for ideas on a booklet of illustrated poems as a promotional give away. May’s wife, Evelyn, died of cancer in July of 1939, according to his account in a December 22, 1975 Gettysburg Times article.  This is one year later from the account of the eRumor. May also had a daughter, name Barbara, and according to a Paul Harvey Rest of the Story article she was recruited to help in development of the story to make sure Rudolf  would appeal to children.  May would read to her his verses and if she inquired about the meaning of any words he would simplify the vocabulary. May pitched his story to Montgomery Wards executives about the ugly duckling reindeer with three possible names.  The company turned down the idea and asked May to return with a second draft.  When May came back with his improved story that included sketches by an illustrator the company executive accepted it, named the red nosed reindeer Rudolf and the rest is history. The stores distributed 2,400,000 copies of the booklet during the 1939 and 1946 Christmas season promotions.  The year 1946 proved to be such a financial success for the company that the executives awarded May with the copyrights of his popular Christmas story. This eRumor may have been sparked by a story in the book “ Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas ” by Ace Collins that said May created the character of Rudolf to bring hope and comfort to his grieving daughter, Barbara, after the death of his wife.  Collins told TruthOrFiction.Com that his source for this version of the story came from someone working in the Montgomery Wards & Co. public relations department. The story of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer has been released world wide in twenty-five languages. In 1949 Johnny Marks, May’s brother-in-law, adapted the story to music and Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer was immortalized by singing cowboy star, Gene Autry.  Over two million copies of the recording sold. updated 12-22-10 ","Inspirational"

The story was told to him by a rabbi, and Mandino called it “partially apocryphal but poignant.” Art historians and forensic experts have also concluded that the hands Dürer sketched aren’t those of a laborer. “The praying hands in Dürer’s drawing are thin, with elongated fingers and well groomed nails, not calloused from manual work. The forearms are elegantly clothed, with sleeves made of expensive material, obviously the dress of an affluent person,” W.R. Albury and Dr. George Weisz, both professors at the University of New England, said in Hektoen International .

Sendler was a Catholic social worker during the 1940s who saw the handwriting on the wall for the Jews of Poland.  She became concerned for the children in the Warsaw Ghetto, which was one of the largest ghettos of Jews established by the Nazis.  The population of the Warsaw Ghetto dropped from 450,000 to about 70,000 people because of starvation, sickness, and tens of thousands of Jews deported to concentration camps and death. Sendler convinced Jewish parents that their children were facing death either in the Ghetto or in concentration camps and offered to rescue them.  She smuggled the children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and hid them in the homes of Poles who adopted them or in orphanages or convents.  She made lists of the children’s names and family connections and hid them in jars in her garden so that someday she could find the children and tell them who they were. Sendler was eventually discovered, arrested, tortured, and imprisoned by the Nazis.  The Polish underground bribed a guard to let her escape and she spent the rest of the war in hiding.

"," The videos are real and Hee Ah Lee is Authentic. It is the story of a mother and a daughter who have overcome odds from the very beginning. Lee’s mother became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man.  Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal.  She elected to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury.  The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country.  Sun thought her baby was beautiful, however, and was determined that she would live a successful life. When Lee was a pre-schooler her mother decided that she wanted her daughter to take piano lessons and for two reasons.  One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil.  The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything.   For six months piano schools turned them down then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit.  It became a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a confrontation in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration.  She said Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played the children’s song she had been trying to learn.  That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at age 7 that Lee won Korea’s 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea. Today Lee is 22, has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances.  Her first album titled “Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers” will be released in June. Lee gives tribute to her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, “as time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=L44xVsz0ZR0&rel=1 Updated 2/21/08","Inspirational"

"," The story and the video are real, although some of the facts are wrong. The release and reunion of Christian the Lion took place in Kenya more than 30-years ago.  The eRumor with the video link about Christian began circulating in July, 2008. Australian John Rendall and his friend Ace Berg bought the lion cub from Harrods in London in 1969 when the world famous store had an exotic animals department. Herrods had gotten the cub from Illfracombe zoo and it was on display at the store in cage when spotted by Rendall and Berg. Christian lived in the basement of Rendall’s flat in Chelsea and for a year was a pampered cat.  And a clean one too, according to Rendall.  He unfailingly used a very large kitty litter box and was jointly cared for by Rendall, Berg, and two of their female friends. Christian eventually grew to nearly 200 pounds and started growing a mane, which made him look fearsome even though he was very friendly and accompanied his owners to all kinds of events.  He became a feature at Rendall’s furniture store and one day Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna walked into the store and saw Christian.  They were actors who had been in the film Born Free, the true story of a lion cub named Elsa that was successfully rehabilitated into the wild in Africa by conservationist George Adamson and his wife Joy. It was decided that Adamson and Africa might be the next destination for Christian.  Adamson was cautious because Elsa had been an African lion born in Africa.  Christian was from London and had lived a very different first year of life. In Arica, Christian befriended a lion from the Born Free film named Boy.  Adamson added a female lion to the friendships and began the process of educating Christian about the wild. Rendell and Berg would visit from time to time to check on Christian’s progress but it was in 1974 that Adamson told them that Christian had finally adapted to the wild.  He had a litter of cubs, did not return to the camp very often and was the leader of his pride (Boy had been shot and killed in a tragic event near the camp.) Upon hearing the news, Rendell and Berg decided they would make a final trip to say goodbye even though Adamson told them it might be a waste of time.  Christian had not been seen in nine months.  But when the two men arrived in Kenya Adamson told them that Christian and his pride of lionesses and cubs had arrived the night before, almost as though he had known they were coming.  Adamson said Christian was sitting on his favorite rock outside the camp waiting for them.  The reunion, as seen on the video, was one of overwhelming joy and tears.  Afterwards Adamson warned that the lionesses didn’t seem too pleased with what was going on so it might be time to leave.  It was the last time that Christian was ever seen. Adamson continued his work in Kenya but was shot and killed in 1989 by either poachers or bandits. A film and a book were made about the remarkable story of Christian the Lion.

The email says that the t-shirts along with MP3 players loaded with Biblical teaching to help raise their spirits were given to them by Campus Crusade For Christ organization. "," This story is true and the T-Shirts were given to 33 trapped Chilean miners by the local branch of the International Campus Crusade for Christ, according to a statement on the ministry web site . As well as the bilingual display of gratitude saying, “Thank You Lord”, the tee shirts included an Old Testament quotation from Psalm 95:4, “In his hand are the depths of the earth, and mountain peaks belong to him.” The Campus Crusade For Christ ministry also provided each miner with an MP3 player with an audio version of the story of Jesus and audio Bible. After being trapped 2,300 below the Earth’s surface for 69 days all 33 miners were rescued. Background On August 5, 2010 a gold and copper mine in San Juan, Chile collapsed, sealing 33 miners from the outside world. The mine is located approximately 500 miles North of the Chilean capital, Santiago. After the cave in, drilling efforts began in an attempt to locate the lost minors and continued day and night.  On August 27, the 17th day of the rescue attempt, tapping on the drill was heard by the rescue team on the surface. The trapped men had managed to escape to the safety of a refuge area in the mine about 2,300 feet below the surface. When the drill was pulled back to the surface rescuers found a note attached that said, “Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33” – “We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us.” Chilean President Sebastián Piñera shows note from trapped miners The minors were trapped underground for a record breaking 69 days and spent much of their time in prayer to keep their spirits up as they waited on their rescue. .  At first, the 33 men were surviving from rationed  food and water in the refuge area.  Later a relief tube was sent down to them to replenish supplies and bring fresh air into the cramped living space which would be their home for more than two months. Computer Image of Rescue Pod Meanwhile on the surface, as the world hoped and prayed for the trapped miners, a team of engineers worked vigorously on a rescue plan to get the men safely recovered. The Chilean engineers consulted the National Aeronautical Space Administration’ (NASA) Engineering and Safety Center based at Huntsville’s Marshall Space flight Center to ensure every safety consideration would be covered in the rescue operation. Every “what if” scenario had to be examined and evaluated. The Chilean engineers sent Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to the NASA team for review for their suggestion of procedure and design modifications of the rescue pod.  The Chileans also consulted the Space Agency for nutritional guidelines and advice in maintaining a healthy mental attitude for the men who were trapped in a confined area for so long. Chief of rescue operations Andres Sougarret welcomes rescued miner Juan Illanes topside. When the news first broke that the miners were found alive the estimated time of the rescue operation was four months. On October 12th, one by one, every miner was raised to the surface.  After medical evaluation of the now freed minors and some time to be with their loved ones, many involved returned on October 17th to the scene dubbed “Campo Esperanza”- “Camp Hope” to celebrate a Thanksgiving Mass.

"," The story about the salvation of Bulgaria’s Jews is true but this particular version of the story has some factual problems. The information about the famous Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan is not correct.  He was not from Bulgaria.  He was born on a kibbutz in Israel and his parents were immigrants from Ukraine. Also, the book that is referenced in the story is titled Beyond Hitler’s grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria’s Jews and was written by Michael Bar-Zohar (Not Michael Bar Oar). According to Bar-Zohar, the Bulgarian government came along side of Hitler early in the war because King Boris III hoped it would help him reclaim the lost lands of Greece and Romania.  Hitler demanded that Bulgaria deport its Jews but a combination of forces in Bulgaria prevented that from happening and, according to Bar-Zohar, the Bulgarian Jews were the only Jewish population under the Nazis to actually increase during World War II. The story of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews is not a new one but there has not been agreement of what the role of King Boris III was.  Government documents about the Jews were sealed after World War II by the Communist government.  But Bar-Zohar was able to search the now opened archives and to interview Bulgarian survivors.  He says that the King did play a role along with politician Dimiter Peshev and the Metropolitan Stefen of the Bulgarian Orthodox church.  Their efforts delayed action on deporting Jews from Bulgaria long enough until the war turned against the Nazis.

"," This is a delicate one and could possibly be affected by which history book you read and how you interpret what is there.  The courageous patriots who signed the Declaration of Independence, as well as other of the fathers of our country, deserve all the recognition and honor we can give.  They risked everything to bring this country into being.  This email, however, makes it sound as though the British won, not the Colonists.  We don’t want to diminish the sacrifices each of them experienced.  There were hardships and losses, but to characterize the signers as not having enjoyed the fruits of their project of liberty is to overlook the quality of their abilities and the success of what they did. Here are some of our findings: First, none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence died in captivity.  All but two, or possibly three, died natural deaths and the majority of them lived to advanced age and had adequate possessions if not wealth.  Of the deaths, Thomas Lynch, Jr. was lost at sea on a recreational voyage, Button Gwinett died from injuries in a duel with a political rival, and George Wythe was thought to have been poisoned by a man who wanted his estate, but the man was acquitted.  At least four of the signers were captured by the British, but apparently because they were soldiers, not signers of the Declaration.  We consulted seven sources about the signers and none contained accounts of what could be called torture, at least not that was directed toward any of them for being founding fathers.  Two who were captured may have experienced some kind of torture because of the severity of their confinement, but that is conjecture.  All were released and died natural deaths, although the health of some was affected by their imprisonment.

Here are some of the stories for which there are sources: … In her book “The Spirits of Mindoro” published in 1988 by Overseas Missionary Fellowship, Catherine Davis talks about a woman who worked in the jungle on Mindoro Island in the 1950’s.  She was sleeping alone in her house one night when she heard men outside talking about killing her.  She prayed for protection and the men suddenly grew quiet, then ran away. The next day a woman from the village said that the men did not carry out their plans because of two large people dressed in white who were standing on each side of the path to the house. …Dr. Billy Graham relates a story in his book “God’s Secret Agents” about missionary John Paton and his wife in The New Hebrides.  It is said that one night they were surrounded by hostile natives who wanted to kill them.  They prayed through the night for protection and at daylight, saw that the attackers were leaving.  A year later, the chief of the tribe of the attackers became a Christian and Paton asked him about the night of the attack and why nothing had happened.  The chief was surprised and said it was because of all the men who were there protecting them, hundreds of them in shining garments and with drawn swords. Variations: …The missionary is speaking at his home church in Michigan. …The missionary hears of a planned attack on a village by bandits and gathers everybody in a school building for safety.  The bandits approach the school, but then turn away because they see guards with fiery swords protecting the school.

"The little girl who died and left 57 cents to build a biggerchurch-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hattiemaywiatt/"," The touching story is about a little girl from a poor family who loved attending Sunday School, but there were so many children and the church was so small that she sometimes couldn’t get in.  The later died and the pastor of the church was called to handle her service.  It was discovered that she had been saving money to help pay for a larger church.  It amounted to 57 cents.  That 57 cents became the spark for a series of fund-raising campaigns that resulted in the buildings of Temple Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Temple University, Good Samaritan Hospital, and a large Sunday School building. "," The story of a little girl who left 57-cents for a new church is true, but the version of the eRumor that is circulating has some details thrown in that are not.  The little girl’s 57-cents did inspire the efforts that resulted in the purchase of property and construction of buildings, but did not actually purchase the property outright. A first-hand account of it is in a sermon delivered December 1, 1912 by Russell H. Conwell, pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Philadelphia.  Rev. Conwell said the little girl’s name was Hattie May Wiatt.  She lived near a church where the Sunday School was very crowded and he told her that one day they would have buildings big enough to allow every one to attend who wanted to.  Later, Hattie May Wiatt became sick and died.  Rev. Conwell was asked to do the funeral and the girl’s mother told him that Hattie May had been saving money to help build a bigger church and gave him the little purse in which she had saved 57 cents.  Rev. Conwell had the 57 cents turned into 57 pennies, told the congregation the story of little Hattie May and sold the pennies for a return of about $250.  In addition, 54 of the original 57 pennies were returned to Rev. Conwell and he later put them up on display.  This was in 1886 when 57 cents was no small savings account for a little girl from a poor family.  Some of the members of the church formed what they called the Wiatt Mite Society which was dedicated to making Hattie May’s 57 cents grow as much as possible and to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school.  A house nearby was purchased with the $250 that Hattie May’s 57 cents had produced and the rest is history.  The first classes of Temple College, later Temple University, were held in that house.  It was later sold to allow Temple College to move and the growth of Temple, along with the founding of the Good Samaritan Hospital (Now the Temple University Hospital) have been powerful testimonies to Hattie May Wiatt’s dream.

"Send greeting or business cards to cancer victim Craig Shergold-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/craigshergold/"," An email says that 9-year old Craig Shergold of Carshalton, Great Britain is dying of Cancer.  As a dying wish, he wants to get into the Guinness Book of World Records by collecting the most greeting cards of anybody in history.  The email asks that the cards be sent to an address of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. "," Craig Shergold is real and in 1989 when he was 9-years old, a campaign was started on his behalf to try to break the Guinness world record for greeting cards. The Make-A-Wish Foundation had nothing to do with it, however, and Craig is now a 22-year old young man who is alive and well. The story began in 1988 when Craig first complained of earaches.  Antibiotics didn’t help and one day when his condition seemed desperate, Craig was taken to a hospital for tests, which revealed a brain tumor.  He was so ill his parents were warned he might not survive.  Surgery removed the tumor, but it kept growing and the outlook was not good.   When the staff at Royal Marsden Hospital in London saw how much get-well cards cheered it up, it was suggested that a card project be started to break the Guinness world record.  The London office of the Children’s Wish Foundation (not Make-a-Wish) got on board and the British press gave visibility to the story.  The old Guinness mark was slightly more than a million cards.  That record was broken by Craig within a few months, but the cards kept coming.  Then along the way, the rumor said he wanted business cards, not greeting cards.  The mail load got so heavy that Craig’s family ultimately halted mail delivery to their home and chose to move to a different residence.  Now, Craig’s old address has its own postal code and more than 350 million pieces of mail have been received.  Volunteers remove the stamps, which are sold, and the mail is then recycled, with the proceeds going to cancer research.  The folks at Guinness have retired the greeting card category. Although Craig and his family became overwhelmed by the volume of mail, they ultimately became grateful for one aspect of the visibility.  Word of Craig’s condition reached Virginia billionaire John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia.  He arranged for Craig to be flown to the U.S. for life-saving surgery at the University of Virginia Medical Center. A PAX-TV movie about Craig was the result of producer Robert Woods having received the rumor and sending a card to Craig.  Through that, he learned that Craig was no longer a little boy, but a healthy young man and the story struck him as a good one for the screen.  He and the family have hopes that the film will help quiet the rumor. updated 11/18/01 For more information: Make A Wish Foundation ","Inspirational"

"Cassie Bernall Said “Yes” When Asked about her faith by a shooter at Columbine-Disputed!","2015-03-16 17:08:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cassie/"," Widely circulated reports and emails tell the story of high school student Cassie Bernall being a Christian martyr in the Columbine high school shootings of 1999 in Colorado.  It was reported that one of the killers asked her if she believed in God.  Cassie said, “Yes” and then was then killed. "," There     are witnesses and investigators who say that there was no verbal     exchange about God between Cassie and her killer and that it was     actually a different girl who was near Cassie who was asked about her     belief. During the days following the killings in April of 1999, several of the     students who were in the library where Cassie and others were shot said     she had been confronted by one of the gunmen, Dylan Klebold, and asked     whether she believed in God.  It was reported that she said     “yes” and was immediately shot and killed.  Her story became a spark for spiritual renewal among     many young people around the country and resulted in a best-selling book     written by her mother, Misty Bernall. On September 23, 1999, Salon magazine published an article that     questioned the story about Cassie, which was quickly followed by similar     stories in both the Rocky Mountain News and the Denver Post, two of the     Colorado newspapers who had followed the Columbine killings the closest. An article in the Rocky Mountain News from September 24 quotes chief     investigator John Kiekbusch of the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department     as saying that the question about God may have never been asked of     Cassie.  The News says that Cassie was crouched under a table when     she was shot and that another student, 16 year old Emily Wyant, was next     to her.  Emily survived the ordeal and says she never heard Cassie     asked about belief in God.  She says Cassie was praying and saying,     “Dear God. Dear God. Why is this happening? I just want to go     home.”  In the article, Emily says she does wonder if Cassie     was singled out because of the fact that she was praying.  Klebold     reportedly looked under the table at the girls, said, “Peekaboo,”     then shot Cassie. The News article says that one of the witnesses to initially tell the     story about Cassie being asked about her belief in God was Craig Scott     whose sister Rachel was among those killed in the rampage.  He told     investigators that he heard the exchange about God and thought it was     Cassie’s voice that said “yes,” but he did not actually see     who had said it.  According to the article, Scott was later able to     point to where the gunman was at that time that he heard the exchange, but that he indicated a     table where a different student, Valeen Schnurr, had been hiding.      Schnurr’s mother says Valeen was lying wounded on the library floor and     was praying when one of the gunmen approached her and asked if she     believed in God.  The News article says she replied by saying,     “Yes, I believe in God.”  The gunman did nothing more and     Valeen survived.  The Salon article says Valeen was saying,     “Oh, my God, oh, my God, don’t let me die,” when one of the     gunmen asked her if she believed in God.  She said “yes”     and was then asked why.  She said, “Because I believe and my     parents brought me up that way.”  Salon says that in the end,     the investigators concluded that Valeen’s was the only encounter in the     library where anyone was asked about God.  None of those who     thought the question had been asked of Cassie actually witnessed it,     they only heard it and, it is suggested, heard Valeen’s voice, not     Cassie’s. The News quotes another student who was in the library during the     shootings, Joshua Lapp, as saying he is still sure of his memory of the     event and that Cassie was asked about her belief and did respond by     saying “yes” before she was shot. The editor of Misty Bernall’s book, Chris Zimmerman, says that Cassie’s     mother was candid in the book about the fact that there were differing accounts of what     was said in the library and that the crux of the book is the true story of a     troubled American teen-ager who encountered God and experienced a dramatic change that gave     her the confidence to face both her life and her death.","Inspirational"
