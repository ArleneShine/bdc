"A General Mattis Christmas Story-Truth!","2016-12-05 09:06:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/general-mattis-christmas-story/"," A commentary making the rounds titled “A General Mattis Christmas Story” tells about how President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to serve as Secretary of Defense, Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis personally filled in for an officer on duty so the officer could spend Christmas Day with his young family. "," “A General Mattis Christmas Story” has been correctly attributed to Dr. Albert C. Pierce, the director of the Center for the Study of Professional Military Ethics at the United States Military Academy. Pierce recounted the “General Mattis Christmas Story” story while introducing Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis before a lecture titled “Ethical Challenges in Contemporary Conflict: The Afghanistan and Iraq Classes” at the United States Naval Academy in the spring of 2006. An archived recording of Pierce’s introduction can be heard here . Peirce’s General Mattis Christmas Story was a retelling of a story told by Gen. Charles Kruliak. Kruliak and his wife made and delivered hundreds of Christmas cookies to Marine guard posts in the Washington-Annapolis-Baltimore area each Christmas. One year, while making a cookie delivery to Quantico, Kruliak asked was surprised to find Mattis filling in for the officer in comamnd: …General Krulak said that General Mattis came in, in a duty uniform with a sword, and General Krulak said, “Jim, what are you doing here on Christmas Day? Why do you have duty?” General Mattis told him that the young officer who was scheduled to have duty on Christmas Day had a family, and General Mattis decided it was better for the young officer to spend Christmas Day with his family, and so he chose to have duty on Christmas Day… The General Mattis Christmas story has been circulating in forum posts and forwarded emails as far back as 2010 — but it resurfaced in 2016 after President-elect Trump announced that he would nominate Mattis to serve as secretary of defense.

"Gold Star Family Booed by Passengers on Flight-Truth!","2016-11-21 08:27:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gold-star-family-booed-passengers-flight/"," First class passengers booed the Gold Star Family of a fallen Marine sergeant because they were allowed to deplane first to catch a connecting flight to meet their son’s remains. "," Gold Star father Stewart Perry, an ex-Marine from Stockton, California, said “it was really disgusting” when his family was booed en route to his son’s burial in Arlington National Cemetery. A Taliban suicide bomber killed Sgt. John Perry inside a NATO airbase in Afghanistan on November 12th, 2016. On November 19th, Stewart Perry, his wife and daughter were aboard an American Airlines flight from Sacramento to Philadelphia that was delayed, making a connection in Phoenix hard to manage, the Army Times reports : When the plane arrived in Arizona, the captain announced that everyone was to remain seated to allow the Perry family to leave first. “When he made that announcement, there was some hissing and some booing behind us,” said Perry, who was sitting in first class. Perry, a Marine veteran, doesn’t remember the captain telling everyone the reason they had to wait, but he said he does recall the captain mentioning “military personnel.” “I believe that the passengers knew there was a Gold Star family on board,” he said. “The woman sitting directly behind us touched me on the shoulder and asked if I was the father of the soldier killed in Afghanistan.” That leads Perry to believe some kind of announcement was made before he and his family sat down. “It was very disappointing,” he said. “It’s just enough to put you over the edge.” Stewart Perry said being booed by passengers aboard their flight made his family “cry some more” — but that his goal in going public with the story was to bring attention to his son’s heroic acts, CBS Sacramento reports : “Most importantly, I want people to know about the heroic thing that my son did,” he said. His son stumbled on the suicide bomber before he could reach his target—a soldiers’ 5K Veterans Day run. “He would have killed 100, 200, who knows?” he said. Perry says his son’s death comes at a time military service is facing disrespect. He says his family was even booed on the flight to bring his son’s body home over a delay. “To hear the reaction of the flight being delayed because of a Gold Star family, and the first class cabin booing that was really upsetting, and it made us cry some more,” he said. Seventeen people were killed in the blast that claimed Perry’s life, and 16 more U.S. service members were wounded. ","Military"
"Navy to Name Ship After Harvey Milk-Truth!","2016-08-15 10:29:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/navy-name-ship-harvey-milk-truth/"," The Navy plans to name a ship after gay rights activist Harvey Milk. "," It’s true that the Navy plans to name a ship after Harvey Milk. The U.S. Naval Institute (USNI) first reported on July 28, 2016, that it had learned through a congressional notification that Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus plans to name a Military Sealift command fleet oiler the UNSN Harvey Milk (T-AO-206). Then, on August 11, Mabus issued a press release stating that the ship would officially be named in Milk’s honor in a ceremony held at Treasure Island in San Francisco on August 16: “T-AO-206 will, for decades to come, serve as a visible legacy of Harvey Milk’s committed service to his nation, both as a sailor and as an activist,” Mabus said in a statement given to USNI News. “By adorning one of our ships with his name, his example will live on in the steel of that ship and in all those who will serve aboard her.” Milk joined the Navy after graduating from the New York State College for Teachers in 1951. He served as a diving instructor at a base in San Diego during the Korean War, Biography.com reports . In an earlier announcement , Mabus said that the class of new oilers would be named after civil rights activists. The first ship in the new fleet was named after U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democratic lawmaker from Georgia and longtime civil rights activist. ","Military"
"A Secretary Without Honor by Philip Jennings-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-07-20 11:29:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/secretary-without-honor-philip-jennings/"," Phillip Jennings, a former Marine Corps pilot, recounts how a Marine captain owned up to the mistake of leaving a nuclear codes booklet unsecured in the 1960s, damaging his career, and compared the tale to Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. "," Key details of Philip Jennings’ story about a Marine captain who took responsibility for unattended nuclear codes don’t check out, but we can’t prove with certainty that this one is truth or fiction. Philip Jennings’ column appeared under the headline “Secretary Without Honor” in June. After USA Today published the column in its online op-ed section, the story made the rounds in forwarded emails and discussion forums. Jennings recounts that he was the air liaison officer for a battalion of Marines aboard 11 ships in the Mediterranean in the mid 1960s. As officer and senior captain, Jennings writes, he had a rotating responsibility for a nuclear code book that was kept in the operations room of the lead amphibious squadron ship. Jennings wrote that he shared the responsibility with Captain Leonard F. Chapman III, who was the son of a “high-ranking” Marine. The captain’s father was Gen. Leonard F. Chapman Jr. , the former commandant of the Marine Corps. Jennings writes that Captain Chapman mistakenly left the nuclear code book unattended for “seconds,” and returned to find the operations sergeant looking at the code book. Jennings continues: Against all regulations, the code book had been out of the safe and unattended. It mattered not that it was unattended for only seconds, that the ship was 5 miles at sea, or that it was certain no one unauthorized had seen the code. The captain could have explained this to the operations sergeant. He could have told the sergeant that he “would take care of it.” He could have hinted that his high-ranking dad could smooth it over. But the Marine Corps’ values are honor, courage and commitment. Honor is the bedrock of our character. The young captain could not ask the sergeant to betray his duty to report the infraction, no matter how small. Instead, the captain simply said, “Let’s go see the colonel.” That captain had wanted to be a Marine officer all of his life. It was the only career he ever wanted. When he reported the incident to the colonel, he knew he was jeopardizing his life’s dream. But he did it. The results went by the book. The amphibious squadron stood down. Military couriers flew in from NATO. The codes were changed all over Europe. The battalion was a day late in leaving the Mediterranean. The captain, Leonard F. Chapman III, received a letter of reprimand, damaging his career . He stayed in the corps and died in a tragic accident aboard another ship. I saw some heroic acts in combat in Vietnam, things that made me proud to be an American and a Marine. But that young captain stood for what makes our corps and our country great. Jennings then concluded that Hillary Clinton’s lack of accountability and responsibility in her use of a private email server proved that she was “the antithesis” of that young captain and a secretary without honor. Leonard F. Chapman III died in a scuba diving accident in 1979. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery . His headstone lists his rank as “Major.” ","Military"
"Bad Angel Pilot Lt. Louis E. Curdes Shot Down His Girlfriend in WWII-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-06-28 11:22:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bad-angel-pilot-lt-louis-e-curdes-shot-girlfriend-wwii/"," Air Force Lt. Col. Louis E. Curdes, the pilot of a P-51 Mustang dubbed “Bad Angel,” was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down an American C-47 that his girlfriend happened to be aboard. "," It’s true that Lt. Col. Louis E. Curdes shot down a C-47 that his girlfriend was aboard to prevent it from landing on a Japanese airstrip. But while it’s true that Curdes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the valor he demonstrated in flying a P-51 Mustang with the 95th Fighter Squadron, 82nd Fighter Group, it doesn’t appear that he received the recognition for shooting down an American C-47 in the Pacific (more on that later). A photo of Lt. Col. Curdes sitting in the cockpit of his “Bad Angel” P-51 Mustang in the Philippines’ has fueled the legend that he shot down an American C-47 with his girlfriend aboard. The flag decals below the cockpit are referred to as “kill marks,” and along with flags from all three Axis powers (Curdes was among few pilots to shoot down planes from all three countries) appears an American flag: The photo is genuine. It wasn’t altered, and the American flag wasn’t added using photo-editing software after the fact. This video of Lt. Col. Curdes working on his “Bad Angel” P-51 Mustang shows the same kill marking, and the American flag is among the kill marks on the plan in the video. Legend has it that Curdes shot down an American C-47 as it approached a Japanese landing strip on Batan Island. The plan appeared to be in distress, and Curdes reportedly though that the Japanese had patched up an American flag and didn’t bother to take the American decals off. Upon closer inspection, however, Curdes recognized the numbers on its tail: Curdes figured as he wheeled about to give the visitor a closer look. Then he read a familiar number on the tail. It was the number of one of the “Jungle Skippers.” At this point, the Jap ack-ack, opened up – at Curdes’ P-51 but not at the transport. A quick run of thinking convinced Curdes there was only one thing to do since the plane would be Jap property as soon as it landed, if it was not already. To prevent the plane from landing on the Japanese airstrip, Curdes quickly shot out both of its engines, and the plane glided to a soft landing in the sea. It wasn’t until the next morning that Curdes learned that one of the passengers aboard was a girl that he’d met the night before named Valorie: The next morning before daylight, he and his wingman took off. And they were circling over the survivors when a rescue Catalina arrived to pick them up. Back at base, Curdes learned that the C-47 had been American manned with 12 occupants including two Army nurses. The pilot had become lost during a flight from Art island in the southern Philippines and had been forced to head for the nearest visible strip because of a fuel shortage. Curdes gave a start and a shout when he glanced at the names of the survivors. One of the nurses was the “date” he had been with the night before at Lingayen. The legend goes on to state that three weeks later, Curdes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down the C-47, and that he went on to marry the girlfriend that was aboard the plane that he shot down. The story of Curdes shooting down the C-47 with his girlfriend (and future wife) aboard was researched and retold in the ebook, “ US Army Air Force Pilot Shoots Down Wife ,” by retired Air Force Col. Ken Tollefson. The only detail that differs in Tollefson’s recounting is that military records reported 13 American survivors from the C-47 in the water, while there are 12 in common retellings. And we can use online ancestry records to confirm that Louis Curdes did in fact marry a woman named Valerie. One of the main discrepancies, however, appear to be related to claims that Curdes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down the American C-47. Military records indicate that Curdes received the honor for his service with the 95th Fighter Squadron, 82nd Fighter Group, in the Mediterranean Theater of Action during World War II. However, at the time he shot down the C-47 he had been reassigned to the 4th Fighter Squadron, 3rd Air Commando Group. The incident occurred near Bataan Air Field in the Philippians, which was in the Pacific Theatre. That means he likely was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross specifically for shooting down the C-47, which has been widely reported. So, most details about Lt. Col. Louis Curdes and his “Bad Angel” P-51 Mustang check out, but we’re calling this one “truth and fiction” because of claims about why he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. ","Military"
"Joint Chief of Staff Resignation by Ray Starmann -Fiction!","2016-04-20 09:40:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/joint-chief-staff-resignation-ray-starmann/"," A resignation speech that was supposedly given by Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, who was recently appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Obama, has gone viral. "," There’s no truth to reports that General Joseph Dunford resigned as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in protest over President Obama’s foreign policy decisions. Joseph Dunford was sworn in as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 2015, and he still held the position at the time rumors that “America’s top general resigns” went viral in April 2016. Those rumors started with an essay by Ray Starmann that appeared at Defense Watch on April 9. The essay , which appeared under the headline, “What the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Must Tell the Nation,” was a hypothetical first-person account of what the author believed General Dunford’s resignation should sound like: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, in concern for the lives of current and future US military personnel and to honor those who have gone before, I must speak to the nation today. I’ve called this press conference to announce that I am resigning as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I am retiring after 39 years on active duty, which included combat service in Iraq leading the finest Marines in the world. I am resigning as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and retiring from the Marine Corps for the following reasons: For the last seven years during the Obama Administration: I have watched and remained silent as hundreds of senior officers were forced to resign or were forcibly retired because of their disagreements with the current policies wrecking the military. I have watched and remained silent as people who have never served a day in uniform laid siege to the glorious traditions of the US military. I have watched and remained silent as male ROTC cadets paraded in red high heels, male soldiers conducted physical training wearing pregnancy simulators, combat units dealt with breastfeeding and lactation issues in the field and sensitivity training became the standard operating procedure of the US military. Taken out of context, some were led to believe that these remarks were actually made by General Dunford in his resignation speech. That’s not the case. General Dunford hasn’t resigned, and he didn’t make that speech. In response to the confusion, the author posted a clarification on the story that states, “Since this article’s publication, some have asked if General Joe really made this speech and if he has indeed retired. General Joe did not say these words. I only wish he had.” ","Military"
"41 Senators Block Benefits for Veterans-Truth! & Outdated!","2015-11-23 13:49:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/41-senators-block-benefits-for-veterans-truth/"," There have been reports that 41 senators blocked benefits for veterans by voting against a bill that would have improved medical services for vets. "," It’s true that 41 senators voted against a veteran benefits bill back in 2014. Congress did successfully pass a spending bill that increased funding for veterans programs in September 2015, however. The rumor that 41 senators blocked a veteran benefits bill applies to the failed 2014 bill, not the successful 2015 bill. The failed measure from 2014 was called the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act. The bill would have directed an additional $21 billion to medical services and cost-of-living adjustments for veterans and caregivers over 10 years, the Washington Examiner reports : The bill would essentially offer VA health care services to all veterans, including those who do not have service-related problems and have incomes above current cutoff levels. It would also greatly expand a program that pays caregivers of disabled veterans a monthly stipend. Congress originally passed the measure for veterans of post-Sept. 11 wars; Sanders would expand it to all veterans. The caregivers provision is one of the single most expensive features of the bill, and it was put into the legislation over the objections of the Department of Veterans Affairs itself, which believes it would cost even more than Sanders estimated. Bernie Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont and 2016 presidential candidate, introduced the bill. Sanders posted a video recounting how 41 senators blocked the veteran benefits bill that has been viewed more than 130,000 times on YouTube: The rumor that 41 senators voted against the veteran benefits bill is based on a Senate vote that was held on February 27, 2014. On that day, 41 Republican senators voted against a motion to waive applicable budgetary discipline . The motion was required to fund Sanders’ veteran benefits bill. The 41 senators voted against a motion to waive sequestration, or budget policies that require new discretionary spending to be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. A three-fifths majority was required for the motion to waive budgetary discipline to pass, so it failed. The video posted by Bernie Sanders shows clips of Republican senators (including 2016 presidential hopeful Marco Rubio) discussing how cost issues had led them oppose the motion, and the veteran benefits bill. “I don’t think veterans want their programs to be enhanced if every penny of the money that’s going to enhance those programs is added to the debt of the United States of America,” Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, said on the Senate floor at the time. Marco Rubio said, “This bill has already been debated … It has many good elements in it,” Rubio said. “It also has a cost issue at a time when our nation owes close to $18 trillion. That was the reason why so many on my side of the aisle objected to it, and that’s why I would object to the motion made here today by the senator from Vermont.” So, it’s true that 41 Senators blocked a veteran benefits bill back in 2014. The veteran benefits bill that was passed in September 2015 provides $79.7 billion in discretionary funding for military construction and veterans programs, about $7.9 billion more than in the previous fiscal year, The Hill reports .

"Obama Pulls $2.6 Billion from Vets for Refugees-Fiction!","2015-11-12 12:46:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-pulls-2-6-billion-from-vets-for-refugees/"," President Obama has pulled $2.6 billion from veteran programs and has redirected it toward Syrian refugees. "," President Obama hasn’t pulled $2.6 billion from veteran programs to help support Syrian refugees. That rumor combines two stories that appear to be unrelated. In July 2015 it was reported that the Department of Veteran Affairs faced a $2.6 billion funding gap for the year. But Obama didn’t “pull” the $2.6 billion from veterans programs to support Syrian refugees. The military publication Stars and Stripes explains the $2.6 billion shortfall as such: The VA told lawmakers it is $2.6 billion short on funding because patients and appointments have ballooned over the past year. It wants to cover the shortfall by tapping into an emergency $10 billion Veterans Choice fund created by Congress last summer to provide outside health care to veterans who cannot get timely appointments at the VA. In order to correct the funding gap for veterans’ health care, House Republicans said they would work to allow the VA more flexibility so that it could move funds from other areas of its budget to health care, where it faced the $2.6 billion shortfall. In a separate story, White House press secretary Josh Ernest announced in September 2015 that the U.S. would give an additional $419 million in humanitarian assistance to those impacted by the Syrian civil war before the end of the year, bringing the 2015 total up to $1.6 billion, United Press International reports : The majority of new funding supports non-governmental organizations and the United Nations’ efforts in Syria, mostly through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the UN Children’s Fund. The United States will have given more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian assistance since the start of the Syrian civil war by the fiscal year’s end. “Part of the new funding will respond to the 2015 appeals of $8.4 billion from the United Nations for Syria and the region,” the White House said in a statement. “It is important to note that even with this contribution, the UN appeals for humanitarian aid to address the crisis in Syria are only 38 percent funded, resulting in cutbacks to food and other essential services.” So, the rumor that Obama pulled $2.6 billion in funding for veterans and gave it to Syrian refugees is false. It combines to different (and unrelated) situations. To recap, the VA reported a $2.6 billion funding gap in 2015 because of higher health care costs than expected — not because Obama had “pulled” the funding for Syrian refugees. In response, lawmakers agreed to make the VA’s budget more flexible so that funds could be reallocated from other areas of the budget to cover health care costs. Then, four months later, the White House announced that it would allocate an additional $419 million in humanitarian aid to the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015, bringing the yearly total to $1.6 billion. That money was not drawn from veterans programs, which is contrary to what the rumor claims. ","Military"

Now Resolved!","2015-05-29 11:08:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/major-general-craig-olson-faces-court-martial-for-thanking-god/"," A civil liberties group called for the court martial of Air Force Major General Craig Olson after he thanked god during a speech at a National Day of Prayer Task event. "," It’s true that a civil liberties group called for Air Force Maj. Gen. Craig Olson to face a court martial for thanking god during a public event, but the Air Force declined to punish him. Craig Olson spoke at a National Day of Prayer Task Force event on May 7, 2015. In a video of the address , Olson called himself a “redeemed believer in Christ” and continued: “…Flying complex aircraft; doing complex nuclear missions — I have no ability to do that. God enabled me to do that. He put me in charge of failing programs worth billions of dollars. I have no ability to do that, no training to do that. God did that. He sent me to Iraq to negotiate foreign military sales deals through an Arabic interpreter. I have no ability to do that. I was not trained to do that. God did all of that.” Craig Olson concluded by asking the audience to pray for Defense Department officials and said that they “need to humbly depend on Christ.” The address drew criticism from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation. The group claimed that Greg Olson’s address was a “propaganda bonanza for ISIS” and that Olson had defied Air Force code by “witnessing for Jesus in full uniform on worldwide TV and Internet.” Military Religious Freedom Foundation President Michael Weinstein called for Greg Olson to be “aggressive and very visibly” brought to justice via court martial in an open letter to the Air Force chief of staff. The letter cited a section of the Air Force Instruction that Olson had allegedly violated: “2.12. Balance of Free Exercise of Religion and Establishment Clause: Leaders at all levels must balance constitutional protections for their own free exercise of religion, including individual expressions of religious beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition against governmental establishment of religion. They must ensure their words and actions cannot reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing or disapproving of, or extending preferential treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of belief. (emphasis added) In light of your very own Air Force regulation, irrefutably on point with the matter herein, and the violation of which is proscribed as a potential FELONY under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, do you honestly NOT see any incredibly serious problems here with Olson’s statements, Mark? Please also note the controlling holding of the seminal 1974 Supreme Court case of Parker vs. Levy (417 U.S. 733), penned by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, significantly limiting the Constitutional rights of active duty military members (such as Major General Olson) vs. the same rights enjoyed by their American civilian counterparts. Additionally, Major General Olson has violated the No Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights as well as having constructively created a banned “religious test” in specific contravention of Clause 3, Article VI of the body of the United States Constitution. He is also providing an unlawful endorsement and selective benefit to a non-Federal entity (the NDPTF, which is a private organization), in violation of both the Joint Ethics Regulation (DoD 5500.7-R) prohibition on endorsement of non-Federal entities and DoD Instruction 5410.19, which prohibits the providing of a selective benefit or preferential treatment to any private organization, as well as violating a slew of other DoD directives, instructions, and regulations.” However, an Air Force spokesperson later said Maj. Gen. Olson did not break Air Force Instruction by speaking at the event because he had expressed his own personal views, not the views of the Air Force, the Air Force Times reports . ","Military"

Have you heard what the troops are calling the Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopter Hillary Clinton used on her Iraq tour? ‘Broomstick One'” In 2003, then-Senator Hillary Clinton toured Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan over the Thanksgiving holiday. The New York Times reports that Clinton was received well by the troops: “Senator Clinton received a generally warm reception from members of the military, who are often perceived as conservative and Republican. “After the meal, more than a dozen soldiers formed a line to have their photographs taken with the former first lady. A half dozen asked for her autograph, often inscribed to their daughters.

Claims circulated the web that Clinton’s handlers had forced the unwilling soldier to pose with her for a photo-op, and TruthorFiction.com found that to be true .

"Texas Governor Deploys State Guard to Stave Off Obama Takeover – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-05-06 06:41:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/texas-governor-deploys-state-guard-to-stave-off-obama-takeover/"," Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed the State Guard to prevent a take over of the state by President Obama as a joint military exercise called Jade Helm 15 got underway. "," This claim is a mixture of truth and fiction. It’s true that Texas Governor Greg Abbot asked the State Guard to monitor the Jade Helm 15 joint military training exercise that was planned for Texas and five other states. However, reports that the Texas governor deployed the State Guard to “stave off” a federal takeover by President Obama is false. There has been a lot of speculation that Jade Helm 15 isn’t an innocent military training exercise. Conspiracy theories that claim Jade Helm 15 is actually an attempt to impose martial law, or to take over southern states, have run rampant on the Internet. TruthorFiction.com previously investigated these conspiracy theories about Jade Helm 15, and we didn’t find proof that it’s anyting more than a standard military training exercise. Click here for the story. Controversy about Jade Helm 15 boiled over on April 29, 2015, when 200 Texans raised questions about the exercise at a public meeting held in rural Bastrop County, Texas. Questions were raised about whether or not the government planned to confiscate weapons or impose martial law, the Associated Press reports : “Suspicions about Jade Helm intensified on some conservative websites and social media after a map labeled Texas, Utah and parts of California as ‘hostile’ for the purposes of the three-month training exercise that begins in July. Such war simulations aren’t unusual, though the Army has acknowledged that the size and scope of Jade Helm makes it unique.” In response to the strong public response, Texas Governor Greg Abbot requested in a letter that the State Guard “monitor” the training exercise, Reuters reports : “To address concerns of Texas citizens and to ensure that Texas communities remain safe, secure and informed about military procedures occurring in their vicinity, I am directing the Texas State Guard to monitor Operation Jade Helm 15. During the operation’s eight-week training period from July 2015 to September 2015, I expect to receive regular updates on the progress and safety of the operation. “During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed. By monitoring the operation on a continual basis, the State Guard will facilitate communications between my office and the commanders of the operation to ensure that adequate measure are in place to protect Texans. “U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has assured Texas that each location selected for training exercises will pose no risk to residents or property and that they will coordinate with local residents via verbal and written communication. “Directing the State Guard to monitor the operation will allow Texas to be informed of the details of military personnel movements and training schedules, and it will give us the ability to quickly and effectively communicate with local communities, law enforcement, public safety personnel and citizens.” Abbott states in the letter that the State Guard would primarily help his office and Texans communicate with the planners of Jade Helm 15. However, a report by NPR that appeared under the headline, “Texas Governor Deploys State Guard to Stave Off Obama Takeover,” seemed to fan the flames about a standoff between the White House and Texas. A White House spokesperson said that he had “no idea what (Abbott) was thinking” when he sent the letter: “The thing that I can say without having a lot of detailed knowledge about the particular exercise is that in no way will the constitutional rights or civil liberties of any American citizen be infringed upon while this exercise is being conducted.” Days later, the Texas governor appeared before reporters to defend his decision to have the State Guard monitor Jade Helm 15: “We are playing a pivotal role of government and that is to provide information to people who have questions. It’s clear that people in Bastrop had questions … I frankly think that there was an overreaction to the simple fact that someone has to be in charge of gathering and disseminating information and we stepped in to play that role, which is a role to be applauded. What the letter did was quite simple and non-inflammatory, and I think that’s the way it should be construed.” So, it’s true that Texas Governor Abbot directed the State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15 — but it’s not true that he deployed the State Guard to “stave off” a takeover by Obama.

"Coach K Criticizes President Obama’s Military Strategy-Truth! & Outdated!","2015-04-11 00:01:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/coach-k-criticizes-president-obamas-military-strategy/"," Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski (Coach K) criticized President Obama’s military strategy to deal with the ISIS terrorist group. "," This one is true, but it’s also outdated. Coach K grabbed headlines in September of 2014 when he commented on President Obama’s military strategy while accepting an award at the Association of the U.S. Army conference. The Daily Beast reports that Coach K told the conference: “I know it’s upsetting to many of you when you hear ‘no boots on the ground.’ It upsets me too, because that’s like saying I’m not going to play two of my best players. Because that’s what you are trained to do. And for decades and decades, the fact that we are a free country and we don’t play home games here is a result of having boots on the ground. That’s the problem. “It’s about letting your opponent know we are going to use our best players. And whether we use them or not, that’s up to the coach. You never tell your opponent you are not going to use (them), like I’m not going to play Grant Hill, J.J. Redick, Christian Laettner.” When national media outlets picked up the story in November of 2104, Coach K backed off and said that he didn’t criticize President Obama’s military strategy, the Charlotte Observer reports : “I’m passionate about the United States military and always will be an amazing supporter of the military. On that night nothing was ever said about President Obama, and nothing was ever said about ISIS. In fact, I hate even saying that word. “I do not hate saying the other word because I love President Obama. It’s amazing that it happened three weeks ago and on Election Day something is brought up and said in a way that I didn’t say. So be it.” It’s true that Coach K never specifically said “Obama” or “ISIS” in his remarks, but it seems obvious where his remarks were aimed. At the time, the term “ boots on the ground ” was at the center of national debate about the U.S. response to ISIS. This eRumor first appeared in 2014, and it reappeared after Duke won the NCAA national championship in 2015. Some were led to believe that Coach K made the comments after the national championship game, but that wasn’t the case. ","Military"

"," It’s true that a man named John Edwin Roberts, who identifies himself as a former Navy SEAL, wrote the “Battling Boys of Benghazi” poem. The poem first appeared in San Diego Beach Life Magazine under the title “Battling Bastards of Benghazi” shortly after the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi in 2012. It was inspired by a poem written during World War II. Frank Hewlett wrote “ The Battling Bastards of Bataan ” about American men who died while being held prisoner by the Japanese at Camp O’Donnell. The poem goes: “We’re the battling bastards of Bataan; No mama, no papa, no Uncle Sam. No aunts, no uncles, no cousins, no nieces, No pills, no planes, no artillery pieces. And nobody gives a damn. Nobody gives a damn.” Emails with the “Battling Boys of Benghazi” poem usually say that the author is unknown, or that it is by Col. William Bauer. Both of those claims are wrong. John Edwin Roberts wrote the poem about two former Navy SEALS who were killed in the Benghazi attack. Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were working as SEALs contractors in Libya at the time and rushed to defend the consulate, CNN reports .

"," It’s true that crosses are regularly placed at Santa Barbara Beach to memorialize fallen soldiers, but it’s not true that the ACLU has sued to have them removed. The group Veterans for Peace places the crosses at Stearns Warf in Santa Barbara every Sunday from sunrise to sunset. The project has become known as “Arlington West,” and its goal is to: “Remember the fallen and wounded, to acknowledge the human cost of war, to provide information about the domestic costs of a permanent war economy, to encourage dialogue among people with varied points of view, to educate the public about the needs of those returning from war, and to provide a place to grieve.” Veterans for Peace, the group that organizes Arlington West, says it works to “build a culture of peace” by using the experiences and voices of veterans of war. Reports that the ACLU had sued to have the crosses removed from the beach in Santa Monica first cropped up in 2011, but such a lawsuit was never filed. This eRumor likely confuses previous reports of ACLU lawsuits regarding the removal of crosses from government lands and monuments. In 2001, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the National Parks Service to have a large cross removed from the Mojave National Preserve in San Bernardino, California. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against the ACLU in that case. And a variation of this eRumor is that the ACLU has sued the government to have all crosses removed from military cemeteries. The group has said that this is a myth : “The ACLU does NOT want to remove crosses from federal cemeteries. To the contrary, we have fought to expand the right of veterans and their families to decide for themselves which religious symbols, if any, mark the military graves of those who served and died for our country.” TruthorFiction.com previously covered the eRumor that the ACLU wants all cross-shaped headstones removed from military cemeteries.

"Chaplain Says Officials Ordered Him To Cover Christian Symbols In VA Chapel-Truth!","2015-03-30 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/va-covers-religious-symbols/"," The Veterans Administration (VA) ordered that Christian symbols and statutes in a chapel at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, be covered when the chapel was not being used for Christian services. "," It’s true that Christian symbols were once covered by a curtain when Christian services were not being held in the chapel at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC, but that policy is no longer in place. The story went viral in the spring of 2014 after a number of news outlets reported that the VA facility in Iron Mountain was not in compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that requires houses of worship to be nonsectarian. The story went viral again in early 2015, so TruthorFiction.com followed up with staff at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC for an update. Bradley Nelson, the public affairs director at the facility, told TruthorFiction.com that the curtain was temporarily used to meet requirements outlined in the VA’s Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures that were issued in 2008. The policy states that the VA must “uphold the free exercise of religion by all medical, domiciliary, and nursing home patients in the health care facility.” “In keeping with this, it has been long standing policy that VA chapels not reflect any one denomination or faith when not being used for specific faith services or activities,” Nelson said. “This allows for our patients and their families who do not identify with the Christian faith to use the room for prayer, meditation or reflection according to their faith tradition. We were coming into compliance with this policy last spring and the person responsible for the Chapel thought the curtain would be the easiest way to do this, i.e., open it for chapel services and close it when not being used. Based on constructive feedback and what other VA medical centers have done, the curtains were taken down.” But VA medical facilities must still comply with the Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures. Today, Christian symbols are allowed in the main chapel while Protestant and Catholic services are being held, as well as 24/7 in the Holy Sacrament room located inside the chapel, Nelson said. “We have the smaller Holy Sacrament Room, which is dedicated solely to Christian worship and includes the crucifix, statues of Jesus and Mary, Stations of the Cross, Holy Water, stained glass windows, and other accoutrements found in churches, all of which remain in place 24/7,” Nelson said. “The room is available for anyone wishing to use it.” And there aren’t any specific directives that prohibit the use of scripture or religious items like the crucifix and statues of Jesus and Mary during worship services in the main chapel — but they can’t remain there 24/7. “These religious items are put away between chapel services, however, they are accessible for any group or individual wishing to use them in the chapel for their own prayer, meditation or worship,” Nelson said. Several versions of the Holy Bible and Catholic Rosaries are also available in the chapel. Nelson also provided a number of photos of the Oscar G.

"ISIS Released a “Kill List” of U.S. Armed Forces Members-Truth!","2015-03-29 17:29:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/isi-released-a-kill-list-of-us-armed-forces-members/"," The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group has released a “kill list” with the names, photos and home addresses of military personnel who participated in attacks against IS. "," This one is true. The kill list was released by a branch of the IS terrorist group (also known as ISIS and ISIL) that identified itself as the Islamic State Hacking Division in mid-March of 2015. The list had names, photos and home addresses of 100 military members, and it encouraged IS supporters to kill them on U.S. soil, Marine Corps Times reports . The Pentagon said that each military member on the list had been notified and was encouraged to “tighten up” their online privacy settings and social media accounts, NBC News reports . Authorities in Flagler County, Florida, were on alert after the FBI notified them that a number of the people on the so-called kill list lived in the area. Sheriff James Manfre said he had ordered extra patrols, WJXT Jacksonville reports : “I mean this is startling information to have and obviously they are concerned about their loved ones but again, we do not see it as a credible threat. We do not want to allow ISIS to spread terror in our community, yet we are going to make sure that we remain vigilant and let them understand that you fight one of us, you fight all of us,” Manfre said. Now, the biggest question is how IS supporters were able to get the names, photos and home addresses of military personnel that took part in attacks against the terrorist group. Admiral Cecil Haney, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, was asked during a press briefing whether IS had the ability to launch cyber attacks to get that information, Haney answered: “Well, I think you have seen our outfits, like IS and ISIL, various other organizations, as you look at the list of different cyber activities that have occurred. And clearly in the case of that group, being able to use it to recruit, use cyber to threaten and those kind of things —- so we see more and more sophistication associated with that. “This is something that we look at very, very closely. U.S. Cyber Command as well as our interagency team are working this piece. And, quite frankly, it is looked at on a day-to-day basis. “ I would just say, you know, they were — wherever they got that information, it didn’t come from Department of Defense’s networks, quite frankly. It’s unfortunate. And, quite frankly, the safety and welfare of the joint military forces and particularly the people I lead is very important, going forward. “So we do have a campaign where we practice and train on operational security, but not just with the members, but also alert the families, in terms of this business of using social media.” NBC News reports that IS may have gotten the information from public websites, not through cyber attacks. Pentagon public affairs websites reportedly posted the names and photos of 66 of the people on the list with job descriptions like “bomb squadron commander.” ","Military"

"," The story is true and is posted on an official U.S. Air Force web page on the Internet.  On August 16, 1960 Captain Joe Kittenger became the first man to freefall back to earth from an altitude of close to 20 miles. The environment was so harmful at 102,800 feet that Kittenger had to wear a pressurized suit with layers of insulation to keep him alive in temperatures as low as -94°F in the vacuum of space. At any elevation above 62,000 feet a man’s blood would literally boil because of the extremely low atmospheric pressure. Kittenger’s freefall descent lasted about 4 minutes and he reached a speed in excess of 600 miles an hour, faster than the speed of sound. At 18,000 feet he deployed his parachute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The total time of his voyage back to Earth was 13 minutes, 45 seconds. Kittenger continued his military career commanding the 555 Tactical Fighter Squadron and flying an F-4 Phantom Jet during the Viet Nam war. Shortly after shooting down an enemy MiG-21 aircraft Kittenger was shot down and captured on May 11, 1972. He was held at the “Hanoi Hilton” as a prisoner of war for 11 months.

The message says one of the planes was going too fast but slowed and changed altitutej to barely miss hitting the other. "," We contacted the Thunderbird office. Staff Sgt. Katherine Garcia, chief of media relations for the Thunderbirds says the picture is real but is not showing the planes accurately and that the comment in the message about the picture are fabricated. She says the picture was taken from a ground perspective that results in the planes appearing to almost collide but that in reality they were 500 feet apart. She says the bottom plane was actually going straight down and the top plane was gaining altitude. She adds that the Thunderbirds have procedures for calling a “knock-off” to the maneuver if any of them feels that they are too close for comfort and they simply go opposite directions from each other for sake of safety. A Thunderbird ground observer is on duty during each performance and can also call for a knock-off if anything looks amiss from the ground. Sgt. Garcia says the picture has been circulating on the Internet for quite a while but is, in reality, a snapshot from a normal Thunderbirds performance and that there was no danger. Last updated 2/15/04 This is the way the picture is shown with the eRumor. The planes appear to have gotten in each other’s way and are dangerously close to colliding. In reality, according to the Thunderbirds, the plane with the speed brakes deployed (those flap-looking devices on each side of the tail) was going toward the ground while the other was climbing. The plane going down is closer to the camera than the one going up. If we look closely, the wingtip of the climbing plane is behind the nose of the descending plane. If this were a video, we’d see the descending plane pass downward but in front of the plane behind it. ","Military"
"Pictures of the sound barrier-Disputed!","2015-03-25 21:41:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/soundbarrier/"," This email features a picture of an F-18 jet fighter flying through a cloudy circle of what is said to be visible evidence of breaking the sound barrier.  The story says the photo was taken by Ensign John Gay when the plane swished past the U.S. aircraft carrier Constellation at 750 miles per hour. "," Ensign Gay is real and he did take the picture.  There is controversy among people who have seen the picture, however, as to whether it is authentic.  Some observers say that what Ensign Gay has photographed is not a breaking of the sound barrier, but a different phenomenon involving a combination of the aerodynamics of the airplane, the atmospheric pressure, and the temperature.  Also, Ensign Gay says he took the picture at the moment he heard the sonic boom.  Critics have said that is not likely since the plane was flying faster than sound, so any sonic boom would have been heard after the plane passed. To get a professional perspective on this, TruthOrFiction.com turned to Professor James R. Frysinger of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University/College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina and who served in the United States Navy.  He says such pictures can be authentic and explains why.  He also describes why the person taking a picture of a supersonic jet would indeed hear a sonic boom even if the jet had exceeded the sound barrier long before arriving at the photographer’s location: Dr. Frysinger wrote: The explanation A conically shaped high pressure surface is formed by objects traveling faster than the speed of sound in a medium, e.g., a jet flying through the air. This cone is caused by the sound source (jet) traveling faster than the sound waves that are produced by it can travel. The result is an “envelope” of overlapping circles (“sound wave crests”), each with its center lying ahead of the last sound crest. That envelope is conically shaped with its point at the actual sound source. Lying just inside this conically shaped sound pressure wave (above ambient pressure) is a similar, conically shaped surface of below-ambient pressure air (“sound wave trough”). This is a necessary result of the wave nature of sound waves. Any decent physics text will have a sketch of this. If the humidity level is high enough (e.g., just above sea surface on a warm Pacific Ocean afternoon), the humidity in the air may condense in that trough of low pressure and form a cloud, only to be reabsorbed by the air when pressure returns to normal. Such clouds tend to form on the noses, nacelles, an leading egdes or tips of wings, canards, etc. These are not unlike contrails except that the water vapor is present in the air before the jet passes, as opposed to being the result of burning jet fuel. The sonic “boom” Pictures of these show the result of moisture condensing in the conically shaped wave trough just behind the shock wave. The sonic “boom” reported with these events is NOT caused at the time the jet’s speed rises past the speed of sound. It is in fact the continuous sound that the shock wave “crest” represents. A person farther down the path of the jet will hear the same “boom” but later than a person nearer the jet’s direction of approach. The speed of the sound crest is equal to the speed of the jet in the direction of travel and equal to the speed of sound perpendicular to the cone’s surface. The movie clip on my website at www.cofc.edu/~frysingj/fs14ss.mpg shows the jet approaching and at that moment it has not yet been heard by the observer. Many of the stills being passed around are single frames from similar video clips; the camera was rolling before the “boom” was heard. A personal account I was fortunate during my last tour of duty to be standing atop a building at the end of the main runway at NOB Norfolk, a large naval base during a show by the Navy Blue Angels. My height above ground was equivalent to being on the fourth floor, but I was on top of it and “in the elements”. The announcer let us know that a jet was coming in at a supersonic speed and would pass at that speed down the length of the runway and “very close to the deck”. I saw it coming and aimed my camera slightly downward to its altitude and then tripped the shutter on my tripod-mounted camera as it went by. Immediately, I was blown over backwards and my camera and its tripod landed on top of me. The sequence–all in a fraction of a second–was click, boom, thud. Having been alerted I didn’t need to “wait for the boom” to tell when to take the picture. And since the shock wave is NOT a momentary phenomenon, I could let my eye judge when he would be “dead ahead”. All this happened so fast that it seemed for a moment to be simultaneous, but that was an illusion. Yes, I got the picture, looking slightly down into the cockpit and with a clear view of the pilot. Humidity levels that day were too low for a contrail-type cloud to form as they did in the movie clip cited above. The technical explanation The geometry works out such that the sine of the apex half-angle (half the angle at the point of the cone) is equal to the ratio of the speed of sound in air of that temperature, pressure, and humidity to the jet’s speed. That speed ratio is called the Mach Number. So, sin(theta) = V/v or sin(theta) = 1/(Mach Number) where v is the speed of the jet, V is the speed of sound at that location, and theta is half the angle made at the point of the cone. Notice that if the speed of the jet equals the speed of sound, the “cone” is actually a flat surface perpendicular to the direction oftravel. If the jet’s speed is less than the speed of sound, theequation is not valid; there IS no superposition of crests taking place(although there is a large pressure build up, similar to a bow wave ona ship).

"," The USS New York is one of several ships in the San Antonio class of amphibious transport dock ships. They are designed to transport and land troops, supplies, and equipment such as amphibious vehicles and helicopters. Designated as LPD. It is one of three similar ships that are being built and being given names that are associated with The Attack on America.  In addition to the USS New York, the USS Arlington will be named because of the location of the Pentagon, which was hit by American Airlines flight 77.  The USS Somerset will be named after the county in Pennsylvania in which United flight 93 crashed after being taken over by hijackers. The ship is being built in New Orleans.  Twenty-four tons of steel from the World Trade Center have been recycled for the project.  About seven tons were melted down and poured into a cast to make the bow section of the ship’s hull.  The steel has been treated with reverence by the ship builders and several workers have postponed retirements for the honor of working on the USS New York. According to Naval records, several other ships have carried the name the USS New York. This new ship got the name the USS New York when New York governor George Pataki wrote to Secretary of the Navy Gordon England and requested that the Navy approve of the name in honor of the victims of September 11 and on ships that will be used to fight the war on terror. The first was an armed gondola built by Revolutionary War General Benedict Arnold in 1776.  She was one of several ships later burned to avoid capture. The second was a frigate built in New York and commissioned in 1800. She she saw service in the Mediterranean in the war against the Barbary Pirates.  She was in the Washington Navy Yard where she was burned by the British in 1814. The next New York was built after the war of 1812 as part of 9 ships of the line to discourage a future war with Britain.  The threat lessoned so she was never launched but she was burned by Union Forces to avoid capture at the start of the Civil War. The fourth was a screw sloop that was built beginning in 1863 but also never got launched. The fifth was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1893.  She was used in the Spanish-American war and was the flagship of the admiral in the Battle of Santiago, which destroyed the Spanish fleet.  She was later renamed the Saratoga and then later the Rochester. The sixth was the battleship USS New York, commissioned in 1914. She saw service in World War I and World War II.  She was used in the atomic testing in Bikini but survived without sinking.  She was sunk off Pearl Harbor in 1948 as a target ship.

"FEMA Corps Team Members Are the Modern Day Hitler Youth-Fiction!","2015-03-23 21:40:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fema-corps-hitler-youth/"," This is a forwarded email that contains an article that compares a group of American youths who recently graduated from the FEMA Corps program to Hitler Youth.  The email also alleges that the Department of Homeland Security is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition. "," The origin of the eRumor comes from an October 7, 2012 article from the Whiteout Press but these are the ramblings of someone who appears to know very little about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and World War II history of Nazi Germany. According to their website, FEMA Corps is a program that creates a pool of trained team members ranging from ages 18 to 24 to assist in disaster recovery.   The mission of this program is to establish a unit of 1,600 service corps members dedicated to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The benefit of this program is to prepare participants “for careers in emergency management and other related fields, building depth in the emergency management community.”  The first 480 members began training in August 2012 and became ready for deployment in September 2012.  The next training program begins in Winter 2013. FEMA Corps members are compensated for their time. According to the FAQ on their website, “FEMA Corps members receive a living allowance of approximately $4,000 for the 10 months of service (about $200 every two weeks before taxes), housing, meals, limited medical benefits” and members can receive up to an additional $400 a month for childcare.   After the first 10 month term of service there is an option to extend for a second year. Comparison to Hitler Youth Hitler Youth were created in the 1920’s and targeted boys and girls from the ages of 10 to 18. It began as a voluntary program but in 1936, after Adolf Hitler came into power the program became compulsory.   According to the Historylearingsite , the “task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service. For girls, the organization prepared them for motherhood.”    Members of FEMA Corps do not fall into to this age range nor are they trained or prepared for the military. The photo in the forwarded email depicting a young team of FEMA Corps members fully armed and ready to respond is inaccurate. According to a May 13, 2009 article in the New York Times the group in the photo are Explorer Scouts in a simulated counter terrorism training exercise, which occurred in California’s Imperial County under the leadership of local law enforcement and Border Patrol. The article said, “The Explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence — an intense ratcheting up of one of the group’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.” DHS Armament? The writer of the eRumor also alleged that the DHS is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition.  The DHS oversees agencies that conduct  law enforcement, military missions, and immigration enforcement. In a February 14, 2013 article by Fox News , it was disclosed that DHS training centers have used as much as 15 million rounds annually for training exercises and practice on shooting ranges. The article also said that the DHS plans to purchase 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling it “the federal government’s second largest criminal investigative agency.” But ICE is not the only armed agency under the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Secret Service, the intelligence agency that was originally under the Department of the Treasury has the responsibility of protecting the President and dignitaries.  This agency has been under the blanket of the DHS since March 1, 2003.   One agency under the DHS that could be considered to be a major user of weapons and ammunition is the United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is on loan to the DHS from the Department of Transportation and has enough fire power to protect U.S. ports, chase and apprehend pirates and smugglers and assist in the protection of our military assets and facilities in the Persian Gulf. The USCG lists 212 aircraft, various vessels ranging in boats from 18 feet to 47 feet along with a fleet of cutters ranging from 65 feet to 179 feet.  The USCG also performs search and rescue for mariners in peril on the water. The USCG H-65 Dolphin helicopter in the photo above is usually armed with Single 7.62mm M240B/H machine gun, a 7.62mm shoulder-fired precision weapon and a .50-caliber shoulder-fired precision weapon. USCG Cutter Stratton pictured above is one of the newest ships in the fleet can carry USCG Helicopters and has an armament of 57mm Bofors Gun, 1 Phalanx, a CIWS 1B 20mm, four 50 caliber machine guns, as well as two M240B light machine guns.  The cutter is also capable of launching 25 Foot Defender Class Boats with gun mounts both forward and aft. Other agencies under the DHS, according to their organizational chart , are U.S. Customs & Boarder Protection, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services, U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service, and Transportation Security Administration.   Each agency has members who carry and are trained to use weapons. Special Armored Vehicles The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV or “Humvee”) are real and some agencies receive training on these armored vehicles designated for Special Response Teams by the DHS.  The above photo shows members of  U.S. Immigrations & Customs Enforcement in a special training exercise involving armored vehicles. Also, FEMA is the training agency for first responders from the local level to agencies under the DHS.   So that all agencies speak the same language at the scene of a disaster the Incident Command System was developed for all levels of government as well as private sector and by many nongovernmental organizations. updated 2/14/13 ","Military"

It’s set to be held in seven southwestern states from July to September of 2015, according to unclassified documents : “(Jade Helm) is a challenging eight-week joint military and interagency (IA) Unconventional Warfare (UW) exercise conducted throughout Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. “(Jade Helm) is a USSOCOM sponsored exercise to improve the Special Operations Forces’ UW capability as part of the National Security Strategy.” Elite military units like the Green Berets and Navy SEALS will take part in the exercise, along with local officials that are invited to participate. The documents explain that much of the exercise will be held in Texas: “The USSOCOM has conducted numerous exercises in Texas because Texans are historically supportive of efforts to prepare our soldiers, airmen, marines and sailors to fight the enemies of the United States. “To hone advanced skills, the military and interagency require large areas of undeveloped land with low population densities with access to towns. The proposed areas offer the conditions conducive to quality training because of real obstacles to challenge joint and interagency personnel during planning and execution of their tasks.” Thomas Mead, the operations planner for Jade Helm 15, offered more information about the training exercise when asked commissioners in Goliad County, Texas, for permission to move forward, mySouTex.com reports : “This allows our soldiers to get a better training environment,” Mead said. “You can only do so much in a military environment. You don’t really get a true interaction with the public. “We have Army Green Berets, Navy Seals, Marine Special Operations Command, the 82nd Airborne Division and we also have some of our interagency partners such as the DEA, FBI and the joint personnel recovery agency that will be working with us. “We’re getting these guys back into the woods,” Mead said. “We’re getting them back into the field to make it hard for them.” Mead said that neighbors in the area could expect to see an increase in air traffic at night, and that the exercise may result in noise complaints. Mead added that some of the participants would have weapons with blank ammunition and would be wearing civilian clothes. A video posted on YouTube titled, “Red Dawn and the New World Order” fueled speculation about the Jade Helm 15 exercise. In the video , a narrator reads through planning documents and encourages viewers to speculate about what each page could mean. Speculation aside, there’s no proof that Jade Helm 15 is anything more than a normal military training exercise. TruthorFiction.com has reached out to military officials for more information about the Jade 15 exercise. Future updates will be posted here. ","Military"
"Amateur Divers Find Long-Lost Nuclear Warhead-Fiction!","2015-03-19 17:14:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/amateur-divers-find-long-lost-nuclear-warhead/"," Amateur scuba divers found a nuclear warhead in Wassaw Sound off the coast of Georgia. "," Amateur divers did not find a nuclear bomb off the coast of Georgia, but this eRumor is based on real events. The eRumor surfaced after the fake news website World News Daily Report ran a story that claimed tourists from Canada had found a Mark 15 thermonuclear bomb that had been lost by the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s: “The federal and state authorities were well-aware that a nuclear warhead had been lost in the area in the 1950′s and had never been recovered, but no efforts had been done for years to recover it. It was lost on the night of February 5, 1958, when a B-47 Stratojet bomber carrying the 7,600-pound hydrogen bomb on a simulated combat mission off the coast of Georgia collided with an F-86 Saberjet fighter at 36,000 feet of altitude. The collision destroyed the fighter and severely damaged a wing of the bomber, leaving one of its engines partially dislodged.” The fake story duped many readers, and it was shared more than 25,000 times on social media. But World News Daily Report isn’t a trustworthy news source. The website’s disclaimer says that it assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” But like most fake news stories, this one is based on actual events. A history buff named Derek Duke heard stories about an atomic bomb that was supposedly dropped near Georgia in 1958 and looked up the pilot of the plane, Howard Richardson, the Associated Press reports : “Slowly, Richardson began to share his story — first with Duke and later with the Associated Press. “It was Feb. 5, 1958, and he was a major at the controls of a B-47 bomber — one of a dozen from the 19th Bombardment Wing taking off on a training mission from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. All were carrying H-bombs. “At the time, it was routine for crews in training to carry transportation-configured nuclear bombs, with the detonation capsules removed to prevent a nuclear explosion, the Air Force said. The idea was simple. It gave the crews the opportunity to practice with the bomb, said Billy Mullins, associate director of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency.” Richardson said he lost an engine during the training exercise and was instructed to drop the bomb into the ocean because landing with it on a rough runway would have been too risky. Navy divers searched for the bomb for months, but it was never found. Later, the Air Force said that it was not an active nuclear bomb, the Associated Press reports : “As Duke was learning all of this, he turned up a copy of the Atomic Energy Commission receipt Richardson had signed. Written in ink near the top of the document was the word ‘simulated.’ That, according to the Air Force, meant the bomb, containing 400 pounds of conventional explosives and an undisclosed amount of uranium, did not have a detonation capsule. Without it, there was no risk of a nuclear explosion.” But Richardson gave conflicting reports about whether or not the atomic bomb had a detonation capsule over the years, so that has caused some to speculate that an active atomic bomb is still lost somewhere off the coast of Georgia. Conspiracy theories about the lost bomb are likely to persist — but amateur divers definitely did not find it. A photo of a scuba diver posing under water with a bomb that ran with the fake news story was actually taken in the Baltic Sea. The bomb was an unexploded relic from World War II, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports : “In 1943, during a British air raid on a German military site, thousands of bombs were dropped on the port village of Peenemünde. Many of these were bombs that contained phosphorus and about 40 percent missed their target and landed in the sea. They have been rotting beneath the water ever since. About 65 bombs are discovered on Germany’s coastlines each year.” These lost bombs are not atomic, but they can explode and cause injuries. They also leak toxic gas into the sea. ","Military"

"Butch and Eddie O’Hare-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:38:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/butchandeddie/"," Butch O’Hare, the war hero after whom Chicago’s O’Hare airport is named, was the son of mob lawyer Eddie O’Hare.  The email tells the story of Butch O’Hare’s bravery as well as a decision of conscience on the part of his father that may have contributed to his character. "," Lt. Commander Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare is the subject of many articles that document his outstanding service as a pilot during World War II.  He was presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions against the Japanese and defending the U.S.S. Lexington.  According to the official citation of his Medal of Honor , he won the recognition “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat…”  It says he was the section leader of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942.  According to an article on aviation-history.com , six Wildcats were sent into the air to protect the Lexington from Japanese bombers.  O’Hare and his wingman spotted the enemy planes first.  The wingman’s guns jammed, however, and the other four planes were too far away, so O’Hare faced 9 twin-engine Japanese bombers alone.  He shot down five of them and damaged a sixth before other U.S. fighters arrived.  No enemy bombs made it to the Lexington.  The Medal of Honor citation calls it “…one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation…”  O’Hare was killed in November of 1943 during the battle for the Gilbert Islands in the South Pacific.  He was accidentally shot down by another American plane during a night mission.  It is true that Chicago’s O’Hare airport is named after him and there is a restored airplane on display there similar to the one that O’Hare flew. Butch’s father, Eddie O’Hare, was an attorney and business partner of the famous gangster Al Capone.  He helped run Capone’s horse and dog track operation in Chicago.  He was described as being devoted to his son.  There was a point when Eddie decided to secretly become an informant for the Internal Revenue Service and it was with his help that the government convicted and imprisoned Capone for income tax evasion.  Some have said that Eddie became an informant because of a change of heart and a desire to go straight.  Others have said it was merely his way of saving his neck in the face of potential prosecution.  It was an article in Collier’s magazine in 1947 about Eddie O’Hare’s work as an informant that helped win public favor for him and the eventual naming of Chicago’s airport after his war-hero sun.   The article was written by Frank J. Wilson, the Treasury Department investigator with whom O’Hare had worked on the case.  The article was titled “Undercover man: he trapped Capone.”  Wilson called O’Hare one of his best undercover men.

"The Pentagon was not struck by a hijacked jet on September 11-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pentagoncrash/"," The allegation  is that the destruction at the Pentagon on September 11 was not the result of being hit by a hijacked American Airlines 757, but some other cause.  The theories range from the building being hit by a remote-control U.S. fighter jet to being damaged by a truck bomb. "," There are numerous sites that promote the notion that the U.S. government is covering up the true cause of the Pentagon destruction on September 11, but the main one is from France at http://www.asile.org/citoyens/numero13/pentagone/erreurs_en.htm In large headline, it asks the reader to “Hunt the Boeing,” referring to the American Airlines Boeing 757 that plunged into the Pentagon. The site is a part of speculation by conspiracy theorists and includes a book published in France by Thierry Meyssan titled “The Frightening Fraud.”  In it, the author contends that flight #77 did not end by crashing into the Pentagon and that the whole thing is part of a government plot and cover-up.  Meyssan says it doesn’t make sense to him that there aren’t any airplane pieces left over from the crash and that the Pentagon did not immediately fall from the impact. The website asks several questions, which we will deal with in order. 1.  “The Associated Press first reported that a booby trapped truck had caused the explosion.” If this AP report was made, TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find it and none of the sites that makes reference to it lists a source.  Conflicting reports are common during breaking stories and if someone did speculate a truck bomb, that theory quickly disappeared. 2.  “Can you explain how a Boeing 757- 200, weighing nearly 100 tons and travelling at a minimum speed of 250 miles an hour only damaged the outside of the Pentagon? ” First, the Pentagon suffered extensive damage to more than just the outside. CLICK HERE TO SEE CHART Also, the portion of the Pentagon where the plane hit was probably the most heavily reinforced.  In the October 3, 2001 edition of Architecture Week, B.J. Novitski wrote that the impact of the plane was in “Wedge One,” which had been strengthened by recent renovation, a project that was inspired, in part, by the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He says that contrary to what is believed, the casualties among workers in the Pentagon were not low because of vacant offices, but because of the extraordinary structural strength of the building.  Novitski says that about 80 percent of the workers in the wedge were on duty that day, but …”the exterior walls had been reinforced with steel beams and columns, bolted where they met at each floor. Some of these reinforced walls very near the point of impact remained in place for a half hour before collapsing, allowing uncounted hundreds to escape.”  The hijackers chose one of the most reinforced buildings in the world to crash into. 3.  ‘Can you explain how a Boeing 14.9 yards high, 51.7 yards long, with a wingspan of 41.6 yards and a cockpit 3.8 yards high, could crash into just the ground floor of this building?’ Eyewitnesses to the crash as well as video from a security camera at the Pentagon show that the plane struck at ground level.  Considering the description of the strength of the building (above), it is not surprising that the weaker appendages of the plane such as the tail and the wings would not have had as much of an impact as the main body. 4.  “Can you explain why the Defence [sic] Secretary deemed it necessary to sand over the lawn, which was otherwise undamaged after the attack?” According to the article in Architecture Week, it was for a gravel bed that provided a road for large trucks to have access to the crash site. 5.  “Can you explain what happened to the wings of the aircraft and why they caused no damage?” Same answer as in #3.  Photographs show indentations where the stronger, inner portions of the wings may have made impact, but the farther out towards the tips of the wings and the tail, the less they would have had effect. 6.  “Can you find the aircraft’s point of impact? We’re not sure what this question is supposed to mean.  There are plenty of pictures that show clearly where the airplane hit the building.  For some reason, the creators of the website chose two of the pictures that don’t show it clearly.  Dick Bridges, the deputy manager for Arlington County was quoted by AP on September 14, 2001, as saying that both of the “black boxes” for flight #77 were found “…right where the plane came into the building.”  If the recorders didn’t get much beyond that, the plane not only struck the building at that point, but the ground as well.  The cockpit voice recorder was so badly damaged that it didn’t yield any information. Other considerations… 1.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77 that hit the Pentagon, then where is the airplane and the 64 people who were aboard? None of the conspiracy sites answers that question.  Few of them even ask it. 2.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77, then why do they have evidence of the bodies of known crew, passengers, and hijackers? C. Christopher Kelley of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology says that the effort to identify bodies that ended on November 16, 2001, identified all but one of the victims of flight 77. 3.  In response to the question of “Where is the Boeing,” the answer is “in pieces.” There was plenty of evidence of the airplane at the site including debris from the plane, as mentioned above, the remains of the passengers, and the cockpit data and voice recorders.  Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reported on September 13,2001,  that members of congress who had visited the Pentagon crash site were told by rescue officials that much of the fuselage of the Boeing 757 remained intact inside the damaged Pentagon. 4.  Radar tracked the plane toward the Pentagon. Much has been made on some of the conspiracy sites that the transponder in the cockpit was turned off by the hijackers so it isn’t clear what happened to the plane after that.  The founder of TruthOrFiction.com, Rich Buhler, is a licensed commercial pilot and says the transponder being turned off doesn’t mean the plane can no longer be seen on radar.  The transponder is a device that not only makes the airplane more visible on a radar screen, but also gives the radar controller other information such as the altitude, speed, and sometimes the identity of the airliner.  If the transponder is turned off, radar controllers can usually still see what is called the “primary target.”  That means there is a blip on the radar screen showing the location.  According to www.airdisaster.com , flight 77’s transponder was turned off shortly after departure from Dulles airport near Washington DC, but radar controllers could see the primary target flying directly toward the White House.  Then the plane was seen to veer away from the White House and head for the Pentagon.","Military"
"Air Force General Richard Hawley’s comments on the Attack on America-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hawley/"," A series of strongly worded observations about reactions to the Attack on America from a U.S. Air Force General, Richard Hawley. "," General Richard Hawley is now retired, but was most recently the commander of the Air Combat Command, headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.  He is a decorated pilot who flew more than 400 combat missions in Vietnam. TruthOrFiction.com contacted General Hawley and he says he did not write this eRumor that bears his name. He did, however, send us his own comments about the issues that the eRumor addresses: From the real General Richard Hawley: 1) Goodness, Evil and Relativity: There are some really good people in this world. They volunteer to help those who need it, and ask nothing in return. There are also some really bad people in this world. They exploit those who need help, or who have less wit or “charisma”, and motivate them to join in committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against people they don’t even know. Then there are the rest of us. Average people who try each day to do no harm, to provide for their families, to do an occasional act of kindness. The evil that was perpetrated against our land on 9/11 was the product of Mullahs who see our prosperity and power as a threat to their control over the uneducated Muslim masses on whose shoulders they ride through life. And so they preach hate. They are evil. 2) Violence begets violence: It’s true. Violence does beget violence. But sometimes there is no alternative but to confront those who would perpetrate evil acts against us. This is one of those times. We are blessed to have courageous men and women willing to put their lives on the line to track down and annihilate those who have been so imbued with evil as to be beyond redemption. But violence is not a strategy. It is a necessary and fully justified reaction to an unimaginable threat. But it is not a strategy. If we are to win this war, we must defeat the Mullahs. And to defeat the Mullahs, we must find ways to separate them from their uneducated flocks. We cannot kill all those who have been taught to hate us, nor should we wish to. Far better to change their minds than to change their state of being. 3) The intelligence community let us down: Well, maybe just a little. Lots of senior and not so senior intelligence people became just as enamored of high tech gadgets as their political masters. The protests over our evisceration of the human intelligence component of the agency were not very loud or forceful. Keeping spies on the ground is a high risk and often dirty business, and it wasn’t just liberal politicians who didn’t have much stomach for it. 4) Poverty is the breeding ground for terrorists: No, it isn’t; but religious extremism is. The Mullahs fear our wealth and power because it shows that a secular society with democratic institutions and a free market economy can do a better job of taking care of its peoples’ needs, both spiritual and physical, than the oppressive Islamic regimes that they aspire to lead. The Mullahs are the problem, not poverty, but poverty does make it easier for the Mullahs to spread their evil – as do governments that tolerate and even reinforce their hateful message. 5) Profiling: We are at war here! We are not talking about traffic stops. If we were at war with Iceland, I would expect those charged with our defense to pay very close attention to any Icelander who ventured near our shores. In this war I expect them to pay very close attention to Muslims with ties to the places that spew hatred against us. Random checks when there are no such obvious targets available are a good way to keep the evil ones guessing, but let’s not make small children and grandmothers take their shoes off while we watch far more likely candidates walk aboard unchecked. 6) Resolutions: a. Never forget that what happened on September the 11th of 2001 was an act of war. b. Never sit silently by while someone tries to justify what happened on that day as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies in the Middle East or elsewhere. c. Fly our nation’s flag proudly – it represents this world’s greatest hope to move beyond the pain and suffering that inflict so many across the globe. Richard E.

John Kerry was in Vietnam for only four months- Truth! The eRumor, as indicated, is taken from a guest editorial by Vietnam veteran Terry Garlock that was published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on January 29, 2004. Kerry became a vocal critic of the Vietnam war and his image as a boat commander who became a protester made him an anti-war celebrity. He joined Vietnam Veterans Against the War His 1971 book The New Soldier was a collection of his and other anti-war Vietnam veterans writings and pictures. The book became best known, however, because of its cover. It pictured an anti-Vietnam war protest with a American flag flying upside down. Some felt it was mocking the famous picture of the raising of the flag my Marines at Iwo Jima during World War II. During his unsuccessful run for Congress in 1972, critics accused him of having desecrated the flag with the book cover Regarding Kerry’s medals, there was an emotional ceremony on 23, 1971, in which about one thousand veterans who were against the Vietnam war shed their military medals by throwing them over a fence barricade onto the steps of the capitol building in Washington D.C. One of them was John Kerry and it was thought that he had forsaken his Vietnam medals. The 1988 issue of Current Biography Yearbook says that Kerry explained that the medals were not his but those of another veteran who asked him to throw them on his behalf.

"WWII Memorial revises history in Roosevelt quotation-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/wwiimemorial/"," A inscription on the new WW II memorial in Washington DC cites President Franklin Roosevelt’s famous “Day of infamy” quote about the attack of the Japanese on Pearl Harbor in 1941, but leaves out the phrase “So help us God.” "," The eRumor is simply wrong. There is a list of all the inscriptions on the World War II Memorial on the official website at www.wwiimemorial.com .  One of them is from Roosevelt’s “Day of Infamy” speech, but is not the portion quoted in the eRumor. According to the website, this is the inscription: “DECEMBER 7, 1941, A DATE WHICH WILL LIVE IN INFAMY…NO MATTER HOW LONG IT MAY TAKE US TO OVERCOME THIS PREMEDITATED INVASION, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS MIGHT, WILL WIN THROUGH TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.” The inscription uses the first phrase from Roosevelt’s speech then jumps down several paragraphs and draws a sentence from a portion of the speech that does not have any connection to the expression “So help us God.”  That phrase is near the end of the speech in a paragraph that says, “ With confidence in our armed forces – with the unbounding determination of our people – we will gain the inevitable triumph – so help us God.” Yesterday,       December 7, 1941 – a date which will live in infamy – the       United States of America was suddenly and deliberately       attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at       peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was       still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor       looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.       Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced       bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States       and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal       reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated       that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic       negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed       attack. It will be recorded that the       distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack       was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During       the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately       sought to deceive the United States by false statements and       expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the       Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval       and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.       In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the       high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu. Yesterday the Japanese       Government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night       Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong. Last night Japanese forces       attacked Guam. Last night Japanese forces attacked the       Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked Wake       Island. This morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island. Japan has, therefore,       undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the       Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The       people of the United States have already formed their opinions       and well understand the implications to the very life and       safety of our nation. As Commander-in-Chief of the       Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for       our defense. But always will we remember the       character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it       may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the       American people in their righteous might will win through to       absolute victory. I believe       that I interpret the       will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we       will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make       it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again       endanger us. Hostilities exist. There is       no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our       interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed       forces – with the unbounding determination of our people – we       will gain the inevitable triumph – so help us God. I ask that the Congress       declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by       Japan on Sunday, December seventh, 1941 a state of war has existed       between the United States and the Japanese Empire.

"500 Tons of Uranium Yellowcake Moved From Iraq to Canada-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/uraniumyellowcake/"," Various commentaries and news agency reports about radio active concentrates of uranium known as “yellowcake” being secretly transported from Iraq to a base in Canada. "," This eRumor started   circulating in August, 2008. “Yellowcake” (or “yellowcakes”) is a concentrate of uranium that results from the refinement of uranium ore.  It is used for making fuel for nuclear power plants and to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. On July 7, 2008 the American Forces Press Service released a statement of the completion of a classified mission dubbed “Operation McCall” to transfer 500 metric tons of yellowcake at the request of the Iraqi government from Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center near Baghdad to Canada. Click here to read the story posted on the Department of Defense site. According to published reports including CBS news, the United States secretly moved a huge stockpile of yellowcake over a two week period, from Iraq to Canada, partly to keep it from falling into the hands of either terrorists or foreign governments such as Iran. The operation was reportedly more than a year in the making and took three months to execute.  It included carrying 3,500 barrels of yellowcake by road from Baghdad, then flying them on 37 military flights to an atoll in the Indian Ocean, then carrying them aboard a U.S. ship bound for Montreal.  In all, it added up to more than 500 metric tons of material from Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program. The Iraqi government sold the yellowcake to a Canadian uranium company and it will be used in Ontario, Canada, for use in nuclear reactors. A CBS report said, “ And, in a symbolic way, the mission linked the current attempts to stabilize Iraq with some of the high-profile claims about Saddam’s weapons capabilities in the buildup to the 2003 invasion.  Accusations that Saddam had tried to purchase more yellowcake from the African nation of Niger – and an article by a former U.S. ambassador refuting the claims – led to a wide-ranging probe into Washington leaks that reached high into the Bush administration. “ The news report went on to say that the yellowcake “had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War.

"," This eRumor is false, but various versions of it have been circling the Web since 2008. Earlier versions of the eRumor claimed that the fallen soldier’s name was Peter Mallory, and that Mallory was posthumously awarded the Silver Medal for his courageous service. Those claims were likely removed from the latest versions of the eRumor because they can easily be proven false. A Washington Post database of all the soldiers who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan does not include anyone named Mallory. The name “Mallory” also does not appear in a database operated by the website HomeofHeroes.com that lists every recipient of the Silver Star in the wars on terror. Also, one of the photos used in the eRumor, which reportedly depicts Tank lying next to a kennel in a dog shelter, was taken from an animal group’s website . The photo shows a black lab that suffered a broken spine and had to be put to sleep. The facts of the eRumor also do not make sense. Organizations like Dogs on Deployment and Guardian Angels for Soldier’s Pet help deployed veterans find temporary or forever homes for their dogs and pets. It seems unlikely that a solider would make an outside arrangement with an animal shelter because those organizations specialize in placing pets in loving, caring homes.

"Environmental fears over Navy sonar-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/navysonar/"," There are several emails circulating about this, but the most popular one says it’s endorsed by musician James Taylor, actor Pierce Bronson, and adventurer/oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau.  It says that they are disturbed that the Navy is going to start bombarding the oceans of the world with noise in the form of “Low-Frequency Active” sound waves (LFA).  The sonar, which is due to be used in 80 per cent of the world’s oceans, is to detect and track enemy submarines.  The signers of the email are especially concerned about the sonar’s effect on whales and dolphins, which depend on their sensitive hearing for survival.  The email says that if any ocean life swims too close to the devices that originate the sound waves, the powerful emissions could destroy hearing, cause lungs or ears to hemorrhage, and cause death.  They cite an episode in The Bahamas in which whales from four different species mysteriously beached themselves.  It was discovered that most of the whales had hemorrhaging around the inner ear and a U.S. Navy report concluded that the beachings were probably the result of use of mid-frequency sonar.  The email says that funding for the program is being decided right now in congress and gives you a website to use to register your opinion. "," This is a real issue and the eRumor about James Taylor, Pierce Bronsan, and Jean-Michel Cousteau joining together about the controversy is true.  They teamed with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Ocean Futures Society (OFS) in April, 2001 when hearings were held by the National Marine Fisheries Service on whether the Navy would be allowed to deploy the system. Critics of the sonar say a significant event occurred in the Spring of 1991 that underscored their concerns.  The Navy was using a sonar system in exercises in the Bahamas and, according to the  New York Times (April 15, 2001), 16 beaked whales and a dolphin became disoriented and stranded on beaches and in shallow water around the northern islands.  Most of the whales were guided back to the open sea, but six of them and the dolphin died.  Necropsies showed the mammals had hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears.  A year later, a task force that included the Navy concluded that it was “…highly likely…” that the strandings were linked to the sonar.  The Navy has responded by saying that they were using a medium-frequency sonar in the Bahamas and the one they want permits to use is a low-frequency sonar and that they propose standards for its use that would protect and monitor marine life. Still, according to the U.S. Navy, whales being killed or injured by sonar is largely unproven. Lt. William Marks, the Navy’s spokesman on sonar and marine mammal policy, told TruthOrFiction.com that the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration lists more than 35,000 incidents of stranded mammals over a period of ten years. Only one of those has been conclusively linked to the use of Navy sonar–and that’s the one in the Bahamas in 1991.  Lt.

"Jane Fonda’s supported the enemy in Vietnam got American POW’skilled-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hanoijane/"," In protest of Jane Fonda being considered as one of the top 100 women of the century, this email reminds Americans of her controversial visit to North Vietnam during the war. It quotes a POW named Jerry Driscoll who was taken from his prison cell, cleaned and dressed for a visit with Fonda, then ordered to give Fonda a positive account of his treatment. He spit at Fonda and was beaten and dragged away.  Then a group of POWs which included a Col. Larry Carrigan were brought out to visit with Fonda.  According to the story, “…she walked the line, shaking each man’s hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: “Aren’t you sorry you bombed babies?” & “Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?”  Many of the POW’s were listed as missing in action so to identify themselves to American authorities, they each wrote their Social Security numbers on small pieces of paper and slipped them to Fonda as she greeted them.  To their horror, however, after Fonda finished meeting them, she turned to the North Vietnamese commanding officer and handed him the POW’s pieces of paper.  In the beatings that followed, three American POW’s died and Col. Carrigan nearly died.  The email then ends with a statement about events in North Vietnam from an unnamed American POW. "," February 16, 2013 Update: This rumor has once again gone viral with the news of a film where actress Jane Fonda will be portraying the role of Nancy Reagan.    The film is called The Butler and is about a man who served as a butler under 8 U.S. Presidents in the White House.  At this time it is still in the post production stage and no release date has been issued. October 7, 2010 Update: A version of this eRumor have begun circulating in 2010 saying that President Obama is honoring Jane Fonda.  This version has been circulating since 2009 and is pretty much a carbon copy of the original Barbara Walters eRumor. This story hearkens to a real visit to North Vietnam by Jane Fonda in July of 1972, but     the stories about betraying POWs is not true. The Fonda trip became unforgettable because it infuriated Americans, especially Americans in uniform, many of whom still regard her as a traitor.  She praised the North Vietnamese, posed for a photo at a Communist anti-aircraft gun emplacement, made several radio broadcasts for the Communist North Vietnamese in which she called American military leaders “war criminals,” then when some of the POWs returned home and described mistreatment by the North Vietnamese, she said Americans should “…not hail the POWs as heroes, because they are hypocrites and liars.” There is no dispute that her visit took place and that her words and actions were in support of the enemy.  This particular email includes three stories, two of which have been denied by the POWs who are named, and one of which has been confirmed as true by the source, although he was not named in the email. First, the “100 Women of the Century” was a project of the Ladies Home Journal and a TV special hosted by Barbara Walters that aired April 30, 1999.  Jane Fonda was one of the 100. How the email story about the POWs got started is not known, but it has been widely circulated. TruthOrFiction.com located Jerry Driscoll who said that the accounts about him in the email are “…the product of a very vivid imagination” and he requests that people please stop passing it on to others. TruthOrFiction.com also contacted Mike McGrath, of Nam-POWs, who says the Larry Carrigan events never happened either.  He says Carrigan calls the story a “hoax” and does not want to be associated with it.  McGrath also says that some versions of the email include an account from a Dave Hoffman and that his story is true.  Hoffman says he was tortured (hung by a broken arm) until he agreed to go before Jane Fonda.  He was among a small group who witnessed one of her radio broadcasts for Hanoi.  The part of the email that begins with “To Whom it may concern” is true.  It’s a quote from an article titled SHAME ON JANE originally published on the Advocacy And Intelligence Index website on April 28, 1999 and written by Michael Benge who was a civilian captured by the North Vietnamese in 1968.  In his statement, he also makes reference to a missionary nurse who died in captivity.  For your interest, that was Betty Olsen, a Christian Missionary Alliance nurse from New York. In 1988 in an interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, Jane Fonda talked about her Vietnam visit and issued what some feel was an apology but which her critics say was not enough. Fonda said, “I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of the things that I said or did.  I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I’m…very sorry that I hurt them.  And I want to apologize to them and their families.” In 2005, Fonda published her autobiography in which she described in     detail her decision to go to North Vietnam. She said it was primarily motivated by her desire to document the U.S.     bombing of important dikes that, if destroyed, could kill tens of     thousands of people and devastate the lives of millions.  The U.S. had denied the bombings.     In the book, Fonda is unapologetic about the trip or her participation     in broadcasts on radio Hanoi but regrets the pictures taken of her at     the gun emplacement.  She said it made it appear as though she was celebrating armaments     aimed at American planes, which was not how she felt and was not the     context in which the pictures were taken.  She reminds readers that the U.S. investigated her trip and found no     reason to bring any charges against her.  She also describes her longstanding support of, and interaction with, U.S.     military personnel and says her only beef was with the U.S.     government, not the troops.

"Department of Defense Procedures to Shut Up Civilians-Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dod-interment-resettlement-ops/"," This is a forwarded link to a video posted on YouTube that warns a manual for Interment and Resettlement Operations by U.S. Department of Defense.  The narrator on the video alleges that the operations will be used on citizens in the U.S. "," The manual appears to be real and was dated 12 February 2010 but it is what the narrator of the video calls “leaked.” We have no indication that it is a current policy of the Department of the Defense (DOD) or that the government has policies in place to incarcerate U.S. Civilians. This manual was found by reference number “FM 3-39.40” on an official military publications site .  That site requires a DOD approval certificate log, which we do not have at the time of this writing to authenticate the “leaked” copy with the official manual. Another unofficial copy of the manual was found posted on the Internet where anyone can download and read. Click to download manual. It is possible that the narrator is spinning a conspiracy theory that the government is out to get us from his interpretation of this manual.  The video’s allegations could be a misinterpretation of what is written in the manual because branches of the DOD are part of the logistical team that are used throughout the world when natural disasters strike. The preface of the manual states that the military police operations could be called in to assist in disaster relief efforts both nationally and abroad: Military police conduct I/R operations during offensive, defensive, stability, or civil support operations. I/R operations include military police support to U.S. military prisoner and detainee operations within operational environments (OEs), ranging from major combat operations to humanitarian-assistance missions in support of a host nation (HN) or civil agency. On page 14  the manual there is a flow chart that shows that “Displaced Civilians” (DC) come under resettlement operations and not classified as “Detainees.”   Yet, there is a classification for “Civilian Internees” (CI) who fall under the Detainee category.  In this context. an enemy combatant affiliated with a terrorist cell would come under the category of CI where the victim of a flood or earthquake whose home or city was destroyed could come under DC.  Under the heading of DC are included refugees, migrants, expellees, internally displaced persons, evacuees and stateless persons. Flow chart found on page 14 of the manual Civilian Internee (CI) is defined in the manual on page 17: 1-10. A CI is a civilian who is interned during armed conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power. (JP 3-63) CIs, unless they have committed acts for which they are considered unlawful combatants, generally qualify for protected status according to the GC, which also establishes procedures that must be observed when depriving such civilians of their liberty. CIs are to be accommodated separately from EPWs and persons deprived of liberty for any other reason. Displaced Civilian is not defined but the manual does describe how they should be treated on page 33: DISPLACED CIVILIAN HANDLING 2-10. Military police units may be required to support the collection and control of DCs. In offensive, defensive, and stability operations many of the fundamentals are similar to that of handling detainees, but the focus is typically different. The handling of DCs is also a mission that may be performed in support of disaster relief or other emergencies within the United States or U.S. territories during civil support operations. As such, local, state and federal agencies are primarily responsible for handling DCs with the U.S. military in a support role. When a state of emergency is declared, the state’s national guard may be called to assist with DCs under the control of the state governor or they may be federalized and conduct operations as federal U.S. military forces. (See Titles 10 and 32, U.S. Code [USC].) It is important to keep in mind that such a manual was designed to handle an unlimited number of possible scenarios where agencies under the  U.S. Department of Defense play a role. The video also alleges that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) would be involved.   In the event of a natural disaster in the U.S. these agencies would be involved.  FEMA provides the Incident Command System training for all US agencies involved in response missions.  FEMA comes under the blanket of the DHS. updated 03/12/13 ","Military"

"," It’s true that U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s comrades have accused him of deserting his post rather than being captured by the Taliban. In June 2012, Rolling Stone reported that Bergdahl walked away from his company’s outpost in Patika Province, Afghanistan, with only water, a camera, a knife and his journal. He was not heard from again until the Taliban posted a video of him in captivity. The article includes this excerpt from an email that Bergdahl reportedly sent to his parents, Robert and Jan Bergdahl, shortly before his capture that describes his frustration with the war effort. “The future is too good to waste on lies,” Bergdahl reportedly wrote. “And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong. I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be american. The horror of the self-righteous arrogance that they thrive in. It is all revolting.” Following news that the Obama administration had negotiated the release of five prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay prison in exchange for Bergdahl’s release, a sergeant who served with Bergdahl expressed frustration, CNN reported on June 2, 2014. “I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,” former Sgt. Matt Vierkant told CNN. “Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.” Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters on June 1, 2014, that U.S. officials’ first priority was Bergdahl’s safe release.

According to a UNICEF report at the end of 2003, more than 3 1/2 million children had been immunized. School Attendance is up 80%- Truth! Again, according to an April, 2004 report from UNICEF, school attendance in Iraq increased by 60 percent shortly after the war to more than 95 percent during the recent national exam week. More than 1,500 schools renovated- Truth! UNICEF says that as of April, 2004, more than 2,500 schools have been renovated with the goal of 4,000 being completed by the end of the year, but 10,000 more need repair. The Port of Uhm Qasar [sic] renovated so grain can be offloaded faster- Truth! In a November, 2003 interview on National Public Radio, Andrew Natsios of the U.S. Agency for International Development said that the port at Umm Qasar, Iraq’s largest, is modern and functioning for the first time in 20 years. Iraqi oil reached 2 billion barrels exported in August of 2003- Fiction! Iraq sits on the second largest proven crude oil reserves in the world and the flow of oil resumed in August, 2003 amid equipment that needed repair and suffered from looting and attacks from saboteurs. The initial flow in August, 2003, was 500,000 barrels per day, according to the BBC. Iraqi oil is subject to the ups and downs of the crude oil market but in April, 2003, more than 2 million barrels a day were being produced, but that has not accumulated to 2 billion. Clean drinking water for the first time for than 4.5 million Iraqis- Fiction! According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, safe drinking water was not widespread in Iraq before the U.S. led coalition invaded Iraq but that was partly because of water treatment systems that were in disrepair or had been looted. In other words, clean water is not new to Iraq. We couldn’t find any figures that indicated how many would be receiving clean water for the first time. In December, 2003, USAID was on track to provide clean water to more than 14 million Iraqis. Iraq has twice the electrical power than before the war- Fiction! USAID says power was restored in October, 2003 to slightly more than pre-war levels, or more than 4500 MW as opposed to about 4400 MW prior to the war. The goal was to reach 6000 MW by the summer of 2004. All of the hospitals operating- Truth! Because of disrepair and looting, it took a lot of work to get hospitals back up to speed but according to James Haverman, the Coalition Provisional Authority Senior Advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, all 240 hospitals in Iraq as well as 2400 primary health care clinics were operating as of December, 2003. Elections taking place in all major cities- Fiction! This has been a source of contention in Iraq. In June of 2003 U.S. authorities called halts to local elections across Iraq and chose to put hand-chosen mayors or administrators into office. There have been various local elections since that time and debate over whether Iraq is ready for national elections. According to the Army New Service, there were three truly democratic elections by the end of 2003 in the cities of Tallafar, Zumar and Al-Eyaldia in northern Iraq. Sewer and water lines installed in every major city- Unproven! We’re not sure about all the major cities, but according to USAID, the water and sewage in Iraq has been suffering from years of neglect, electricity shortages, and post-war looting.

More than 60,000 police in the streets, more than 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police securing the country, and 80,000 Iraqi soldiers patrolling the streets with the U.S. soldiers- Mostly Fiction!

The first class of more than 400 police offers graduated in January, 2004. The Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) is composed of Iraqis who remain citizens, as opposed to serving full time in the military, and are integrated into the coalition military units. The internal defense of the country is in their hands and they are led by the coalition. According to There were about 25,000 hired and trained by February, 2004.

Girls are allowed to attend school- Truth! But Misleading! A quick read of Sgt. Reynolds’ report would leave the impression that Iraqi girls are able to attend school for the first time because of the invasion. According to Human Rights Watch, Iraqi girls and women have enjoyed comparatively more rights than in some of the other countries of the Middle East. The Iraqi Constitution of 1970 included women’s rights for voting, attending school, owning property, and running for office. Still, the status of women in Iraq has not always been the best because of other cultural and economic factors such as the aftermath of the 1991 war and economic sanctions. School attendance for girls has not been prohibited although more boys than girls have been enrolled, especially in rural areas. Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs- Truth! Not only are U.S. soldiers demonstrating field sanitation and hand washing, but UNICEF is conducting an active health education program to improve personal hygiene and promote more hand washing. Textbooks that don’t mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years- Truth! According to published reports, a team of U.S. appointed Iraqi educators combed through more than 500 Iraqi textbooks and removed every mention of Saddam Hussein and the Baath party including pictures.

"," What most people want to know is whether Powell made this statement. He did, although some other facts in the eRumor are incorrect. First, Powell’s statement was not made in England. It was during a presentation to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland during January, 2003. Second, the questioner was not the current Archbishop of Canterbury, but the former Archbishop, George Carey. Third,  Carey was not asking about “empire building.”  He asked Powell whether the U.S. was relying too much on “hard power” such as military action as opposed to “soft power” such as appealing to the common values of the major religions and building trust based on those values. Powell responded by affirming the “soft power” of values but that it was the “hard power” of the military that, for example, helped free Europe and so the “soft power” of peace and reconstruction could take place. Powell then said, “ We have gone forth from our shores repeatedly over the last hundred years and we’ve done this as recently as the last year in Afghanistan and put wonderful young men and women at risk, many of whom have lost their lives, and we have asked for nothing except enough ground to bury them in, and otherwise we have returned home to seek our own, you know, to seek our own lives in peace, to live our own lives in peace.

"Accusations against John Kerry from Former Navy Swift Boat crewmen from the Vietnam War-Truth!, Fiction! & Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kerry-swiftboats/"," There is a series of forwarded emails about Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry and the accusations of an organization of swift boat crews from the Vietnam era. "," John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign included focus on his service in the U.S. Navy in Vietnam where he served as an officer in command of a Navy swift boat. Kerry emphasized his experience as a military veteran, his four months of service in the Vietnam war, his 3 purple hearts, The Bronze Star, and the Silver Star. A group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans For Truth set up a website critical of Kerry and making several accusations against him. The “Swifties,” as they became known, produced an anti-Kerry television ad, promoted the anti-Kerry statements of several veterans who also served on swift boat crews in Vietnam, and became the springboard for a book about Kerry titled “Unfit For Command” and co-authored by John E. O ‘ Neill and Jerome Corsi. O’Neill is a key member of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and Vietnam veteran who debated Kerry on the Dick Cavett show back in 1971. O’Neill replaced Kerry as the commanding officer of the same swift boat in Vietnam. He criticizes Kerry for his 1970’s statements charging that U.S. military troops committed widespread war crimes. The Kerry campaign dismissed the accusations of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth saying they were a politically motivated group financed by people who were close to George Bush and were conducting an election-year smear campaign. They called upon President Bush to condemn the television ad and to call for it to be removed. The Bush campaign denied any connection with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Here are some of the specific issues being raised in forwarded emails regarding the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and the Kerry and Bush campaigns. Questions about Kerry’s rescue of Army Green Beret Jim Rassmann during a fight on a river in South Vietnam Kerry was awarded a Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his actions during this event. Rassmann held a news conference in Phoenix in July, 2004, to say he owed his life to Kerry and that he was supporting his reelection. Rassmann says he was in a river boat 30 years ago in the Hap river in Vietnam when it hit a mine. Kerry’s swift boat was nearby and under attack, he says. Kerry was wounded in his arm, according to Rassmann, but ordered his boat to turn back and rescue the soldier. He describes Kerry as having leaned over the bow during heavy fire to pull him out of the water. Rassmann later recommended Kerry for the Bronze Star. The Swift Boat Veterans, however, claim that Kerry lied in his account of what happened on the river. One of the veterans who says he was there, Van Odell, says his is one of seven eyewitness accounts and that Kerry was not under enemy fire when he pulled Rassmann out of the river. He told “Fox New Sunday” on August 22, 2004 that “There was no enemy fire from either bank.” In late August, 2004, Wayne Langhofer, who says he was manning a machine gun on a boat behind Kerry’s, told the Washington Post that he saw enemy fire from both sides of the river as Kerry rescued Rassmann, which was supportive of Kerry’s account. Larry Thurlow commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry’s and is among the Swift Boat Veterans critical of Kerry. He is quoted as having said that Kerry’s boat was not under fire as Kerry claimed. The Washington Post reported on August 18, however, that Thurlow’s military records contradict his statement. Thurlow won the Bronze Star that day and his citation says he provided assistance to a damaged swift boat “despite enemy bullets flying about him” and that all other units in the flotilla also came under fire. In response, Thurlow told The Post that he maintains his position that they were not under fire and that if his citation says they were, he wondered if Kerry was the source of some of the language. Questions about another battle incident in which Kerry won the Silver Star. The Silver Star citation describes Kerry as in command of three boats on the Dong Cung River in Vietnam. According to the citation, Kerry encountered enemy fire and ordered all his boats to return fire. He is then described as having landed his boat directly in front of the enemy forces, pursued them, captured enemy weapons, then moving up river for more confrontation with the enemy. The citation reads, “The extraordinary daring and personal courage of Lt. Kerry in attacking a numerically superior force in the face of intense fire were responsible for the highly successful mission.” The Swift Boat veterans say the citation was presented very quickly, a couple of days after the events in battle and with no review, otherwise the Silver Star would have never been granted. In his book about Kerry titled “Unfit For Command,” co-author John O’Neill wrote of an account by an Army Veteran named Doug Reese that said that when the enemy fire started, it was the boat he was on, not Kerry’s, that first reached the beach. He says that it was the troops on his boat that went on the land, killed enemy forces, and captured weapons, but none of them received Silver Stars. He goes on to say that Kerry’s boat was later hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and pursued a “young Viet Cong in a loincloth” who was eventually shot in the back on land. O’Neill says Admiral Roy Hoffmann, who had commended Kerry’s actions at the time, thought Kerry had bravely beached his boat and “single-handedly” killed a Viet Cong soldier. He is described as having been shocked to learn that Kerry had killed a single, wounded teenager. After the Swift Boat Veterans released their criticisms of Kerry, two of Kerry’s former Navy colleagues went public in support of him. William Rood is an editor with the Chicago Tribune and a former commander of one of the swift boats with Kerry on that day on the Dong Cung river. He said he was breaking a 35-year silence so he could defend all the veterans on that mission whose reputations were being smeared. He said Kerry “devised an aggressive attack strategy” that was praised by superiors and that Kerry’s accounts of what happened are accurate. Was John Kerry in Cambodia during Christmas of 1968? One of the things John Kerry has talked and written about for a long time was what he described as his “illegally” being ordered to enter Cambodia. In a letter to the editor of the Boston Herald in October, 1979, Kerry wrote, “I remember spending Christmas Eve of 1968 five miles across the Cambodian border being shot at by our South Vietnamese allies who were drunk and celebrating Christmas. The absurdity of almost being killed by our own allies in a country in which President Nixon claimed there were no American troops was very real.” He also made reference to the Cambodia-Christmas story during remarks on the floor of the Senate in 1986. He said the memory was “seared” in him. Kerry said his “deep mistrust” of U.S. government statements began when he was in Cambodia at Christmas listened to President Richard Nixon claim that no American troops were there. The Swifties begin by saying that Richard Nixon was not president during Christmas of 1968 so there could not have been the broadcast that Kerry says he heard. Swift Boat veteran John O’Neill charges that Kerry lied about Cambodia and that he was never closer than 50-miles to the Cambodian border. O’Neill says that all the living commanders in Kerry’s chain of command deny that Kerry could have gone there and that if he had, he would have been seriously disciplined or court-martialed. O’Neill adds that three of the five crewmen on Kerry’s swift boat also deny that they ever went into Cambodia. The Cambodia story is not in the biography about Kerry titled “Tour of Duty.” There are reports that an article is being prepared by the author of the book that says Kerry was in Cambodia during Christmas, not January. Kerry used an old picture of himself and other swift boat crewmen in Vietnam in one of his campaign ads, but only one or two of the 19 officers in the picture really support him This is mostly true. There are conflicting reports but either one or two of those pictured supports Kerry; eleven have signed letters saying they do not support him, four say they are neutral, and 2 have died. Eleven of them, George Bates, Thomas Heritage, Terrance Costello, Robert “Rocky” Hildreath, Robert Elder, William Houle, George Elliott, William Schumadine, Al French, Larry Thurlow, and Jim Galvin, asked Kerry to stop using their pictures in his campaign materials. Questions about Dr. Louis Letson, who says he treated Kerry for one of his wounds and that Kerry lied in order to get a Purple Heart. One of the Swifties is a physician named Dr. Louis Letson. He says he treated Kerry for one of the injuries for which Kerry won a Purple Heart and that Kerry is lying about it. Kerry’s supporters responded that Letson’s name does not appear in any of the records as having treated Kerry. The “person administering treatment” on Kerry’s medical form was a medic who has since died. Letson countered that it was not unusual for a minor wound to be handled by a medic who would then also sign the forms even though a doctor or someone else may have initially provided treatment.","Military"

"," This eRumor started circulating shortly after Senator Clinton made a Thanksgiving visit to the soldiers in Iraq in 2003. There was a lot of speculation about what the picture really meant. Was the soldier really indicating that he didn’t like shaking hands with Hillary? Was the picture doctored to make it look that way? Was he sending some other kind of message with his crossed fingers? The answer is that he did intentionally cross his fingers during the handshake and it did mean that he was not thrilled to shake Senator Clinton’s hand. After his discharge from the Army, the soldier posted a personal profile on Yahoo Personals as part of looking for introductions to single females. In his profile, he includes the picture with Hillary and explains “The picture of me and Hillary Clinton was taken when she came to visit Iraq.

The airplane in the pictures is a Mig 25, nicknamed The Foxbat.  Reith said that it is one of two dozen that were sent to Iraq in 1979 by the Soviets.  The Mig 25 did not perform well, however, in either the Iran-Iraq war or the gulf war in 1991.  It was no match for British and U.S. in the Gulf War planes so Sadaam Hussein did not use the planes very much after two of them were quickly shot down.  Reith said that by the time U.S. and coalition troops invaded Iraq in 2003 the jets were not in action.  They had been hidden by burying them in desert sand. Contrary to the claims of the forwarded email, these were not “buried treasure” equipped with “sophisticated electronic warfare devices.”  Reith reported that they were remnants of the cold war and more than 30-years old.  In other words, nothing that had not been seen by the U.S. before.

There has been debate about troop strength in Iraq and the status of all the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Selective Service, however, says that despite the Internet stories, the agency is not getting ready to conduct a draft. It says it is ready to do so should the President and Congress decide, but “that responsibility has been ongoing since 1980 and is nothing new.” The Selective Service further says that “…both the President and the Secretary of Defense have stated on more than one occasion that there is no need for a draft for the War on Terrorism or any likely contingency, such as Iraq.

An article from May 5, 2005 in the Hood County News in Granbury, Texas, says that Chad is home and has recovered enough that he’s thinking about going to college. According to the article, the sniper’s bullet hit Snowden just above and behind his left eyebrow and exited the right side. From the time his mother first heard of his injuries it was only five days from the time that he was regarded as extremely critical until he could be moved from Iraq to Germany for treatment.  Then once in Germany, he was kept for only a day until being moved to Water Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. While there, he and his mother met President and Mrs. Bush as they visited wounded soldiers and their families at Walter Reed. Chad’s injuries were such that only a small part of his brain was damaged. In a short time, he was ready to be moved from Walter Reed to a military rehabilitation trauma brain injury hospital but, according to the article, that was delayed because of an  overload of paperwork required.

It is true that her current husband has filed for divorce, but it’s not a second divorce.  The couple had a total of four children, two sons and two daughters.  According to records filed in Solano County District Court in California, Sheehan’s husband Patrick filed for divorce on August 12 saying that the couple had been separated since June.

Meanwhile, the liver intended for the Crystal was in San Diego, California.  An airplane that was to fly the liver to Houston developed pressurization problems.  When that news reached Elisabeth City, the Coca-Cola CEO asked his pilots whether they could also make a trip to San Diego to pick up the liver, but was told that would take longer than the amount of time that was left go get the transplant done.  The CEO then got on the phone to, among other people, the governor of California.  The result was that Navy Lt. Tony Less of the Navy’s famous Blue Angels precision flying team took off for Houston in “Blue Angel #8,” a brand new F-18 fighter jet, with the liver container safely strapped in the rear seat.

"George W. Bush a deserter from the military?-Disputed!","2015-03-17 20:42:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bush-desert/"," The eRumor asks the question of why George W. Bush was not prosecuted for desertion from the military during his time of service.  It suggests that perhaps his father, George H. Bush, played a role in preventing it. "," Mr. Bush’s critics are describing him as a deserter, an officer who went AWOL. His defenders say that it’s exaggeration to equate him with active duty personnel who desert their post, say good bye to the military, and go into hiding. Getting a clear picture is difficult, although there are some records of his military service that have been released. George W. Bush’s military service has been a controversy in each of his elections. The current controversy all got started with an investigation by the Boston Globe newspaper. The Globe concluded that Mr. Bush was an excellent National Guard pilot who served portions of his six-year commitment by putting in more active-duty time than required, but there is a year toward the end of his time of service during which there are no records of his having shown up for required meetings and drills. The Globe also explored the question of whether he got into the National Guard through strings pulled for him as the son of a U.S. Congressman. The article concludes that he did benefit from favored treatment on more than one occasion. In May of 1968 Mr. Bush enlisted and was chosen for training as an Air Force pilot. Critics have noted that he got into pilot training despite poor initial testing, suggesting that someone on the inside helped move him to the top of the list. The Globe interviewed National Guard officials who said it was because few National Guard enlistees were willing to commit to the required 18 months of flight training and that put them higher on the list. In November of 1969, the future president completed flight training and was assigned to become an F-102 fighter pilot assigned to Ellington Air Force Base. Until his fifth year of National Guard duty, there is no question about his service. The Globe says those who served with Mr. Bush regarded him as a top pilot and that he spent more time on active duty than was minimally required for reservists. In the first four years of of his six-year commitment, he spent the equivalent of 21 months on duty. In May of 1972, George W. Bush moved to Alabama to help in a U.S. Senate campaign and requested permission to serve in a unit in that state. His superiors, however, later said they did not approve of that unit because the unit didn’t do much. There were virtually no drills or exercises. The unit’s commander told the Boston Globe that it had no airplanes and essentially met one weeknight per month. The Globe says that months apparently went by without resolution to Mr. Bush’s status and, therefore, no guard duty. Technically, without new orders, he was still a part of his unit in Texas, but he was living in Alabama. Mr. Bush was eventually assigned to a unit in Montgomery. One of the superior officers there told the Globe he could not remember George Bush serving there.  But in 2004, he told reporters that he never intended for that statement to mean that Mr. Bush hadn’t served. He was simply saying he didn’t recall his being there.. During that time, Bush failed to take his annual pilot’s physical examination and was removed from flight status. A Bush spokesman told the Globe that Mr. Bush does recall doing some duty in Alabama. On another occasion, a representative for the president said that Bush made up for any time that was lost by participating in other drills. But his service records show about a year in which there is no report of duty. From May to July of 1973, the records show that Mr. Bush did log 36 days of active duty.  He was granted an honorable discharge in October of 1973. The records for July, August and September have not been found and officials say they were inadvertently destroyed. The New York Times looked into the allegations in 2002 and concluded that the time Mr. Bush missed had been made up satisfactorily and that his records showed his having performed all the required service. George Magazine looked into the story as well and concluded that there were two documents in George Bush’s records that indicated that he accumulated 56 points toward his required minimum of 50 points necessary to be regarded as a guardsman at the time that is in question. In 2004, the issue flared again during the presidential primary season. The White House released pay stubs from the Alabama years, saying it was proof that he served. Critics said that was only proof that he got paid, which was never in dispute, not that he actually served. In July, 2004, the Pentagon released newly discovered records from the Alabama year, but they, like the previous records, did not include July through September and did not shed any light on those months. In September, 2004, CBS reported on some newly discovered memos including one from Col. Walter “Buck” Staudt that said openly that Bush sought special favors in the National Guard and did not fulfill his service. There were immediate questions, however, about the authenticity of the memos. Typography experts said the documents appeared to have been created on equipment that was not available during the early 1970’s when they were supposedly written. The Dallas Morning News then revealed that Col. Staudt had been honorably discharged from the military a year-and-a-half before the date on the memo. CBS stood by its story for two weeks, then announced on 9/20/04 that it had been misled about the documents and that it could no longer vouch for their authenticity.

"," It’s true that a former Marine was held for psychiatric evaluation after authorities were tipped-off about cryptic anti-government Facebook posts he made. The case doesn’t, however, prove that a larger crackdown on people who post anti-government comments on social media sites is underway. Police from Chesterfield, Virginia, detained former Marine Brandon Raub for a mental health evaluation on August 16, 2012. Police and FBI agents had been dispatched to Raub’s home to investigate a complaint that his Facebook posts had grown increasingly dark. Chesterfield Police said county mental health crisis intervention workers determined that Raub should be held under a temporary detention order and taken to a hospital for further evaluation based on his interactions with police. Raub was held in psychiatric care until a county judge ordered his release on August 23, 2012. In his ruling, the judge said Raub had suffered “a deprivation of liberty,” an NBC News affiliate reports . No criminal charges were filed in the case. In May 2013, attorneys for the Rutherford Institute, an organization that says it defends civil liberties, filed a civil lawsuit on Raub’s behalf. The lawsuit sought damages for alleged violations of Raub’s First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In March 2014, a federal judge dismissed the case and said mental health workers had acted reasonably in recommending Raub’s detention, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports . Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute appealed the decision in August 2014. The appeal says a former Marine who served with Raub in Iraq had tipped-off authorities about Raub’s Facebook posts. Some of the posts called for the arrests of President George W. Bush and President H.W. Bush and claimed that the U.S. government had orchestrated 9/11. Raub also talked about how revolution could lead to the former presidents’ demise. Another passage that drew attention stated, “Sharpen up my axe; I’m here to severe heads.” Raub later argued that the passage was intended to be “metaphorical” and said it was a song lyric. Authorities determined that Raub’s messages didn’t include specific threats of violence and didn’t rise to a criminal level. The eRumor’s claims about a larger ant-government crackdown may be based on “Operation Vigilant Eagle.” The FBI launched the program in April 2009 to target white supremacists and “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reports . FBI memos stated that the Vigilant Eagle program was designed to “share information regarding Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans whose involvement in white supremacy and/or militia sovereign citizen extremist groups poses a domestic terrorism threat.” However, the FBI didn’t detain Raub as part of Vigilant Eagle.

"," Encouraging veterans to vote   is an admirable cause, but this eRumor uses false information to make   the case. U.S.   policy regarding the U.N.’s International Criminal Court (ICC) hasn’t   changed much since President Bill Clinton left office in 2000. ICC was   established in the Hague as a permanent, independent court under the   Rome Statute in July 2002. Its stated purpose was to bring individuals   who commit war crimes, or crimes against humanity, to justice, the   Congressional Research Service reports . Clinton signed the Rome   Statute in 2000, but Congress never ratified U.S. membership. Clinton   said he wouldn’t recommend ratification to the Senate due to concern   that the ICC could assert jurisdiction over U.S. officials and members   of U.S. Armed Forces — even if the U.S. was not a party to the Rome   Statute. In 2002, President George W. Bush said the U.S. wouldn’t be a   party to the Rome Statute. By the end of Bush’s second term, however,   the U.S. “began to treat the ICC as a potentially effective tool for   international criminal justice.” The Obama administration officials   supported several ICC prosecutions and, in 2010, “reiterated the United   States’ intention to provide diplomatic and informational support to ICC   prosecutions on a case-by-case basis.” The American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002 forbids the U.S. government from providing material assistance to the   ICC, the Congressional Research Service reports . Still, there’s no   proof to the eRumor’s claim that Obama plans to ask the Senate to ratify   the Rome Statute. Even conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation   have said as   much. “The most   significant policy change is that the U.S. now attends the meetings of   the Assembly of States Parties of the International Court,” Brian   Schaefer, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation said. “No wonder   conservatives are not paying the ICC much mind. U.S. policy is already   largely where they want it to be, and the Obama administration,   thankfully, appears uninterested in changing it.” The eRumor’s claim   that more than 1,000 American soldiers had died in Afghanistan in the   previous 27 months was also untrue. There were 175 fatalities in   Afghanistan from 2013 to mid 2014, the non-profit group icasualties.org reports . Posted 10/06/14 ","Military"

"," This is quite an assault on Target stores and is becoming an example of how a rumor can mushroom and pick up momentum along the way. It started with a man named Dick Forrey. He is listed as being with Howard County Vietnam Veterans in the state of Indiana.  He says that he did have the experiences both with the local Target store and the Target corporate offices as is described in one of the stories and did originate an email expressing his displeasure.  It is not true, however, that Target categorically refuses to fund Veteran’s projects and even Forrey is upset with how large this eRumor has spread. The Target company is sending a written response to people who inquire about the Forrey story that says that Target gives $2 million per week in the communities where stores are located. The Target letter says a veteran (referring to Forrey) approached a local store in March, 2002 for a $100 donation to a “moving wall” project. The response says that any donations by local stores are not in cash but in gift certificates or volunteer time. Cash is given by the corporate office and in response to official requests for grants. The letter says that the veteran who asked for the donation should have been given grant information from the store, but was not. The Target response also says that the company makes donations in three general areas: education, arts and family violence prevention. The company is happy to donate to any veterans causes that would fit within those guidelines. So while it’s true that donations would not be given to a veterans project per se, they would be given if the veterans project is within the guidelines. Regarding Target’s ownership, the company is on record as a U.S. firm based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and always has been. There is no foreign ownership in its past or present that we’ve been able to find or been presented with evidence about.   Target is a public corporation and a list of their executive officers and board of directors can be found on the investor section of the company’s website . Regarding benefits for reservists on active duty, this has been a big issue since so many reservists were called in for service in the Middle East and the National Committee for Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve has been a watchdog of companies and how they treat reservists. They list target in the “Outstanding Employer” category which means it has “gone above and beyond the requirements of the law in support of their National Guard and Reserve employees.” So how did such a completely false email come into being? It’s easy to suspect a conspiracy or organized effort against Target but from our viewpoint this appears to have gotten started with the Dick Forrey letter and as others read it and got angry over it, they added other false charges in order to stack the deck. In 2011 this eRumor once again gained momentum after Target began operations in Canada.   Someone added “2013” to the subject of the eRumor and in the summer of that year this oldie rose from the ashes and once again went viral on the World Wide Web.

David Motari, based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment.  On June 12, 2008, the Marines announced that Motari was “being processed for separation” from the corps and had received non-judicial punishment, but did not say what the punishment was. A second Marine, San Diego-based Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion, received non-judicial punishment as well.  He was the one who actually shot the video.

Since Palin’s election in 2006 the Air Guard has flown 521 missions, saving 200 lives and assisting with the rescue of 77 more people.   The foreign deployments of units and the operation of missile interceptors are not the responsibility of state governors.

"," We have not found any evidence to substantiate that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Leon Panetta overrode the President’s authority.   All statements indicate that the order was given on the Thursday prior to the mission. CIA Director Panetta’s Account In a May 3rd NBC news interview Panetta told reporter Brian Williams that the President signed the mission order on the previous Thursday, the 28th of April. Dialog from the NBC interview: BRIAN WILLIAMS:  When did the President’s order in this mission become real and go up and become a possibility? LEON PANETTA: Well, as you know as we’ve been- debating this issue for a long time. And we had a number of sessions at the White House going over all of the intelligence and all of the approaches as to how we would conduct these operations. But it wasn’t until Thursday morning that the national security advisor called me and said that the President had made a decision to proceed with this operation. And then later that day I received orders signed by the President of the United States to proceed to conduct this operation under Title 50, which means it was a covert operation. And we would be responsible from the President for seeing that this mission was accomplished. White House photo of President Obama and his staff watching the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden The President’s Account On May 8, 2011 the President appeared on the CBS Sixty Minutes program and told reporter Steve Kroft that he was in the situation room monitoring the mission.  Obama was aware of unfolding events around the compound and getting reports from special forces operations head Bill McRaven and Leon Panetta. Dialog from President Obama’s account of the mission on CBS 60 Minutes program: KROFT: I want to go to the Situation Room. What was the mood? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tense. KROFT: People talking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, but doing a lot of listening as well, ’cause we were able to monitor the situation in real time. Getting reports back from Bill McRaven, the head of our special forces operations, as well as Leon Panetta. And you know, there were big chunks of time in which all we were doin’ was just waiting. And it was the longest 40 minutes of my life with the possible exception of when Sasha got meningitis when she was three months old, and I was waiting for the doctor to tell me that she was all right. It was a very tense situation. KROFT: Were you nervous? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What could you see? PRESIDENT OBAMA: As I said, we were monitoring the situation. And we knew as events unfolded what was happening in and around the compound, but we could not get information clearly about what was happening inside the compound. KROFT: Right. And that went on for a long time? Could you hear gunfire? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had a sense of when gunfire and explosions took place. KROFT: Flashes? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. And we also knew when one of the helicopters went down in a way that wasn’t according to plan. And, as you might imagine that made us more tense. KROFT: So it got off to a bad start? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it did not go exactly according to planned, but this is exactly where all the work that had been done anticipating what might go wrong made a huge difference. KROFT: There was a backup plan? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a backup plan. KROFT: You had to blow up some walls? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had to blow up some walls. KROFT: When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? That bin Laden was in there? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed. And Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious. But at that point cautiously optimistic. KROFT: What was your reaction when you heard those words? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I was relieved and I wanted to make sure those guys got over the Pakistan border and landed safely. And I think deeply proud and deeply satisfied of my team. KROFT: When did you start to feel comfortable that bin Laden had been killed? PRESIDENT OBAMA: When they landed we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him. Photographs had been taken. Facial analysis indicated that in fact it was him. We hadn’t yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure. KROFT: Did you see the pictures? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What was your reaction when you saw them? PRESIDENT OBAMA: It was him.

Shortly after midnight April 8, 2009, while on route to deliver food aid to Uganda and Somalia the Maersk Alabama was attacked by the pirates about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia. The Alabama crew of 21 worked feverishly for more than three hours using fire hoses to fend off boarding attempts by the pirates. Eventually four pirates armed with AK-47 rifles managed to board the cargo ship.   Sometime during the fight the crew of the Alabama managed to disable their vessel and went into hiding near the steering compartment. Shortly after that the pirates boat was scuttled. About twelve hours later the crew emerged and managed to overtake and capture one of the pirates. The three other pirates had Capt. Phillips prisoner. In an attempt to secure the safety of his crew, Capt. Phillips offered himself as a hostage along with a 28 foot lifeboat from the Alabama.. In an attempt to secure the release of their captain the crew gave freedom to their pirate prisoner, but the pirates did not reciprocate. Captain Phillips remained in the hands of his captors.

"," There is no new policy by the Obama Administration forbidding U.S. Servicemen from appearing at faith-based fund raising events. We have found Department of Defense (DOD) ethics polices dating back as far as 1997 that prohibited DOD employees from officially endorsing or appearing to endorse membership drives or fundraising activities for non-federal entities.

Stube’s permission to speak was revoked by his commanding officer although this was not because of any new policy of the Obama administration, as the email implied. Sergeant Stube is with U.S. Army Special Forces and was seriously injured in 2006 while serving in Afghanistan.  An improvised explosive device (IED) set off by the Taliban detonated and sent a one-pound piece of shrapnel through his hip and his intestines.   He also lost part of his leg from the fire blast of the explosion but miraculously survived the ordeal.

"," Insect spy drones have been in development by the U.S. military and a number of universities for years, but the extent of the technology’s functionality is unknown. In 2008, the Air Force Research Laboratory set its sights on developing a tiny, armed drone that could be used by U.S. Special Forces to track and terminate “high-value targets,” Wired.com reports . The goal of the project, dubbed “Project Anubis,” was described in the Air Force’s 2008 budget as the development of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that “carries sensors, data links and munitions payload to engage time-sensitive fleeting targets in complex environments,” Wired reports. The fate of Project Anubis is unknown, but similar micro drones have been used and tested in the battlefield. U.S. forces in Afghanistan reportedly tested the Black Hornet drone , which is about the size of a hummingbird, in 2013. The Wasp drone, which weighs less than a pound and measures about 28 inches, has also been used by the military.

"Monopoly Used To Assist WWII POW Escapes-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/monopoly-game/"," An eRumor of how the British Secret Service, MI-5, developed a plan to send specially packaged versions of the popular board game “Monopoly”  by means of the International Red Cross to prisoners of war in Germany during World War II.   Agents contacted the British company who made the Monopoly game, Waddington PLC, and requested that design and manufacture silk maps to be hidden inside the games.  Specially marked games were not only equipped with the hidden silk map noting safe houses for food and shelter but also included secret devices like files and a compass disguised as game pieces to aid in an escape from the POW camp and behind enemy lines.  Also hidden within the play money was real German, Italian, and French currency. "," The Monopoly board game was created in 1933 by Charles Darrow who approached Parker Brothers regarding the marketing of the game.   At first, Parker Brothers turned him down but two years later purchased the game from Darrow and today it is one the most popular board games in the world. Silk maps of Germany, Italy, Norway and Sweden did exist during the Second World War, according to an article written by Debbie Hall for the Map Forum magazine in 1999.   Debbie Hall has a special interest in silk maps and was the Map Curator at the British Library where some of these silk maps are displayed. According to the article, The Waddington PLC company in England manufactured playing cards and game boards including the ones for Monopoly that were marketed in Great Britain.    Monopoly games were sent to British prisoners of war in Germany by the International Red Cross.  According to Hall, Silk maps of the area were hidden in the games along with special features as a file and a compass made to look like game pieces along with real currency hidden in the monopoly play money to aid the prisoners in escape. This was not the plan of MI-5 , however, but an idea from another branch of the British secret service.  Hall explained that in 1939, the British government had set up an agency designated as MI-9 whose primary mission was to assist resistance fighters behind enemy lines and recover Allied troops being held prisoner.  MI-9 developed the military policy of escape and evasion and that it was the “duty of all those captured to try to escape if possible.”  Hall said,  “One man who was behind many of M19’s most ingenious plans, including the Waddington project, was Christopher Clayton-Hutton.”     This  agency that assisted prisoners of war to return to England by sending advice and equipment found out that the Waddington company had the technology to print maps on on silk and made a special request of the company.   Silk maps made no noise, took up very little space and could be folded into a garment or hidden in a package of cigarettes.   A tiny compass was also hidden in uniform buttons and used as a tool for escape in case a pilot was shot down behind enemy lines. Truth or Fiction recently spoke to Bill Knowles, a former Canadian pilot who flew with the RAF on D Day who told us that any escape routes and safe house information were generally memorized by pilots by the time he was flying missions and that no un-coded information would have been printed on anything that could have been intercepted by the enemy as that could have endangered all involved in these types of operations. The British Official Secrets Act is what bound everybody involved to secrecy and we have sent an inquiry to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the UK to verify if this story has truly been de-classified and no longer confidential.

Scott     Pleus, the commanding officer of the 63rd Fighter Squadron at Luke, and     published on June 28.  In it, he explained that the flyby was in     honor of a fallen airman,     Captain Jeremy Fresques, who died in Iraq. McRae wrote a follow-up letter to the newspaper that was published on     July 9 in which he apologized for his original complaint: I read with increasing embarrassment and humility the response to my unfortunate letter to The Republic concerning an Air Force flyby     (“A wake-up call from Luke’s jets,” Letters, June 23). I had no idea of the significance of the flyby, and would never have insulted such a fine and respectful display had I known. I have received many calls from the fine airmen who are serving or have served at Luke, and I have attempted to explain my side and apologized for any discomfort my letter has caused. This was simply an uninformed citizen complaining about noise. I have been made aware in both written and verbal communications of the four-ship flyby, and my heart goes out to each and every lost serviceman and woman in this war in which we are engaged. I have been called un-American by an unknown caller and I feel that I must address that. I served in the U.S. Navy and am a Vietnam veteran.

Rampant reports have also alleged that FEMA is quietly setting up Ebola quarantine camps across the U.S. "," The Ebola pandemic in West Africa has quickly grown into a global crisis , but an Ebola zombie apocalypse is not imminent. Internet users in China coined the term “zombie disease” in August 2014, and rumors spread about the virus’ ability to reanimate its victims as flesh-eating zombies. But China’s state-run Zinhua News Agency quickly dispelled rumors of the so-called “zombie disease” sweeping West Africa. “The term — which Baike, a Chinese online encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia, even lists as a synonym for Ebola — appears to arise from the virus’ high fatality rate and the particularly gruesome death it can cause, sometimes with bleeding from the eyes, ears and gums,” according to a version of the story translated by Foreign Policy . Foreign Policy went on to explain that some people in China believed that once people die from Ebola, they can “unexpectedly reawaken, entering into an extremely violent condition in which they bite any moving object, including humans and animals.” The Zinhua News Agency cited an unnamed “expert” who claimed Ebola victims actually grow weaker because they lose so much blood and that zombie reanimation “can only happen in the movies.” But that wasn’t the end of the Ebola zombie eRumor. It came back to life on September 24, 2014, after the New Dawn, an independent newspaper that covers Africa, reported that two women had been “resurrected” after apparently succumbing to the virus in Nimba County. But the article makes no mention of “Ebola zombies,” and it’s apparent that the women likely recovered after they had been presumed dead by villagers. News of the resurrections had “created panic in residents of Hope Village Community and Ganta” who described one of the women as a “ghost who shouldn’t live among them,” the New Dawn reported. But the villagers’ panic can easily be attributed to cultural differences and the extremely contagious nature of Ebola. Nevertheless, reports of the so-called zombie apocalypse were spread by American websites and bloggers. Some of those reports included claims that FEMA was preparing for a zombie apocalypse and/or was setting up Ebola quarantine camps. But accompanying photos that allegedly show FEMA workers “quietly establishing Ebola quarantine centers” across the U.S. are a hoax.

It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the   clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that   might be perceived in that fashion.” TruthOrFiction.com contacted   the Department of Defense (DoD) and Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a DoD   Spokesman, sent us this statement: “The U.S.   Department of Defense has never and will never single out a particular   religious group for persecution or prosecution. The Department makes   reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrates the religious   diversity of our service members. Service members can   share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive   attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one’s beliefs (proselytization). If a service member   harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion,   national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action   based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious   harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the   gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. The Department of   Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military   Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and   respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own   religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The   Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization,   and provides free access of religion for all members of the military   services. We work to ensure   that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right   to practice their religion — in a manner that is respectful of other   individuals’ rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that   are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from   accomplishing the military mission.” The question in any case would be exactly where does the line exist   between Evangelism and  proselytizing?   Those who preach   the Gospel often mention the Ten Commandments, if one has disobeyed a   Commandment than all Commandments have been broken and that the wages of sin   is death. That is followed by the message of salvation, that Jesus bore   the punishment for the disobedience of God’s Law and God forgives all who   believe in Jesus. Posted 05/03/13 ","Military"

Dr. Kaku is also a professor of physics at City University in New York.     Kaku was interviewed by ABC News on November 10th. offering his reasons why he did not think that this was a launched missile.  He said that launched missiles increase their speed, travel East to West and do not alter course.   He told reporters that the object in the sky had not changed its speed but was altering course and was travelling in the wrong direction.  He also said that the contrails expansion at the bottom of the frame had given it an optical illusion of a water launch and since missiles go up into the higher atmosphere other nations would have reported a sighting on their radar.

The Marine holds that position until the president “has moved a comfortable distance       away.” Any Marines departing from that would not be disrespecting the man,       but the presidency, and that would not be tolerated.

"The meaning of the folding of the American flag-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/foldsoftheflag/"," Message alleges that there is meaning to each fold of the American flag, for example, at a military funeral when the flag is presented to the family of the person who died.  Most of them are of spiritual and religious significance. "," The meaning of the folding of the American flag that is described in this eRumor is not without importance, but it is not official and not required. Public Law 94-344, known as the Federal Flag Code, is the law of the land regarding the handling and displaying of the American flag.  It does not include anything regarding the significance or meaning of folding the flag.  The code was first adopted by Congress in 1923 and revised numerous times. According to the American Legion, the code does not call for a ceremonial folding of the flag and the folding procedure is also traditional.  Same for the meanings of the folds. Nobody seems to know when or where that originated or who wrote it.  There is speculation that it may have come from a chaplain who attached the mostly Judeo-Christian religious meanings to the folds, perhaps for a burial ceremony. Official or not, the statement has gained status as the traditional meaning of the folds and was found in many governmental and military manuals and recited at numerous military funerals. In October, 2007, the National Cemetery Administration banned the practice of giving the meaning of the folds of the flag at all national cemeteries, but the decision was quickly revised.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs issued a statement on 10/20/07 saying that any recitations at the graveside of a veteran can reflect the wishes of the family.  In other words, if the family wants the meaning of the folds to be included, it can be included. One additional note:  The eRumor says the 21-gun salute originated from adding the digits of 1776.  That is not true.  According to Arlington Cemetery, the 21-gun salute evolved from many years of various traditions of honoring dignitaries.

"Ted Kennedy Sent a Secret Letter to the Soviets in 1983-Truth!","2015-03-13 02:27:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ted-kennedy-sent-a-secret-letter-to-the-soviets-in-1983/"," Ted Kennedy asked leaders of the Soviet Union to help the Democrats defeat President Reagan in the 1984 presidential election in a secret letter that he sent in 1983. "," This eRumor is true. Sen. Ted Kennedy wrote the letter to Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov in 1983. In the letter, Kennedy reportedly talked about his concerns with U.S.-Soviet relations, and about President Reagan’s plan to deploy middle range nuclear weapons to Western Europe. Ted Kennedy’s original letter to Soviet leaders hasn’t turned up. But Kennedy’s letter was discussed in a memo from KGB Head Viktor Chebrikov to Yuri Andropov that turned up in 1992. According to the memo : “The only real threats to Reagan are problems of war and peace and Soviet-American relations. These issues, according to the senator, will without a doubt become the most important of the election campaign. The movement advocating a freeze on nuclear arsenals of both countries continues to gain strength in the United States. The movement is also willing to accept preparations, particularly from Kennedy, for its continued growth. In political and influential circles of the country, including within Congress, the resistance to growing military expenditures is gaining strength. “However, according to Kennedy, the opposition to Reagan is still very weak. Reagan’s adversaries are divided and the presentations they make are not fully effective. Meanwhile, Reagan has the capabilities to effectively counter any propaganda.” The memo goes on to discuss Ted Kennedy’s request for Yuri Andropov to invite him to Moscow for a meeting. Kennedy reportedly said that he could provide “explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the U.S.A.” Kennedy said he had similar meetings planned with British and French leaders. Ted Kennedy also requested that Yuri Andropov do a number of interviews on American television, according to the memo : “A direct appeal by the General Secretary to the American people will, without a doubt, attract a great deal of attention and interest in the country. The senator is convinced this would receive the maximum resonance in so far as television is the most effective method of mass media and information.” Kennedy also reportedly said he was “very impressed” with the Soviet’s commitment to “heal international affairs, and improve mutual understandings between people.” Historian Paul Kengor wrote about the memo in his book, “The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism.” Kengor explained in a 2008 interview how the document had been discovered: “It comes from the Central Committee archives of the former USSR. Once Boris Yeltsin took over Russia in 1991, he immediately began opening the Soviet archives, which led to a rush on the archives by Western researchers. One of them, Tim Sebastian of the London Times and BBC, found the Kennedy document and reported it in the February 2, 1992 edition of the Times, in an article titled, ‘Teddy, the KGB and the top secret file.’ “But this electrifying revelation stopped there; it went no further. Never made it across the Atlantic. Not a single American news organization, from what I can tell, picked up the story. Apparently, it just wasn’t interesting enough, nor newsworthy. Reports of the Ted Kennedy-KGB memo went viral after a group of Republican senators sent an open letter to leaders of Iran about ongoing nuclear negotiations. This sparked a debate about senators undermining presidents and brought new attention to the Kennedy memo. ","Military"
