"“Dance of the Hillary Virus” Warnings Spread on Social Media-Fiction!","2016-10-11 09:10:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dance-hillary-virus-warnings-spread-social-media/"," Warnings that a “Dance of the Hillary” virus circulating social media will “format your mobile phone” have gone viral. "," We haven’t been able to find any credible reports of a “Dance of the Hillary” virus, and the rumor closely resembles a false warning about a “Dance of the Pope” virus that went viral in 2015. The warning, which was widely circulated on Facebook in early October, claims that the BCC has reported that watching the Dance of the Hillary video would “format” your mobile device: Please inform all contacts from your list not to open a video called the “Dance of the Hillary”. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on BBC radio. Fwd this msg to as many as you can! Again, we haven’t found any credible reports of a video called Dance of the Hillary, or a virus related to it circulating. The warning is very similar to one that we investigated in April 2015 about a “Dance of the Pope” video” that we found to be “fiction”: “URGENT: Tell all contacts from your list not to accept a video called the dance of the Pope. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on the radio. Pass on to as many as you can. It was announced on the radio in USA.” It’s not clear where these fake virus warnings originated. Phrases used in the warnings like “Dance of the Hillary” and “formats your mobile” suggest that the rumor originated overseas since that’s not the way Americans talk. And it’s not exactly clear what, exactly, “formats your mobile” is supposed to mean since we couldn’t find any examples of that being used in the IT security sector. Given all that, we’re calling the Dance of the Hillary virus warning “fiction.” ","Internet"

Thankfully, Ward grew up to be a healthy little boy without any lasting medical complications. And Jordan Kaylum’s Facebook page is filled with nothing but “sick children” posts that claim Facebook will donate money to their causes in exchange for likes and comments.

"Hacker Group Anonymous to Hold Day of Rage 2016-Fiction!","2016-07-14 08:55:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hacker-group-anonymous-hold-day-rage-2016/",".gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;} (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Hacker Group Anonymous to Hold Day of Rage 2016- Fiction! Rumors that the activist hacker group plans to hold a “Day of Rage” on July 15 have gone viral. "," There’s no truth to rumors that Anonymous plans to hold nationwide “Day of Rage” protests on July 15, 2016. The rumor started with a video posted by someone using the handle “TheAnonMessage” who claims to be affiliated with the group. The video begins by showing the police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philandro Castile. Then, a narrator continues: We are calling on a collective day of rage. A day of action centered around civil disobedience and the right to protest. To police departments across the United States. We are not your enemy. However, it is in your hands if you want us to stay that way or not. We will not be silenced and we will not be intimidated. To the St. Anthony and the Baton Rouge Police Departments, we’ve already launched attacks on your virtual infrastructure. We are prepared to release every single piece of evidence that will expose your corruption and blatant disregard for human life. Once again we are calling upon the citizens of the United States, in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement as well as other civil rights activists, to participate in a day of action against the injustices of corrupt officers. On Friday, July 15th, we will all flood the streets at strategic locations in order to maximize our voice. The locations and times will be located in the description below. Tell your family, tell your friends. We will change the world together. Our freedom depends on it. The video sparked rumors and even warnings from blog sites to not be in certain cities at specific times because Day of Rage protests had been planned there (even though no dates or events were listed in the video or elsewhere), which fueled a sense of panic. In reality, however, an official Anonymous Twitter account tweeted that there’s no Day of Rage planned by the group, and that the account that posted the video, TheAnonMessage, has been behind hoaxes like this one before: TheAnonMessage was also behind a viral video that called for a Day of Rage on August 14, 2014, in response to police in Ferguson, Missouri, killing Michael Brown. That video generated a lot of attention, but nationwide protests supposedly organized by the hacker group never took place. Anonymous doesn’t have formal leadership or an official roster of members. The group is a loose affiliation of hackers that have common views and rally behind common social causes. Because the group has, “A very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives,” it’s easy for people to use the group’s name and recognition to spread false rumors like Day of Rage 2016.

"Pandora Radio Warns that Accounts Risk Being Hacked-Truth!","2016-07-12 13:01:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pandora-radio-warns-accounts-risk-hacked/"," Many Pandora Radio users have been warned via email that their accounts are risk of being hacked. "," Pandora hasn’t been hacked, but warnings about Pandora accounts that are at risk of being hacked are very real. The threat actually circles back to a LinkedIn data breach that occurred in 2012. In May 2016, LinkedIn announced that personal data stolen from about 100 million users in the 2012 hack had been posted for sale on a “dark web” site: In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members’ passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believed were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is as a result of a new security breach. Alerts that Pandora users received about their accounts being flagged at high risk for hacking stem from the list of 100 million plus LinkedIn accounts that were hacked in 2012: Our security teams have analyzed the LinkedIn credential data and our analysis indicates that your username was among those leaked onto the Internet. This username is the same on LinkedIn and Pandora. While you have probably already changed your password on the LinkedIn website you should also change your password on any other website where you used the same password, including Pandora. Password reuse, using the same password across websites, is one way that malicious entities attempt to gain unauthorized access to services, which is why it’s important to use different passwords with different accounts. So, although the 2012 data breach didn’t directly involve Pandora, the radio streaming service crosschecked the leaked LinkedIn usernames to identify any Pandora accounts that used the same user name in order to warn listeners about an elevated threat.

"Skeleton of Loch Ness Monster Found by Dog Walker-Fiction!","2016-07-01 08:23:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/skeleton-loch-ness-monster-found-dog-walker/"," Photos of what appear to be the skeletal remains of the Loch Ness Monster have gone viral on social media. "," These photos don’t show the Loch Ness Monster’s skeletal remains. The story appeared to have started with a social media post of photos that appear to show the skeletal remains (and intestines) of an animal that appears to be the Loch Ness Monster with the caption: “A dog walker out of the shores of Loch Ness has just stumbled across this. Has Nessy been found? Or someone playing a fascinating prank?” Blog sites and, most notably, the U.K.’s Daily Mail quickly picked up the story . The story was quickly shared thousands of times and hundreds of people commented, many joking that Nessy’s demise could be related to the U.K. voting to leave the European Union. The first sign that the photos aren’t real is that it would seemingly be impossible for the Loch Ness Monster’s intestines to be perfectly preserved despite the rest of its carcass having rotted away. And the final deathblow to this rumor came when reports surfaced that the photos were actually taken on a set during the filming of an unnamed television show. ","Internet"

But we do know that the NFL hasn’t made any announcement that it will ban the National Anthem in 2017.

"Disney’s Black Diamond VHS Tapes Are Worth Thousands-Fiction!","2016-06-06 13:59:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/disneys-black-diamond-vhs-tapes-worth-thousands/"," Blog sites have reported that Disney’s “Black Diamond” VHS tapes of movies like “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Little Mermaid” are worth tens of thousands of dollars. "," Disney’s Black Diamond VHS tapes aren’t worth tens of thousands of dollars — in fact, most aren’t even worth $10. Claims about the value of Disney’s “Black Diamond Collection” VHS tapes went viral in early June when a number of blog sites picked up false reports that VHS copies of classic Disney movies like “Beauty and the Beast” were worth thousands of dollars on resale sites like Ebay. As it turns out, however, false claims about the value of Disney’s Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes have been around for years. In early 2015, BuzzFeed reported that copies of “Beauty and the Beast” are worth $500 based solely on this one auction listed on Ebay. News Bake , a blog site that “disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy of the content” on its site, picked up the charge by mid 2016 with a story appearing under the headline, “If You Have ANY of These VHS’s, It May Be Worth Over $10,000.” The report included screen grabs of VHS copies of Disney movies like “Beauty and the Beast” listed on auction sites for as much as $10,000: Given that almost everybody has a box of old Disney VHS tapes in their basement, these reports generate a lot of buzz. However, because everybody has a box of old Disney tapes in their basement, these “Black Diamond Collection” VHS tapes are worth very little. Scammers can list items on Ebay and other online auction sites for however much they want — that doesn’t mean they’re actually worth that much. In the above screen grab, there were zero bids on both auctions for “Beauty and the Beast” VHS tapes. After filtering through all of the artificially inflated Ebay auctions for Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes, you’ll find a handful of auctions that are more fairly priced, like this one : Rumors about the value of Disney’s Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes can be traced back to a widely circulated blog posted at an Ebay community page in 2010. In the post, a Disney collector predicts that mint condition Black Diamond Collection Disney tapes will be worth money to collectors at some point in the future (like Red Line Hot Wheels Die Cast Cars and classic Barbie Dolls are today). The post does not, however, claim that Black Diamond Collection tapes are worth thousands of dollars, or even that they will be in the future: Black Diamond Tapes are easy to identify by the Black Diamond found on the Spine of the case with the Walt Disney’s Signature located inside the Diamond.  With a little hard work you can find tapes in good to mint condition.  While all of the tapes are getting hard to find in any condition the tapes are considered to be RARE in better conditions.  Because most tapes were opened and viewed till they simply wore out.  The cases also present a condition problem because of the plastic molding used to produce the cases.  The cases had a hallow space in between the plastic layers which wold crush are bend upon being dropped or having heavy pressure applied to it.  The cushioning supplied by this hallow space would help protect the tape but could make the case look beat up.  How many kids do you know that take great care of thier stuff to prevent damage.  I would say very few would have taken great care of thier movies.  So the vast majority of the Black Diamond Tapes and Cases were damaged or just simply wore out.  Plus the fact that in the early 80’s not every household had a VCR to play these tapes so far fewer of these early editions were produced..  All of this adds up to many of these tapes are now hard to find in any condition and RARE in in better conditions! Collectibles gain value when they’re extremely rare. Because Disney VHS tapes have been so widely circulated, most of them have very little monetary value now. Unopened or mint condition VHS tapes have more value, but only if you can find a serious collector. If all of this sounds familiar, it might be because it’s the exact same thing that happened with the Princess Diana Beanie Baby from the late 1990s. The value of the commemorative Beanie Baby has become wildly (and incorrectly) inflated on online auction sites. In reality, however, the Princess Diana Beanie Babies are worth anywhere from $27 to $47 ( click here for our previous report on this ). The same is true for Disney Black Diamond Collection VHS tapes. They aren’t worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. ","Internet"

The story was published by the website Straight Stoned on May 6th under the headline, “Pro-Lifers Declare ‘Ejaculation Is Murder: Every Sperm Cell Is a Life.” According to the report : The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice. “Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!” Within a week of being published, the story had been shared more than 150,000 times on Facebook.

"Car Headrests Were Designed to Break Car Windows-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-05-11 13:49:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/car-headrests-designed-break-car-windows/"," Car headrests were designed to break a car window if an emergency escape is needed. "," Car headrests can be used to break a car window, but they weren’t intentionally designed for that reason. Car windows are made with tempered glass , which is very difficult to break. It’s created by rapidly heating and cooling glass in a process that makes the glass five to 10 times stronger than it originally was. Car windows can, however, be broken by hard objects with pointed tips like the metal punches found on hammers that made specifically to shatter glass windows in the case of emergencies: When it comes to using a headrest to break a car window, the same principle applies. But instead of swinging the headrest like a hammer, one of the metal posts is inserted between the window and the door, and when it’s pulled on, pressure placed on the end of the metal post shatters the glass. This YouTube video demonstrates how it’s done. There’s no truth, however, to claims like this one that car headrests were specifically designed to be removable so that they’re able to smash a car window: Car headrests are detachable because they can save your life. If you go off a bridge/bank into a deep river, you can’t open the car door until the pressure equalizes (your car fills up with water) – and while your car fills up with water, it’s sinking the whole time, by the time it’s full – you’re likely on the bottom on the river, and that means you have a long swim ahead of you, and are likely to die if it’s a deep river. So, while it’s true that car headrests can be used to break windows, there’s no indication that they were specifically designed with that purpose in mind. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction.","Internet"
"Facebook Suppresses Conservative News-Unproven!","2016-05-09 13:19:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-suppresses-conservative-news/"," Former Facebook employees have claimed that the social media platform regularly censors conservative news stories. "," It’s true that Gizmodo reported that a former Facebook employee claims Facebook has suppressed conservative stories in its “trending” news section — but it’s too early to tell exactly how credible that source is. The report , which appeared at Gizmodo on May 9th under the headline, “Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News” has a number of contradictions. First, the headline states that multiple former Facebook workers came forward with allegations that conservative stories had been suppressed — yet the story cites just one unnamed former Facebook employee who reportedly made that claim: Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network’s influential “trending” news section, according to a former journalist who worked on the project . This individual says that workers prevented stories about the right-wing CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics from appearing in the highly-influential section, even though they were organically trending among the site’s users. So, given that the allegation was made by one unnamed source, it’s far less credible than if several former Facebook employees came forward with allegations that conservative stories have been suppressed. Multiple, independent sources carry much more weight when it comes to allegations like these. The report includes a second — separate — allegation that Facebook employees tamper with trending news by planting liberal-friendly stories, even some that aren’t trending at all, into news feeds: Several former Facebook “news curators,” as they were known internally, also told Gizmodo that they were instructed to artificially “inject” selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren’t popular enough to warrant inclusion—or in some cases weren’t trending at all. The former curators, all of whom worked as contractors, also said they were directed not to include news about Facebook itself in the trending module. For its part, Facebook states that it uses a multi-tiered approach to determine which topics are trending and therefore should be included in news feeds: Trending shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook. The topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, Pages you’ve liked and your location. On a computer, the topics are grouped into 5 categories: All News, Politics, Science and Technology, Sports and Entertainment. By Facebook’s own admission, popularity is just one factor that it considers when determining trending topics. So, even if the company is “injecting” stories into news feeds that aren’t already popular, that wouldn’t be very surprising considering that other metrics — timeliness, engagement, location, etc. — are also factors. There’s no proof that those have been “injected” to further a political argument. This isn’t the first time that Facebook has been accused of liberal bias, either. WND claimed in a 2015 editorial that Facebook uses algorithms, keyword searches and individual reports to identify questionable content, which means that “if enough libs gather together to report your page, even if you’ve done nothing but gore some Democratic oxen, you will eventually lose your page.” Additionally, Western Journalism reported in January 2014 that Facebook’s then-new policy to highlight stories that its programmers consider to be “high quality” led to its Facebook performance tanking while “leftist” news agencies surged: Frustratingly, Facebook itself has been less than forthcoming about which types of content it will allow users to see. While an explanation on the site offered multiple vague nods to “high quality articles,” it did not elaborate on what type of content its new algorithm favors. With more than 4 million monthly page views, it is obvious many Americans consider WesternJournalism.com a reliable and “high quality” source for news and commentary. It is also apparent, however, that Facebook embraces a thinly veiled bias against conservative pages. According to a report by the BuzzFeed Network, which publishes a number of leftist sites including The Huffington Post and Slate, its Facebook traffic has never been higher. On the other side of the aisle, though, pages with a conservative bent are losing viewers through no fault of their own. So, complaints about Facebook’s liberal bias aren’t new — and there hasn’t been hard evidence produced to support them, either. When it comes to the report that Facebook suppresses conservative stories, we need more than just one unnamed source to call it “true.” That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Internet"

The world will have a generation of idiots.” "," We couldn’t find any record of Einstein saying that technology would lead to a generation of idiots. That quote has been circulating the Internet for years, but and original source for it has never been identified, and there’s no record of Einstein having said despite Einstein’s quotes being archived in multiple searchable databases. Some have noted that the quote is suspiciously close to a fictional Einstein quote that appeared in the 1995 movie “Powder.” The movie, written and directed by Victor Salva, is about an albino boy named Powder who has the ability to sense the thoughts of those around him. In the scene in question, Donald Ripley (played by Jeff Goldblum,” compares Powder to a fictional Einstein quote: Ripley: It’s become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity. Powder: Albert Einstein. Ripley: I look at you, and I, I think that someday our humanity might actually surpass our technology. It’s not clear if the viral Einstein quote about technology somehow “morphed” from the fictional Einstein quote from “Powder,” but that’s a possibility. We did find one Einstein quote that was somewhat close to the viral quote about “a generation of idiots” during our research, however. In a 1946 letter, Einstein wrote about the “deterioration of ethical standards” resulting from technology: I believe that the abominable deterioration of ethical standards stems primarily from the mechanization and depersonalization of our lives — a disastrous byproduct of science and technology. Nostra Culpa! However, Einstein wasn’t always so dismal about the impact of technology on society. In another quote archived in Princeton University Press’s “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” Einstein alluded to the ability of technology to end wars: Technology resulting from the sciences has internationally chained together economies and this has caused all wars to be come a matter of international importance. When this situation has entered the consciousness of mankind, after sufficient turmoil, then men will also find the energy and goodwill to create organizations that have the power to end wars. Regardless of how Einstein thought technology would shape society, we’re calling his so-called “generation of idiots” quote fiction because there’s not record of him ever saying that. ","Internet"

The retailer quickly shot the rumor down and said the offer was not sponsored or authored by Belk: These scams typically encourage victims to like, share and comment on the post in order to redeem an offer for free products and services. Then, victims will be directed to a website outside of Facebook where they’re asked to input personal information or take a “brief survey.” These scams can be used for several reasons. Scammers can sell their victims personal information to third-party marketers, or they can engage in “Like Farming.” That happens when a scammer uses a fake offer for free products or services to generate lots of likes and comments on a Facebook page. Then, once all that activity drives up the page’s visibility on Facebook, the scammers will sell it to a third-party for a profit. In general, avoid any coupons or special offers that come directly from a company’s official Facebook page or website.

Or, this type of scam could also be used in “like farming,” in which scammers use fake offers for free products to generate “likes” for a Facebook page that is later sold for a profit. Avoid the free Sharpie giveaway scam, and similar offers. The best way to identify these scams is to look at the Facebook account that it was posted under. If the account is not an official or verified account of that company, assume that it’s a scam. Also, reputable companies will never ask for personal information over social media. ","Internet"

"“Be Like Bill” Meme Poses Security Threat-Reported as Fiction!","2016-01-28 12:23:42","https://www.truthorfiction.com/be-like-bill-meme-poses-security-threat/"," The Better Business Bureau warns that a popular “Be Like Bill” meme on Facebook is a clickbait scam that could harm your computer. "," The Better Business Bureau raised questions about the “Be Like Bill” meme generator, but so far there’s no indication that it’s harmful to computers. Blobla.com created and launched the Be Like Bill meme generator in October 2015. By January 2016, customized versions of the meme had gone viral on Facebook. The generator works like this: users enter their name and gender, and it generates a customized meme with advice to others, often in the realm of social media etiquette: Not much is known about Blobla.com. The website has a privately registered domain , and it appears to be run from Asia based on its default language settings. Warnings that the Be Like Bill meme generator could be harmful surfaced in January 2016 as Facebook users found their news feeds flooded with the meme. Better Business Bureau (BBB) spokesperson Katherine Hutt said the group had launched an investigation of the site and had brought unspecified concerns to the attention of Facebook: “It’s critical to read the terms of any online agreement (including privacy statements) before clicking ‘I Agree’ or sharing personal information,” says Hutt. “Many of these sites were created solely for the purpose of harvesting data for resale, and by simply playing a game or taking a quiz, you could be giving the app access to a tremendous amount of information about you, your friends, the things you like, the things you buy, and more.” CBS News affiliate KFVS reports that the investigation stems from a since-removed excerpt from Blobla.com’s Terms of Use: “You will allow us to use, edit your content with our service permanently, no limit and no recover.” To be clear, the so-called security threat was limited to those who had used the meme generator. Be Like Bill memes generated by other that appear in your news feed don’t pose any threat at all. That sentence no longer appears in the website’s Terms of Service . Bloba.com told the CBS affiliate that it was removed to “avoid confusion.” The phrase was there, the company said, so that user-generated memes could be translated into other languages. Despite widespread reports that Be Like Bill memes are harmful to computers, there’s no evidence to support that claim. It’s true that the BBB launched an investigation, but news outlets across the country “jumped the shark” by concluding that the Be Like Bill meme was harmful to computers. We’ll update the story here as it develops. In the meantime, the BBB cautions those who use third-party apps and websites like the Be Like Bill generator to read the terms of service before trusting them.

"Lifetime Passes for KFC, Fast Food Chains-Scam!","2016-01-25 14:45:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lifetime-passes-for-kfc-fast-food-chains/"," Social media posts claim that customers can redeem lifetime passes for KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy’s, Taco Bell and other fast food chains by liking and sharing the post. "," So-called lifetime passes for KFC and other fast food chains circulating social media are classic survey scams. In this type of survey scam, you’re offered free products or services in exchange for “liking” and “sharing” a post. Usually scammers will claim that companies like KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy’s are offering the promotion to celebrate a big anniversary or milestone. When it comes to lifetime passes for Taco Bell, for example, the post claimed that Taco Bell was extending the offer to celebrate its 54th anniversary. Although Taco Bell is turning 54 in 2016, the restaurant isn’t giving away lifetime passes to celebrate. After liking and sharing the post, you’ll be told to click through to a third-party website that has been designed to look exactly like the company’s Facebook page. Then you’ll be asked to provide personal information in order to redeem your “prize.” Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson warns that these scams can be used to obtain personal financial information, to bypass telemarketer “do not call lists” or to obtain personal information that can be sold to a third party. These types of scams can be used to get you to give out personal information by filling out surveys, to infect your computer with malware, or to trick you into signing up for paid subscriptions. Click here for tips on how to avoid this type of scam from the Minnesota Attorney General’s office. There are several giveaways that can help you identify this type of scam in the future. First, the offer won’t appear on the company’s official Facebook page, and it won’t come from the company’s official Facebook account. Second, the website that you’ll be directed to will have a URL that’s different than the company’s official website. ","Internet"
"Powerball Winners John and Lisa Robinson Giving Away Winnings-Scam!","2016-01-19 10:00:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/powerball-winners-john-and-lisa-robinson-giving-away-winnings/"," Social media posts claim that John and Lisa Robinson, co-winners of the $1.58 billion Powerball jackpot, are giving away cash to random people who like and share a website. "," Powerball winners John and Lisa Robinson don’t have any plans to share the wealth with random people who like and comment on a Facebook page. That rumor spread across social media sites shortly after the Robinsons claimed more than $500 million, their stake of the record-setting $1.58 billion Powerball jackpot in January 2016. The first clue that this was a hoax was a “people remaining” countdown tool displayed on a website linked to the offer. Despite thousands of people “redeeming” the offer, the countdown tracker continued to show that fewer than 100 people could still redeem it. Accounts from people who tried to redeem John and Lisa Robinson’s Powerball giveaway offer further prove that this is a hoax . One Facebook user shared the post and was notified that he had “won.” He was asked to click on a second link and to provide personal information to redeem his “prize.” Another commenter said he discovered that the site was recording the email addresses of those who shared the link. Another consideration is that the Robinsons have laid out plans for their winnings in media reports, and they never once mentioned sharing the wealth with perfect strangers on social media posts. Rather, the Robinsons planned to donate to their church, and to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, and said they would “help certain friends,” the Associated Press reports . If you shared the fake John and Lisa Robinson Powerball giveaway offer, you should log on from a different computer and change the email and password associated with your accounts. Then, you should open “App Settings” in your Facebook account and remove any apps that may have been added to your security settings without your knowledge, according to Phishlist.com . ","Internet"
"Archeologists Discover 800-Year-Old Cell Phone Tablet-Fiction!","2016-01-05 08:36:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/archeologists-discover-800-year-old-cell-phone-tablet/"," A photo showing what appears to be an ancient cell phone table has sparked rumors that archeologists have unearthed an 800-year-old phone that may have been left behind by aliens. "," Archeologists haven’t uncovered an ancient alien cell phone. That rumor started with a report that appeared on a Spanish-language conspiracy website that translates to “Awakens the Future.” The website reported that a cell phone tablet had been found in Austria that dates back to the 13th century B.C. That version of the story reported that the language on the keypad was cuneiform, an ancient written language used in Mesopotamia: Then, a YouTube video posted in March 2015 showed the same image of the phone with a narrator describing in Spanish the discovery of an ancient “tablet shaped phone.” The video had more than 650,000 views and triggered many reports about an ancient tablet phone that had been uncovered in Austria. Finally, in December 2015, the tale of the ancient cell phone made its way into English-language media thanks to conspiracy websites like To the Death Media and UFO Sighting Daily . Here’s where the story changed from an “ancient cell phone tablet” to an “alien cell phone.” Those reports suggested that the cell phone could have been alien technology: It is evident from this cell phone like device that someone with an advanced knowledge of the future created it. The language is said to go back tens of thousands of years, but I remember a drawing of it that looked similar to the writing here. I can no longer find the drawings of it, but they said it was millions of years old and found in a coal mine, but was destroyed by the tunneling later. Very cool discovery. It’s not clear where the picture of the alien or ancient cell phone came from. The language used on the keypad is in fact cuneiform , a written language used by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia, which is modern-day Iraq. But the phone appears to be made out of black plastic, not a stone tablet. In fact, the ancient cell phone appears to be a melted Ericsson S868 cell phone — not a Nokia, as has been reported — with cuneiform characters added to its keypad. Here’s the Ericsson S868: This story started out on a Spanish-language website dedicated to conspiracy theories and slowly morphed over the course of the year from an ancient cell phone to alien cell phone. All along the way, there’s been nothing offered to make us believe that the image is anything more than a melted Ericsson S868 cell phone that had cunefirom characters added to its keypad with photo editing software. That’s why we’re calling this one fiction. ","Internet"

"," Contrary to rumors, Mark Zuckerberg still isn’t giving Facebook stock to random people who share a message on the social media site. False reports of that Mark Zuckerberg would give 10% of his Facebook stock to 1,000 random users surfaced in early December 2015. TruthorFiction.com reported on those claims and easily proved them to be false. Still, variations of the Zuckerberg Facebook stock giveaway claim have persisted. One version of the rumor claimed that ABC’s “Good Morning America” had confirmed that this time the Facebook stock giveaway was not a hoax. That’s false. The show has never reported on the Facebook stock giveaway scam , so that claim is completely fabricated. Then, an article that appeared on the fake news website the Abodo Chronicles reported that Mark Zuckerberg had partnered with the online publication to “give away $4.5 million each to $1,000 Facebook users.” The (fake) story goes that Zuckerberg was tired of the Facebook stock giveaway rumors, so he decided to make them a reality: MENLO PARK, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Mark Zuckerberg is tired of the hoax that has been circulating on Facebook, asking users to share a supposed message that the Facebook founder is giving away $4.5 Million to 1,000 people. Well, if you can’t lick ’em, join ’em. That’s what Zuckerberg is doing exactly. Today, Zuckerberg announced that he is partnering with Silicon Valley-based The Adobo Chronicles  to make the hoax a reality. Again the story encourages readers to “share” a message on Facebook to become eligible for the massive Facebook giveaway. However, the Abodo Chronicles isn’t a trusted source of news, according to its “About Us” page : THE ADOBO CHRONICLES  is your source of up-to-date, unbelievable news. Everything you read on this site is based on fact, except for the lies.

This giveaway is not affiliated with or supported by the Kroger Co. in any way. We recommend not engaging with the site(s) that offer links to the coupon, or providing them with any personal information.

Earlier in 2015, a fake offer for $100 in free groceries from Kroger when you spend $110 or more went viral on Facebook. Kroger warned customers not to fall for the scam. Fake coupons are commonly used in “survey scams” in which people are encouraged to provide their personal information in exchange for free products or discounts. Then, scammers can sell that information to third parties or use it to sign victims up for expensive subscriptions without permission. It’s best to steer away from coupons on Facebook altogether.

"," The so-called 50% off Amazon coupon making the rounds is a survey scam. In this type of scam, “marks” are promised free stuff (or a coupon) from a well-known retailer like Amazon.com. You’ll be asked to “share” and comment on the offer on social media and then fill out a survey to redeem the offer. The survey will ask you for personal information that will then be sold to a third-party by the scammers, or used to sing you up for expensive subscriptions without your permission. The best way to identify survey scams like the Amazon.com 50% off coupon is to look closely at the website’s URL. If the URL does not come from the official company website, or from the company’s official Facebook page, consider it to be a scam. In this case, the so-called Amazon 50% off coupon was offered by the website www.Amazon.com-season.xyz/ . The “Amazon.com” portion of the URL is what’s known as a subdomain. Although it appears that you’ll be directed to an official Amazon website by clicking on the link, you’ll actually be directed to a different website that has created an Amazon.com subdomain in an effort to trick you. Go Daddy explains subdomains as such : Subdomains are extensions of your domain name that you can forward to URLs or point to IP addresses and directories within your hosting account. For example, you could create a subdomain for pictures on your site called “pics” that is accessible through the URLpics.coolexample.com in addition to www.coolexample.com/pics. It’s easy to create a memorable Web address for unique content areas of your site by using subdomains. You can add up to 100 subdomains per domain name. You can also add multiple levels of subdomains. For instance, you can add info.blog.coolexample.com to delve into an even more specific area of interest on your site. Each subdomain can be up to 25 characters long. Also, the scammers who started the original Amazon coupon hoax later changed the survey scam “bait” to a $100 gift card for Amazon.com. Don’t fall for that scam, either. The website is not affiliated with Amazon, and you won’t receive a $100 off coupon. ","Internet"

Please take a few minutes and send a Christmas card her way, she will love receiving cards from all over the world. Safyre Terry’s aunt and legal guardian Liz Dolder told the Washington Post that the viral campaign started after she purchased a Christmas card tree for the Safyre at a Goodwill store: “Everything is magical,” the aunt said. “I went to Goodwill and bought a Christmas card tree. And she helped me put it up. When we got our first Christmas card, she was so excited. … It was just incredible.” Dolder said Safyre turned to her and declared: “I can’t wait to fill it all up.” And Dolder told her: “Honey, I don’t think we’re going to end up filling that.” But when Dolder posted a photo online showing Safyre with the card tree, her friends came through.

"Secret Sister Holiday Gift Exchange Promises 36 Gifts in Exchange for One-Fiction!","2015-11-05 11:48:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/secret-sister-holiday-gift-exchange-promises-36-gifts/"," A Secret Sister Holiday Gift Exchange making the rounds on Facebook promises that anyone who signs up to give one $10 gift will receive 36 gifts in return. "," Basic math tells us that the Secret Sister Holiday Gift Exchange offer circulating on Facebook is a scam. If you were to give one gift for $10 and received 36 gifts in return, 34 out of 36 people participating in the exchange would have to give a gift without receiving one. Unless, of course, those 34 people each recruited six more people who, in turn, each recruited six more people to keep the unbalanced chain of gift giving alive. If that sounds familiar, it should. By definition, the Secret Sister Holiday Gift Exchange is a pyramid scheme. The Secret Sister Gift Exchange (sometimes just called a Secret Santa Gift Exchange) blew up on Facebook in November 2015. Posts that were shared among Facebook friends read: OK lady friends!! This is awesome! Are you interested in a Holiday Gift exchange? It doesn’t matter where you live — you are welcome to join. I need 6 (or more) ladies of any age to participate in a “secret sister” gift exchange. You only have to buy ONE gift valued at $10 or more and send it to one secret sister and you could receive 36 in return! Let me know if you are interested and I will send you the information. Please don’t ask to participate if you are not willing to spend the $10 and mail your gift to someone. I love getting mail so I’m totally excited to be doing this! TIS THE SEASON! This is actually not spam! First 6 friends (or more!) who commit I will private message you details! A gift exchange in which you give one gift and receive 36 in return sounds pretty attractive. If you were to respond to that Facebook post and ask for more details, here’s what you’d learn about how the Secret Sister Gift Exchange works in a follow up message: 1 Send one gift valued at $10 or more to the Secret Friend that is placed NUMBER ONE below. 2 Remove that Secret Friends’ name from #1, then move the #2 Friend up to the #1 spot. 3 Add your name to the #2 spot with your address. 4 Then send this info to the 6 or more other friends you’ve signed up with the updated info. 5 Copy the Secret Santa request that I posted and post it on your wall. It’s okay if you don’t have 6 people sign up. Just try to do your best! NOTE: If you cannot complete this, and send your gift, within one week, please notify me. It isn’t fair to the people who already have participated and are waiting fro their gifts to arrive. So, the whole concept of the Secret Sister Gift Exchange is to continuously recruit new people to buy gifts for the person on the top of the list (hopefully you). Those people will then (in theory) recruit new people to buy gifts for them, and the circle will continue indefinitely. A pyramid scheme is an illegal investment scam in which new recruits are “the base” of an investment pyramid and provide capital that is given to earlier investors who are above them in the hierarchy, according to Investopedia . In order to avoid pyramid schemes like this one, the FBI suggests that you “be wary” of investment opportunities that require you to bring in subsequent investors to increase your profit or recover your initial investment.

Jim Gray, the Democratic Mayor of Lexington, said in a statement that he had “never belonged” to the KKk and was “opposed to everything it stands for.” Others made similar denials on Twitter.

And this is just the beginning. On November the 4th we will be having a twitter storm, spreading awareness about the operation.

The general idea of this rumor — that users can determine their privacy settings by posting a statement or disclaimer in the timeline — isn’t a new one. Back in 2013, a similar rumor spread that Facebook users could post a disclaimer that would restrict Facebook from using information from their profile: As of October 14, 2013 at 5:50pm Eastern standard time, I do not give Facebook or any entities associated with Facebook permission to use my pictures, information, or posts, both past and future. By this statement, I give notice to Facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of privacy can be punished by law (UCC 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the Rome Statute). NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates. DO NOT SHARE. You MUST copy….better safe than sorry!” TruthorFiction.com also investigated that claim and found it to be false. In October 2016, another version of this rumor went viral. In that version, a Facebook post warned that there is a “deadline tomorrow” for preventing all your Facebook posts from becoming public: deadline tomorrow !!! everything youve ever posted becomes public from tomorrow. even messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. it costs nothing for a simple copy and paste, better safe than sorry. channel 13 news talked about the change in facebooks privacy policy. i do not give facebook or any entities associated with facebook permission to use my pictures, information, messages or posts, both past and future. with this statement, i give notice to facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. the content of this profile is private and confidential information. the violation of privacy can be punished by law (ucc 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the rome statute). note: facebook is now a public entity. all members must post a note like this. if you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. if you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates. do not share. copy and paste Again, there’s no truth to this new version. Facebook hadn’t released any information about updating its user agreements when this went viral, and it appears to be nothing more than a new twist on false reports about Facebook profiles going public.

"Black Dot Campaign Strives to Help Victims of Domestic Abuse-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-09-24 13:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/black-dot-campaign-strives-to-help-victims-of-domestic-abuse/"," The Black Dot Campaign allows victims of domestic abuse to draw a small black dot on their hand to silently ask for help. "," There’s a genuine effort underway to make the Black Dot Campaign a widespread solution to victims of domestic abuse, but that hasn’t happened yet. An unidentified British woman who was once the victim of domestic abuse started the Black Dot Campaign on Facebook, and it quickly racked up nearly 50,000 “likes” from supporters. According to the group’s community page: This is a campaign to help the most vulnerable victims of domestic violence. They simply draw a black dot on their hands and agencies, family, friends, community centres, doctors, hospitals can recognise this person needs help but can not ask for it. While well intentioned, a number of concerns have been raised about the Black Dot Campaign. Because it’s a grass-roots effort, many professional organizations and charities had not received training to identify or respond to black dots on the hands of domestic abuse victims. Black dots could also been seen by the abusers. Still, the founder of the Black Dot Campaign told the BBC that she started to help victims start a dialogue with friends, family and support staff: I imagined it as a tool to start face-to-face conversations between friends, or with professionals. I was basing it on my experiences and I was thinking, how could I prompt people to talk about domestic violence? A black dot is easy to make, and easy to erase. As a female, you could go to the toilet, draw one on with mascara, and then later wipe it out. Being in the centre of your palm, you could close your palm and hide it from view. As a way of seeking help, it’s not going to be a solution for everybody. As a victim, you know what triggers your abuser. So if it’s not safe to draw a black dot, don’t do it. Just because you’re a victim doesn’t mean you’re stupid – you know yourself what is safe and what is not safe. The Black Dot Campaign is a genuine effort to help victims of domestic abuse seek help, but it’s not currently a widely accepted way to do that. ","Internet"

"," Facebook post that encourages users to click a link to active a dislike button is a hoax that could infect your computer with malware. Many Facebook users have seen a post that says Facebook’s new dislike button is an “invite only” feature and they can gain early access by clicking on a link: Once Facebook users click on the link to supposedly activate the social media site’s new dislike button, they’re redirected to malicious survey scam websites, the website Hack Read reports : Once the links are successfully spread on your Facebook, the scam campaign will then ask you to fill out the intrusive surveys in an attempt to gather your personal information as well as asking for your account credentials. All of those would then be used to spam you and your contacts via email. Some links may also install malware on your computer or spread the malware through your social media accounts. However, we aren’t sure if anyone has been infected with a malware through the dislike button scam. So it is recommended that every user should stay away from these malicious links because they won’t be providing you an access to the dislike button. This is a classic example of scammers seizing on an actual news story to spread malware or steal the personal information of victims. The dislike button scam popped up days after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the site’s engineers were actively working on a dislike feature — but that it probably wouldn’t be called “dislike,” USA Today reports : Zuckerberg said Facebook is close to unveiling a button or buttons but it’s unlikely to be called “dislike.” What will likely happen is that Facebook unveils a “sympathize” button or a series of buttons that convey support or solidarity or express other similarly positive emotions. The giant social network encourages civil interactions among its 1.5 billion users. Facebook said in an emailed statement: “We have nothing to share beyond Mark’s comments today.” The possibility of a “dislike” button popped up last December during another Q&A session. In response to a question, Zuckerberg said: “We’re thinking about it.” But he made it clear that Facebook was proceeding cautiously and was not giving the concept of a “dislike” button a thumbs up. Because there’s been so much interest in Facebook’s plans for a “dislike” feature, it will probably be used in additional scams. Always visit Facebook’s news center for information about the social media site’s latest developments to avoid for falling for these scams.","Internet"

The premium gas gets refilled on Fridays, Ghalib said. Being that it was a Thursday, the pumps had unfortunately already run out of premium, he added. Ghalib didn’t even know there was a problem until the next day, when another worker at the station called him at home. Since the complaint went online, Ghalib said the station has received angry and threatening phone calls and social media messages. Ghalib said it’s crazy to think he would disrespect or refuse service to anybody, for any reason. He added that he even allows military recruiters to set up in the store and meet with recruits. Ghalib added that he understood the woman’s confusion because English isn’t his first language, so there’s sometimes a language barrier between him and customers. ","Internet"

A writer named Jim O’Neill penned the commentary in 2009. The Canada Free Press , a conservative news site, published it under the headline, “Soros: Public Enemy #1.” O’Neill argued in the commentary that the global financial meltdown, the radicalization of the Democratic party and America’s moral decline could all be traced back to George Soros: What we have in Soros, is a multi-billionaire atheist, with skewed moral values, and a sociopath’s lack of conscience.  He considers himself to be a world class philosopher, despises capitalism, and just loves social engineering. Uh oh.  Can you say “trouble,” boys and girls? Soros is a real life version of Dr. Evil—with Obama in the role of Mini-Me.  Which is not as humorous as it might at first sound.  In fact, it’s bone-deep chilling. The commentary has been circulated in chain emails that attribute it to Steve Kroft of “60 Minutes.” The confusion seems to come section in which O’Neill cites an exchange between Kroft and Soros with key passages taken out: During an interview with “Sixty Minute’s” Steve Kroft, Soros was asked about his “best year:” KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson. SOROS: Yes. Yes. KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews. SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes. KROFT: I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult? SOROS: Not, not at all.  Not at all. KROFT: No feeling of guilt? SOROS: No. That exchange leaves out key statements from Soros to make it seem like he unapologetically helped the Nazis. But In the actual transcript, Soros says: “…I was 14 years old. And I would say that that’s when my character was made … That one should think ahead. One should understand that — and anticipate events and when, when one is threatened. It was a tremendous threat of evil. I mean, it was a — a very personal threat of evil.” The exchange, as recounted by O’Neill, also leaves out a key part of the interview in which Soros explained why he didn’t feel guilt for helping the Nazis confiscate property: I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn’t be there, because that was — well, actually, in a funny way, it’s just like in the markets — that is I weren’t there — of course, I wasn’t doing it, but somebody else would – would — would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the — whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the — I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.” ","Internet"

"," It’s true that families of some Locks of Love recipients are asked to contribute a portion of manufacturing costs, depending on their financial situation. However, a viral social media posts that claims families are “charged” up to $1,000 for Locks of Love hairpieces is false. Locks of Love provides hairpieces and repairs “free of charge or on a sliding scale based on financial need of those responsible for the children,” according to its website . Locks of Love requires applicants for hairpieces to provide the family’s most recent tax return, along with an application, medical diagnosis and letters of recommendation. The group said its hairpieces have a retail value of $3,500-$6,000. It’s been reported that Locks of Love wigs cost $1,000 to manufacture, even though the hair is donated free of charge. On its website the group says, “$1,000 sponsors a Locks of Love child,” so that’s on par with the reported manufacturing costs of wigs. Lilly Robbins, the communications director at Locks of Love, told TruthorFiction.com that the group’s goal is provide hair pieces to financially disadvantaged children — but no recipients “pay” for hairpiece they receive from the group. “No (Locks of Love) recipient pays for their prosthesis. Should a family exceed the financial guidelines, eliminating them from the need to receive a free prosthesis, based on their ability, they are requested to contribute to offset the cost of production of the prosthesis. Locks of Love takes into consideration each family’s individual situation; number of dependents, extenuating circumstances and debts/expenses they have incurred,”  Robbins said. The rumor that Locks of Love charges recipients for wigs went viral on Facebook in August 2015. A user commented that she’d been told Locks of Love charges up to $1,000 for wigs made from donated hair, and the post quickly went viral: Today I got a HUGE surprise! As I was preparing our Baby Girl Shiloh’s hair to send to Locks of Love some of my wise friends informed me that they charge patients for their hair and not to give them Shiloh’s hair. Me: I asked, “patients with cancer? That we are donating hair to?” Friends: “Yes! Could charge them $1000.00.” So I just called and talked to Locks of Love and sure enough they charge people for the hair that is being donated to them!! Me: “Y’all charge? People with cancer? My 9 year old is giving u her hair!” Lady: Well, depending on how much money the family has …” Me: “Wow. Thanks, have a great day!” Robbins said the situation described in the post is false. “We are a very small office of six people who service children all over North America.

"Home Depot Discounts No Longer Honor All Veterans-Investigation Pending!","2015-08-21 10:26:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/home-depot-discounts-no-longer-honor-all-veterans/"," Claims that Home Depot veteran discounts don’t apply to all veterans, or aren’t offered at specific stores, have gone viral on social media sites. "," Home Depot offers two veteran discounts — one applies to all veterans, the other does not — so this one is truth and fiction. A Home Depot spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that the retailer offers a “two-tiered” veteran discount policy: We have a two-tiered veterans discount policy. The discount is available to all veterans on major patriotic holidays including Veterans Day, Memorial Day and Independence Day. We’re also one of only a few retailers that provides an everyday discount to active-duty, National Guard, Coast Guard and reservists, as well as retired (typically 20-plus years of service) and service-connected disabled service members, and their spouses. We do ask anyone requesting the everyday discount to present a valid military ID, including a Veterans Administration Identification Card that designates disability by including the term “Service Connected” on the I.D. Reports that the Home Depot veteran discount was no longer offered to all veterans went viral on Facebook after a user posted that he saw a store manager in Spokane Valley, Washington, deny the discount to a veteran: So I am at Home Depot today and the older gentleman in front of me shows his ID for a veterans discount. The clerk tells him he does not qualify for a discount so the gentleman asked to see a manager. They ask me to go to another line because this may take a few minutes. I tell them no thanks I want to hear this. So a young cocky full of himself moron comes to talk to the gentleman and says no you do not qualify. The gentleman tells him he has always gotten a discount there. So the moron says well we have told our people to tighten the rules and we only give what corporate requires we give and you do not qualify. The gentleman says he will then take his business elsewhere. The young moron replies that is your choice. The gentleman starts to leave and I step in. I tell the moron if one of your idiot friends walked through the door right now you would have the option of giving him a discount and with your attitude you would do it. So step over to the register and give this guy his discount. He says he does not qualify for it… The post was shared more than 200,000 times, and the rumor that Home Depot no longer honors all veterans quickly went viral. Home Depot told TruthorFiction.com that, “We can’t verify this customer’s depiction of what happened.” But a retired veteran who doesn’t have 20-plus years of service, or a service-connected disability, would not qualify for the everyday Home Depot veteran discount, so it’s entirely possible. After 9/11, Home Depot first announced a 10% veteran discount for all “active and reserve military personnel and their families” for a two-week period in October 2001. There was no purchase limit for the discount in the original offer. Then, Home Depot continued the veteran discount during specific times of the year, like on Veterans Day. That discount was for “all active duty personnel, reservists, retired military, veterans and their families.” The maximum per-purchase veteran discount was set at $200. At some point Home Depot added the every day veteran “discount off qualifying purchases for active duty, National Guard, retiree and disabled service members and their dependants who register for the program.” A screen grab of the offer from 2014 said the “Honoring Those Who Serve” discount was $500, and that a valid military ID was required: Some people have drawn comparisons between the Home Depot veteran discount and the Lowe’s veteran discount, but the stores’ veteran discount policies are virtually identical. According to Lowe’s : Lowe’s established the 10% Military Discount to support the men and women who are currently serving our country in the Armed Services1 and to honor Retired Veterans and VA Recipients.2 This 10% discount is also extended to the immediate family3 of those who are currently serving, Retired Veterans, or VA Recipients. To qualify for the Everyday 10% Military Discount, you must: Be currently serving in, or retired from, a qualifying branch of the Armed Services, or be the immediate family member of someone who is and have a valid military ID Card. Or: Be a veteran who receives VA benefits and have a valid Veteran Identification Card (VIC). We honor all Veterans on three specific holidays: Memorial Day, 4th of July and Veterans Day. During these three holiday weekends, we extend the discount to all veterans who served honorably and who present a valid Form DD214 or other proof of service. The Lowe’s Military Discount is extended to the Veteran community on these three holidays only. The Military Discount must be used on personal purchases only and cannot be used for Lowes.com purchases, previous sales, or the purchase of gift cards or services including product installations. It cannot be combined with the Lowe’s Price Guarantee, or promotions such as “Spend and Get,” “New Mover,” “Project Starter,” “Your Choice,” or discounts such as Quote Support Program (QSP) quotes. 1  Armed Services — US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Marine Corps, US Coast Guard, or the National Guard and who are in     active, reserve, or retired status. 2  Retired Veterans and VA Recipients — Veterans who have retired after 20 years of service and/or those who receive VA Benefits 3  Immediate Family — Spouses and/or dependent children (up to 18 years old.) Most of the confusion surrounding Home Depot veteran discounts appears to center on differences between the discounts offered on patriotic holidays, and those offered every day. Again, all veterans receive the discount on patriotic holidays — but only veterans with 20-plus years of service, or a service-connected disability, qualify for the everyday discount. ","Internet"
"Walmart Removes “Made in USA” Signs from Stores– Truth! & Misleading!","2015-08-20 12:05:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/walmart-removes-made-in-usa-signs-from-stores/"," Walmart has removed “Made in USA” signs from its stores. "," This rumor is true, but it’s also misleading. A Walmart memo that called for “Made in USA” signs to be pulled from stores sparked the controversy. A screen grab of the memo was posted online in early July 2015. The memo calls for managers to “immediately remove any ‘Made in the USA’ signs you have created and posted.” Naturally, that led to speculation about why Walmart made that decision: Walmart didn’t pull the signs because it’s “ashamed” of America, however. The retailer pulled “Made in USA” signs because of deceptive advertising accusations. Walmart issued the memo days after the nonprofit group Truth in Advertising (TINA) released a report that found Walmart had mislabeled  more than a 100 products as being made in the U.S.  According to the TINA: TINA.org’s investigation into the retail giant’s website readily uncovered more than 100 instances of false and deceptive made in the USA representations. The investigation revealed products labeled “Made in the USA” though packaging indicated they were “Made in China.” TINA.org also found USA product labels on Walmart.com that were in direct conflict with the site’s own specification information on the same webpage. In a letter sent June 22, TINA.org called on Walmart to remove from its site all false and deceptive made in the USA representations. The company cited multiple reasons for the mislabeling issues including “coding errors,” outdated information from suppliers, and a convoluted process by which USA labels and product specifications are handled separately on the site. Walmart said TINA.org’s letter has since prompted the decision to streamline that process. In addition, Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said that the company relies on suppliers to submit accurate information regarding their products’ origin claims. But while Walmart pledged that it would fix the problems, and has made limited progress in removing some of the false labels, the website is still riddled with USA labeling issues. TINA filed a deceptive advertising complaint against Walmart with the Federal Trade Commission, and mislabeled products can lead to steep government fines, so Walmart’s call to remove all “Made in USA” signs makes sense. The retailer also warned hundreds of suppliers to make sure products are labeled correctly in the aftermath of the report, the Wall Street Journal reports . Walmart has made public campaigns to stock its shelves with more products that are made in the U.S. in recent years, so the TINA report came as a surprise. In 2014, the company held its first ever “Made in the USA” open call for suppliers. The company said it would spend $250 billion over the next 10 years on domestic manufacturing. ","Internet"

Sick child hoaxes falsely claim that liking or sharing a photo will help a child who is genuinely sick or injured, but that’s not the case. The children who are exploited by these scams do not benefit from them at all. The little boy pictured in Teens Swag’s photo is a 9-year-old boy identified as “Jose.” Missionaries from the New Mexico Baptist church of Rio Rancho found him in Mexico in 2012 with a massive tumor, the Associated Press reports : Si Budagher, pastor of First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho, N.M., said church members spotted the boy while doing missionary work and felt compelled to help him. “He just came up to us and offered to carry groceries,” Budagher said. “The Lord put him in front of us.” Denise Gutierrez, a victim assistance coordinator for Homeland Security Investigations, said she felt compelled to help as soon as she saw photos of Jose. “I refused to believe that there was nothing we could do for this boy,” she said. Gutierrez said the boy and his parents were granted a 45-day humanitarian visa for treatment in New Mexico, and a coalition of U.S. agencies led by Homeland Security Investigations began working to get them into the United States. The church set up a donation fund to cover treatment costs for Jose, and doctors in New Mexico removed his tumor in November 2014. In reality, Facebook never donates money to causes based on the number of likes or shares it receives. Facebook encourages users to report these scams whenever they see them. ","Internet"
"Facebook Donates $3 to Rose Prater Every Time a Photo is Shared-Fiction!","2015-08-07 10:45:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-donates-3-to-rose-prater-every-time-a-photo-is-shared/"," Facebook will donate $3 to Rose Prater, a baby girl who suffered severe burns, every time a photo of her is shared. "," This scam has been around for a long time. A post claims Facebook will donate $3 to Rose Prater every time that a photo of the badly burned baby girl is shared, but that’s not true. First, the baby girl shown in the photo isn’t named Rose Prater. Her name is Ola Kuchma, and she was burned in a 2005 fire at her home in Poland. Ola survived thanks to donations made to her family, but scammers immediately latched onto the tragedy, according to a Polish news report . Scammers first used email campaigns to steal donations from Ola’s family. Then the scam spilled onto social media. Early versions of the Facebook scam said the baby’s name was Alexandra. Later, her name was changed to Rose Prater. This type of scam has become known as a “sick children hoax.” Users are shown a heart-wrenching photo of a sick or injured child and are told that donations will be made every time it’s liked or shared. In reality, Facebook never donates money to a cause based on the number of times a post is shared or liked, according to the website : People are exploiting these children by spreading their photos without the parents consent. Please do not share the photos – report them instead! Please share with your friends to raise awareness on this issue. What do the scammers get out of sick children hoaxes? They are sometimes a clickjacking scam : Clickjacking, also known as a “UI redress attack”, is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page. Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both. These type of scams can also be used to hack into Facebook accounts so that scammers can post spam and advertisements from your profile. ","Internet"
"#DontJudgeChallenge Goes Wrong, Teen’s Face Stained Black-Fiction!","2015-07-23 07:44:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dontjudgechallenge-goes-wrong-teens-face-stained-black/"," A teenager’s face was stained permanently black after she colored it with a Sharpie marker for the “Don’t Judge Challenge” on social media. "," A fake news website started this hoax. The story was published by the website TMZToday under the headline, “#DontJudgeChallenge Goes Terribly Wrong Leaving Florida Teen’s Face Permanently Black.” The Don’t Judge Challenge was launched to bring attention to “body shaming”: The hashtag #DontJudgeChallenge has taken off on Instagram, Twitter and Vine this month with users posting photos or videos of themselves with drawn-on unibrows, acne or other physical features often the targets of body shaming. Then, they wipe off their “flaws” to reveal what’s underneath. TMZToday falsely report that the challenge had gone “terribly wrong” for a Florida girl who colored her face black with a Sharpie marker and posted a selfie: Internet trending #DontJudgeChallenge goes terribly wrong for teenage Farrah Marshall of Pinellas Park, Florida when the teen attempting to do the YouTube challenge. The challenge calls for participants to mark their faces with “ugly markings” using make up or markers designed for the skin. Once the participant appears on camera with the undesireable, the participant then transitions into a more attractive person. The challenge has been heavily shared on social media and has been performed by thousands of people. Unfortunately for Marshall, the challenge did not go as planned. The teen used a Sharpie permanent black marker and colored her entire face pitch-black. When the teen tried to wash the marker off of her face, the color would not fade. The teen then dialed 911 and was rushed to Northside Hospital. According to Marshall’s mother, Sarah, she will have to undergo skin graft surgery, removing skin from her back and buttocks to replace the skin on her face. “It’s truly a tragedy. Now her face is black forever all because of a stupid challenge. I hope kids learn from her mistake” says Sarah. Sarah has set up a GoFundMe account to raise money to help her daughter fund the cost of surgery. Because Farrah will be having cosmetic surgery, it is unfortunately not covered by her health insurance. The story was shared tens of thousands of times on social media sites, but there’s no truth to it. TMZToday (which is not the same as TMZ , the celebrity tabloid site) states in its disclaimer that its stories are “a combination of real shocking news and satire news.” ","Internet"
"Facebook Hackers Are Posting Pornography-Truth! & Outdated!","2015-07-16 11:58:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-hackers-are-posting-pornography/"," Warnings that Facebook hackers are are posting sexual videos have gone viral. "," There have been lots of true reports of Facebook hackers posting sexual videos and pornography on profile pages over the years. One version warns that Facebook hackers are posting nude photos and sexual videos of Facebook users themselves. Another warns that Facebook hackers are posting pornography ads on hacked accounts. Both versions are true, but they date back to 2011. Hacking is always a threat on Facebook, but this particular warning appears to be outdated. In 2011, a Florida man hacked the email accounts of 19 women, stole nude and semi-nude photos of them, and then posted the photos as the victims’ profile pictures. The hacker, Joseph Bernard Campbell, knew the women, and he told police wanted to “harass the victims and cause them emotional distress.” Since Campbell knew all his victims, this specific case didn’t pose a widespread security threat. There have also been many accounts of pornography ads being posted on Facebook users’ accounts without permission. This could be the work of hackers, but it’s more likely the result of a rogue app, according to a Facebook forum : It is unlikely that your account was hacked. You probably clicked on a rogue app link. A lot of times things that are designed to make you want to click them end up installing an app on your Facebook account that will send out stuff. You may have clicked on something similar to what you’re sending out, or a link that has some story that tells you part and then says “…and you won’t believe what happened next” or “…and you won’t believe what this father did to his own child!” or a page that promises to enter you in some contest or let you purchase something too good to be true “So and so has to give away these 500 iPads because their boxes aren’t sealed!”… Always be careful in the future what you click on. These older warnings about Facebook hackers went viral in July 2015 after more than 700 Australian women had nude or semi-nude photos of themselves stolen from their email accounts. The photos were posted on websites in Australia and the U.S. — but they were not posted on Facebook, the Brisbane Times reports : The latest batch of nudes was shared on a forum under the banner “Brisbane girls” on Friday, linking through to a New Zealand-based online storage service with hundreds of pictures available to browse and download. Each folder of women from “Brisbane and surrounding areas” named the woman whose nude pictures were supposedly available and in many cases even listed the area she lived in. The images ranged from risque to completely naked shots, with some only showing the woman’s body and others clearly identifying her face. Forum users reacted with glee to the release of the images, with one even going so far as to label the uploader an “icon”. Another user said he was planning to set up a website dedicated to “nudes likes this”. So, hacking is always a threat, but there didn’t appear to be an immediate threat of Facebook hackers posting pornography when the eRumor went viral, so we’re calling this one “outdated.” But if your Facebook account is ever hacked, click here to report it to Facebook.

"AOL commercial email tax?-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:16","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aol-emailtax/"," An alert from Moveon.org asking you to sign a petition targeted to AOL.  The email says that AOL is going to be charging an “email tax” to corporations and other large originators of emails, which would bypass AOL’s spam filters and give guaranteed, quick delivery to the addressees.  The email objects to senders of email being divided into preferential categories and the threat that ordinary emails would be lost in spam filters. "," This story is true, although it does not mean that a “tax” will be charged to AOL members who send emails.  Apparently some people who have received this warning thought AOL was going to charge the “tax” anybody sending an email, which is not the case. AOL told TruthOrFiction.com that it is going to charge a 1-cent per email fee to commercial outfits that send large volumes of emails, but the AOL members receiving the messages will not have to pay anything and that sending emails will also continue to be without additional charge.  AOL said it “…is part of AOL’s continued effort to protect our members from spam or unsolicited e-mail.” Last updated 2/24/06 ","Internet"
