"Clinton Campaign Paid Beyonce, Jay-Z $62 Million to Secure Black Vote-Fiction!","2016-11-08 11:52:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-campaign-paid-beyonce-jay-z-62-million-to-secure-black-vote/"," Desperate to secure the black vote ahead of Election Day, the Clinton Campaign paid Beyonce and Jay-Z $62 million to perform a concert in Cleveland. "," There’s no truth to reports that the Clinton Campaign paid Beyonce and Jay-Z millions to shore up the support of black voters. Empire Herald , a fake news website, started the rumor with a story that was shared on social media nearly 50,000 times in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The story begins: Cleveland, Ohio – Beyonce and Jay Z performed for “free” at the Get out the Vote concert last night for Hillary Clinton. However, sources revealed that the power couple was paid $62 Million to perform. According to sources closely connected with the power couple, Clinton and her campaign flew Beyonce and Jay Z out to a private meeting to discuss the election. With Hillary lacking the African-American voting numbers that Barack Obama had during his 2008 presidential, the Clinton campaign made a quick and desperate move in their final efforts to secure African-American votes. “Jay and Beyonce got a call a few weeks ago from Clinton. She invited them for a weekend stay at a luxury hotel to meet regarding the election. Before Jay Z or Beyonce could voice any concerns or ask questions, Hillary pulled out a check. Beyonce saw the check first and her eye lit up like Christmas lights. On the last day of the meeting, Hillary told said to everyone, including Jay Z and Beyonce, “We definitely got the black vote now.” On the flight back to New York, Jay Z said, “You know what, Black Lives Matter, they matter because we got paid $62 Million to represent them.” Empire Herald doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake or satirical new site, which led some to mistake this report about the Clinton campaign paying for Beyonce and Jay-Z’s support as truthful. However, earlier versions of the website clearly state that it’s a “satire & entertainment” site, a s shown in this Way Back Machine screen grab from January 2016: Given that Empire Herald isn’t a credible website, we’re calling this one “fiction.”","Celebrities"
"Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Locker Room Speech-Incorrect Attribution!","2016-09-15 07:35:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-locker-room-speech-incorrect-attribution/"," In a now-famous locker room speech, Jerry Jones ordered Dallas Cowboys players to stand during the national anthem. "," Jerry Jones didn’t deliver this locker room speech before the Dallas Cowboys’ season opener on Sept. 11, 2016. A Texas man named Richie Newberry posted the locker room speech on Facebook , and it appears to be a work of fan fiction. The message resonated with fans who disagreed with players following 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s lead and kneeling during the national anthem in protest of social injustice within the criminal justice system. Newberry’s post imagines Jones, the flamboyant owner of the Cowboys, telling his players that “you WILL stand and you WILL put your hands over your hearts” during the national anthem: “You gentlemen are world class athletes, but you are also actors. You perform on a stage that is 100 yards long. Today, you play the role of a patriotic super hero. You will play this role well because you know that millions of children will be watching and looking at your example.” Then his inner fire started to shine through as he said quietly “but most of all I want you to remember, you are the actors, but this is MY stage and you will play the role I tell you to.” Within days, the post had been shared nearly 300,000 times. As more and more people read and shared the post, there seemed to be growing misunderstanding that Jones had actually given the locker room speech. And websites liked the Daily Snark falsely attributed the locker room speech to Jones in false reports, which fueled the misconception. In reality, none of the Cowboys’ players kneeled in protest during the national anthem, and Jones praised his team on his weekly call-in radio show in Dallas the following Monday morning: “I got to give a big pat on the back to our entire team, our coaching staff, our entire organization. We strongly, strongly support the flag. In every way, we support — it’s almost ridiculous to be saying it — the people that for generations and generations have given it all up so we can get out here and show off in front of millions of people on television. We respect that so much. That’s the real business. “The forum of the NFL and the forum on television is a very significant thing. I’m for it being used in every way we can to support the great, great contributors in our society and that’s people that have supported America, the flag, and there’s no reason not to go all out right there. For anybody to use parts of that visibility to do otherwise is really disappointing.” So, this locker room speech didn’t come from Jerry Jones — but, given his comments, he might agree with it.

"Jackie Robinson Refused to Salute the Flag, Stand for National Anthem-Authorship Confirmed!","2016-08-30 10:17:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jackie-robinson-refused-salute-flag-stand-national-anthem-authorship-confirmed/"," Baseball great Jackie Robinson once said, “I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag. I know that I am a black man in a white world.” "," Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play professional baseball, actually made these comments about the National Anthem and saluting the flag. Robinson’s comments were drudged up after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the paying of the National Anthem during a San Francisco 49ers preseason football game. In explanation, Kaepernick said: “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” The move sparked national debate about whether or not refusing to rise for the singing of the National Anthem was an appropriate way to protest social issues. During that debate, comments that appeared in Jackie Robinson’s autobiography, “I Never Had It Made,” were used to argue in favor of Kaepernick’s protest: There I was, the black grandson of a slave, the son of a black sharecropper, part of a historic occasion, a symbolic hero to my people. The air was sparkling. The sunlight was warm. The band struck up the national anthem. The flag billowed in the wind. It should have been a glorious moment for me as the stirring words of the national anthem poured from the stands. Perhaps, it was, but then again, perhaps, the anthem could be called the theme song for a drama called The Noble Experiment. Today, as I look back on that opening game of my first world series, I must tell you that it was Mr. Rickey’s drama and that I was only a principal actor. As I write this twenty years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world. In 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made. So we can confirm that Jackie Robinson actually wrote that he could not stand for the singing of the National Anthem.

"NFL QB Colin Kaepernick Converts to Islam, Refuses to Stand for National Anthem-Unproven!","2016-08-30 09:26:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nfl-qb-colin-kaepernick-converts-to-islam-refuses-to-stand-for-national-anthem/"," It’s been rumored that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick converted to Islam months before he refused to stand for the singing of the National Anthem in protest of racial inequality. "," Rumors that Colin Kaepernick has converted to Islam can’t be confirmed at this time. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback made waves in August 2016 when he refused to stand for the singing of the National Anthem in an effort to spark debate about racial inequality and needed criminal justice reforms, Kaepernick explained in a statement : “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Kaepernick’s statement sparked plenty of debate about patriotism, the national anthem and athletes’ role in social issues. The debate also drudged up unproven rumors from July 2016 that Kaepernick had converted to Islam, and that his protest was in some way connected to his new faith. Those rumors started after Kapernick posted a message from his official Istagram account wishing Muslims who had been fasting during Ramadan a “Happy Eid”: Kaepernick didn’t indicate that he himself had been fasting for Ramadan in the post, or that he had converted to Islam, but the post immediately sparked rumors that he had. Infotainment websites like Media Takeout (MTO) News and the Terez Owens sports gossip blog reported that Kaepernick had converted to Islam, due in large part to his girlfriend, MTV host Nessa Diab. These stories both credited unnamed “people close to the player” for their scoop, and it’s impossible to confirm of debunk unnamed sources. It should be noted, however, that MTO News has an ambiguous disclaimer that states its stories are presented “as is” with no claim of truth or accuracy. And the Terez Owens story included photos in which Kaepernick’s head had been photoshopped onto the bodies of Osama bin Laden and an ISIS terrorist. Nevertheless, these blog sites were cited as evidence that Kaepernick had converted to Islam by fringe websites like the Conservative Daily Post and the Conservative Tree House and Info Wars . We couldn’t find any credible information about what religion, if any, that Kaepernick practices. That’s why we’re calling this one “unproven.” ","Celebrities"

"CBS Cancelled “Mike & Molly” Over Melissa McCarthy’s Weight Loss –Fiction!","2016-08-17 13:49:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cbs-cancelled-mike-molly-melissa-mccarthys-weight-loss/"," Rumors that CBS cancelled the sitcom “Mike & Molly” because lead actress Melissa McCarthy lost weight and no longer fits the part have gone viral. "," Melissa McCarthy’s weight loss had nothing to do with the cancellation of her hit show, “Mike & Molly.” That rumor started with a report that appeared at TMZ News , a fake news website that is often confused with the credible celebrity tabloid TMZ . The fake report quoted a distraught McCarthy expressing disbelief over the show’s cancellation: “I.. just.. I can’t believe it! They’re cancelling an amazing show JUST because I decided to finally be healthy. It makes no sense! They said I no longer fit the part, which is outrageous. It all started when some of my colleagues recommended Garcinia Pills, something they had seen on a Dr. Oz episode. When your life revolves around being on camera and on stage, you always have to look good for the fans and for yourself. I saw a HUGE difference in less than a week!” In reality, CBS cancelled “Mike & Molly” in January 2016, and the final season of the show began airing in April 2016. Variety reported that CBS President Glenn Geller made the announcement at a Television Critics Association press tour in January: “‘Mike and Molly,’ listen, these decisions are really challenging and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Chuck [Lorre], Al Higgins, Melissa, Billy — the whole cast and crew,” he said. “But I can confirm that this will be the last season of ‘Mike and Molly.’” As for the final episode of the sitcom, Geller said, “I think the fans will be very satisfied with what Chuck and Al have planned.” Though the cancellation was a sure thing, no official axing came from the network until now. The final season, which began on Jan. 6, will wrap up this spring. The show is currently in production, with two more episodes to complete filming. The show’s cancellation was public knowledge as early as December 2015. Melissa McCarthy tweeted at the time that she was “shocked and heartbroken” over the show’s cancellation: Rumors about why the show was cancelled immediately began to stir. But Ken Levin, a writer on the show, said the show’s cancellation was a matter of dollars and cents: “A big consideration is economics, especially in Mike & Molly‘s case. Everyone initially signs a six-year deal. The six years will be up this season. This is when having a movie star as your lead becomes not such a good thing. License fees (how much the network will pay for each episode) are usually determined in advance and then putting together your cast and production crew is like an NBA franchise building a team under the salary cap. Sometimes the costs are just too prohibitive.” So, despite widespread rumors that “Mike & Molly” was canceled because of Melissa McCarthy’s weight loss, the true explanation appears to be far simpler: money.

Snowden death reports quickly went viral after a “coded” tweet sent by Snowden on August 5th led some to speculate that he’d been murdered. Snowden’s attorney quickly released a statement clarifying that Snowden was “alive and well.” Still, rumors that Snowden had been found dead in Russia persisted. Those rumors were largely fueled by Get off the BS, a fringe website that publishes a combination of news, satire and commentary from a right-wing point of view. The site published a story under the headline “Mistress of Edward Snowden Pronounces Snowden Dead in Russia” that begins: Late Monday afternoon, the mistress of the infamous Edward Snowden announced the death of Snowden, who was allegedly killed this past Saturday by a drunken knife wielding Buryat man in the Republic of Buryatia. MKRU News (Russia) reported this past Saturday that a drunken man who for some reason took exception to a man, presumably Snowden, saving his wife from drowning, attacked a woman by slicing her neck and stabbed her male companion in the thigh, who later died from severe blood loss in a local hospital. But the MKRU News story that Get off the BS links to makes no mention of Edward Snowden’s death. The story is about a Buryatia local who was arrested after attacking a group of young people at a lake with a knife. MKRU News didn’t report Snowden’s death anywhere else on the site, either. Disclose.tv , a website based in Germany that publishes articles written by its community of readers “as is” with no fact checking or editing, fueled rumors of Snowden’s death by picking up the story. That version was quickly shared thousands of times on social media. But in its disclaimer , the site states that, “All posts and media uploads on Disclose.tv are the expressed opinion of the contributing member and are in no way representative or endorsed by the owners or employees of Disclose.tv.” That means the site doesn’t trust articles written by its contributors — and neither should you.

"Tom Hanks Endorses Donald Trump-Fiction!","2016-08-03 13:38:44","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tom-hanks-endorses-donald-trump/"," Tom Hanks has endorsed Donald Trump for president. "," Tom Hanks said that America “could withstand” a Donald Trump presidency — but the actor did not endorse Trump. Rumors that Hanks had rallied his support behind Trump started with an article that appeared at Conservative 101 , a website that publishes fake news articles with a right-wing slant. The story, which appeared under the headline, “Tom Hanks Backs Donald Trump, Destroys Hollywood Libs Who Criticize Him with These 9 Heroic Words,” reports : How much do you love Tom Hanks? This abundantly talented, deeply charming actor has been thrilling audiences and moving them to tears for more than three decades now. He’s earned the trust of Americans as a decent, grounded person with a great deal of humanity and common sense. In the snake pit that is Hollywood and the liberal media, he is a beacon of decency. So it will likely not surprise you to learn which candidate Hanks plans to vote for in November: Republican nominee Donald Trump. After being published on July 29th, the story quickly spread across social media. The story was especially effective in deceiving people because it included a quote that Hanks actually made about Trump to CBS News back in April: “America’s going to be fine. We’re the greatest, most resilient nation in the history of, of civilized, in all of civilization. We’ve worked ourselves out of holes many, many times over and over again.” Taken out of context, Hanks appeared to endorse Trump with the quote. But Hanks’ was simply saying that he believed America could survive a Trump presidency, the Hollywood Reporter reports : “We’re the greatest, most resilient nation in all of civilization,” the Oscar-winning actor said Thursday on CBS This Morning. “We’ll be fine.” When the 59-year-old Hanks stopped by the studio to promote his latest film, A Hologram for the King, he was asked about the 2016 election thus far and his thoughts on Trump in the White House. “We’ve worked ourselves out of holes many, many times over and over again,” Hanks said. When asked if that meant he thought Trump would be harmful to the nation, Hanks responded, “I have no powers of clairvoyance like you geniuses in the news media.” “I’m not saying he’s going to be president of the United States,” Hanks added. “I’m going to say that we’re going to have the most hilarious September, October and first week of November in a very long, long time.

The story appeared at TMZ News Online , a fake news website that is not affiliated with the celebrity tabloid TMZ , under the headline, “John Cena reported Dead in Accident.” The story begins : John Cena died in a single vehicle crash on Route 80 between Morristown and Roswell. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics responding to the vehicle accident and was identified by photo ID found on his body. Alcohol and drugs do not appear to have been a factor in this accident. Highway Safety Investigators have told reporters that John Cena lost control while driving a friend’s vehicle on Interstate 80 and rolled the vehicle several times killing him instantly. The story featured a photo of a smashed up Ferrari that Cena was supposedly driving at the time of his death. However, a quick search reveals that the photo is actually more than three years old and shows a Ferarri 458 Spider that crashed on an Italian highway (without John Cena at the wheel). And, although John Cena did not directly address reports of his death on social media, he answered any lingering questions by posting photos of himself very much alive and squat thrusting hundreds of pounds on Twitter after he had supposedly died. Finally, John Cena also appeared on ESPN’s “First Take” after he supposedly died in a car accident to talk about his upcoming gig hosting the Espy awards.

"John Wayne: I Believe In White Supremacy-Correct Attribution!","2016-06-30 09:23:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/john-wayne-i-believe-in-white-supremacy/"," John Wayne said in a 1971 interview with Playboy magazine that he believes in white supremacy and that he didn’t feel sorry for Native Americans losing their land because they had “selfishly” been trying to keep it for themselves. "," It’s true that John Wayne made these remarks in a 1971 interview with Playboy, but some of them have been taken out of context over the years. John Wayne made the statements about white supremacy and Native Americans during a far-reaching interview that covered everything from the movie business, communism, liberals and race relations. The conversation shifted when the interviewer asked John Wayne if his “screen rebellion” was different from the rebellion of the day’s young people. The led to discussion about “a kind of dissension by rote” and liberals letting communists teaching their kids in school. When the interview commented about Angel Davis stating that revoking her teaching credentials on ideological grounds was actually discrimination because she’s black, Wayne made the now infamous statement about white supremacy, according to a transcript of the interview : With a lot of blacks, there’s quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can’t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility . I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people When pressed about whether Wayne would be equipped to make those types of judgments, he expanded: It’s not my judgment. The academic community has developed certain tests that determine whether the blacks are sufficiently equipped scholastically. But some blacks have tried to force the issue and enter college when they haven’t passed the tests and don’t have the requisite background. When asked how black people could the “background” they need to succeed in college, Wayne replied: By going to school. I don’t know why people insist that blacks have been forbidden their right to go to school. They were allowed in public schools wherever I’ve been. Even if they don’t have the proper credentials for college, there are courses to help them become eligible. But if they aren’t academically ready for that step, I don’t think they should be allowed in. Otherwise, the academic society is brought down to the lowest common denominator. …What good would it do to register anybody in a class of higher algebra or calculus if they haven’t learned to count? There has to be a standard. I don’t feel guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago these people were slaves. Now, I’m not condoning slavery. It’s just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can’t play football with the rest of us. I will say this, though: I think any black who can compete with a white today can get a better break than a white man. I wish they’d tell me where in the world they have it better than right here in America. So, it’s true that John Wayne said he believed in white supremacy. But he said that it was because white people had historically had more educational opportunities than black people and implied that the so-called imbalance would change over time as black people became more educated. Then, when the conversation turned to Native Americans, and the fact that they often played a “subordinate” role in John Wayne’s westerns, the actor replied: I don’t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them , if that’s what you’re asking. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves. When asked if Native Americans were rightful owners of the land, Wayne replied: Look, I’m sure there have been inequalities. If those inequalities are presently affecting any of the Indians now alive, they have a right to a court hearing. But what happened 100 years ago in our country can’t be blamed on us today. So, it’s true that John Wayne made these controversial remarks about black people and Native Americans in a 1971 Playboy interview. ","Celebrities"

However, Simmons’ name was quickly dropped from the post, and it was circulated without an author named throughout 2013.

Why did you write this about a bunch of boys?’ Well, my reply is I was once a little boy – I have been a brother, a father, I am going to be a grandfather. I have never been a sister, or a mother, or a grandmother. That’s one answer. Another answer is of course to say that if you – as it were – scaled down human beings, scaled down society, if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like a scaled-down version of society than a group of little girls would be. Don’t ask me why, and this is a terrible thing to say because I’m going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality – this is nothing to do with equality at all. I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men, they are far superior and always have been. But one thing you can’t do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilisation, of society. The other thing is – why aren’t they little boys AND little girls? Well, if they’d been little boys and little girls, we being who we are, sex would have raised its lovely head, and I didn’t want this to be about sex. Sex is too trivial a thing to get in with a story like this, which was about the problem of evil and the problem of how people are to live together in a society, not just as lovers or man and wife.” So, Sir William Golding’s words of wisdom about women has been correctly attributed to him.","Celebrities"

Randy Blythe and the rest of his bandmates apparently wanted to see if they could get away with accepting the award unbeknownst to the mega church pastor and it went off without a hitch. Osteen praised Lamb of God for “spreading the good word” and sharing “good christian values” in his speech when presenting the band (who performs ‘Walk With Me In Hell’) with the award at his church. The story was quickly shared on Facebook nearly 15,000 times, and many readers were duped into believing that the report was true — but that’s not the case. Heavier Metal subtly identifies itself as a non-trustworthy news source by disclosing in its About page that “We often break news stories several years before anyone else reports them, thus sometimes causing some to have a difficult time accepting the truth.” But like many fake news stories, this one has at least a kernel of truth. Lamb of God has been mistakenly identified as a Christian rock band in the past because its misleading name. When the band appeared on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2015, Lamb of God was mistakenly identified as Christian rock in TV Guide listings, Team Rock reports : Lamb Of God drummer Chris Adler has poked fun at a US TV guide that described his band as “Christian heavy metal.” They appeared on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live last night (Thursday) and performed 512 and Still Echoes from latest album VII: Sturm Und Drang. See the clips below. Earlier in the day, Adler discovered the listing while preparing to record the broadcast. The guide read: “An interview with actor Pierce Brosnan from No Escape; actor Rami Malek from Mr Robotvisits the show; a performance by the Christian heavy metal band Lamb Of God.“ The drummer posted a on Facebook, saying: “So… will you be watching? #LambOfGod on #JimmyKimmel tonight.” He later added: “Wonder who wrote that copy, they’ll be in for a surprise, ya think?” So, its not true that Joel Osteen awarded Lamb of God a Christian rock award — but the band’s name has caused confusion in the past.

"," False reports that Jared Fogle has been released from prison due to overcrowding have come from fake news websites. Former Subway spokesperson Jared Fogle was sentenced in November 2015 to serve 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child pornography and crossing state lines to pay for six with minors. Shortly after Jared Fogle’s sentence, the fake news website The News Nerd reported that Fogle had been released and would serve the remainder of his sentence from home: Due to prison overcrowding, Jared Fogle, who recently stuck a deal to serve between five and 12 and a half years in prison for child molestation and possession of child pornography, has been released from federal custody and will serve the remainder of his time on house arrest. Federal authorities stated that it is not uncommon for non-violent offenders to be given the option to serve their sentences on house arrest. Joseph Rory, a representative for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, stated, “Mr. Fogle’s case was considered carefully and it was determined that he is not a threat to society and was eligible to serve his time outside of Federal custody. His movements will be closely monitored, and he will not be allowed outside of his home for more than 1 hour per day. All efforts have been made to keep the public safe. Unfortunately, our prisons are operating at nearly 200% over capacity, and it has become impossible to continue to stuff more inmates into buildings that are coming apart at the seams.” The false report wasn’t widely shared, but when the story was re-published word-for-word in May 2016, it was quickly shared more than 50,000 times on social media sites. That story, which appeared at News 2 Atlanta , one of many fake news websites designed to look like a local television news station, appeared under the headline, “Jared Fogle Released from Prison Due to Overcrowding.” So, reports that Jared Fogle has been released because of overcrowding are false.","Celebrities"

"," Reports that Caitlyn Jenner plans to pose nude for a magazine have been circulating for more than a year — and none of them have been confirmed. The most recent rumor started with an unnamed source quoted in an US Weekly article that appeared under the headline, “Caitlyn Jenner to Pose Naked for ‘Sports Illustrated’ Cover.” The article reports : Caitlyn Jenner will appear on a summer cover of Sports Illustratedwearing “nothing but an American flag and her Olympic medal,” a source reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly. The 66-year-old I Am Cait star (formerly known as Bruce) set a world decathlon record at the 1976 Montreal Summer Games. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of her win, she’ll pose with her gold medal for the first time post-transition, adds the source: “She’s excited about that.” (Her ex-wife Kris appeared topless with a medal during a 2007 photo shoot on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.) A representative for Caitlyn Jenner declined to comment on the story, stating that there was “no comment on any future plans at this time” in a follow-up Huffington Post report . So, since reports that Caitlyn Jenner plans to pose nude for the body issue of Sports Illustrated hinge on one unnamed source, we’re calling this rumor “unproven.” And this isn’t the first time this rumor has surfaced either. It was previously reported that Caityln Jenner would be paid $5 million to pose nude for Playboy magazine, which turned out to be false. ","Celebrities"

"," It’s true that famous stagecoach driver Charley Darkey Parkhurst was a born a woman. The admission came in Charley Darkey Parkhurst’s obituary published in the Sacramento Daily Bee several days after his death on December 29, 1879: “On Sunday last, there died a person known as Charley Parkhurst, aged 67, who was well-known to old residents as a stage driver. He was in early days accounted one of the most expert manipulators of the reins who ever sat on the box of a coach. It was discovered when friendly hands were preparing him for his final rest, that Charley Parkhurst was unmistakably a well-developed woman!” As it turns out, Charley Darkey Parkhurst was born Charlotte Pankhurst. After being abandoned, Parkhurst was raised in a New Hampshire orphanage and later moved west, where he gained fame as a stagecoach driver, the Tahoe Daily Tribune reports : During the 1850s, bands of surly highwaymen stalked the roads. These outlaws would level their shotguns at stage drivers and shout, “Throw down the gold box!” Charley Parkhurst had no patience for the crooks despite their demands and threatening gestures. The most notorious road agent was nicknamed “Sugarfoot.” When he and his gang accosted Charley’s stage, it was the last robbery the thief ever attempted. Charley cracked his whip defiantly, and when his horses bolted, he turned around and fired his revolver at the crooks. Sugarfoot was later found dead with a fatal bullet wound in his stomach. In appreciation of his bravery, Wells Fargo presented Parkhurst with a large watch and chain made of solid gold. In 1865, Parkhurst grew tired of the demanding job of driving and he opened his own stage station. He later sold the business and retired to a ranch near Soquel, Calif. The years slipped by and Charley died on Dec. 29, 1879, at the age of 67. Even though there weren’t any questions raised about Parkhurst’s gender before his death, some of his acquaintances insisted that they noticed something different about him after it was discovered that he was born a woman, the Red Bluff Daily News reports : Once it was discovered that Charley was a woman, there were plenty of people to say they had always thought he wasn’t like other men. Even though he wore leather gloves summer and winter, many noticed that his hands were small and smooth. He slept in the stables with his beloved horses and was never known to have had a girlfriend. Charley never volunteered clues to her past. Loose fitting clothing hid her femininity and after a horse kicked her, an eye patch over one eye helped conceal her face. She weighed 175 pounds, could handle herself in a fist fight and drank whiskey like one of the boys. After his death, there were reports that Parkhurst’s hands were unusually small and smooth. Some also noted that he never had a girlfriend or wife. So, according to historical records, these tales about Charley Darkey Parkhurst are true. ","Celebrities"

"Rumors Surround the Death of Prince-Unproven!","2016-04-22 13:12:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors-surround-death-prince/"," After music icon Prince died in April 2016 at the age of 57, rumors began swirling about his cause of death. "," As the world mourned the death of music icon Prince, a number of unsubstantiated and unverified rumors about his cause of death began circulating. Prince’s cause of death is unknown, and it’s likely to remain unknown until a Minnesota medical examiner can complete an autopsy, which could take weeks. There will be no way to verify what caused Prince’s death until an autopsy report is made public. That hasn’t stopped people from speculating, however. TMZ reported that Prince was treated for a drug overdose six days before his death: Multiple sources in Moline tell us, Prince was rushed to a hospital and doctors gave him a “save shot” … typically administered to counteract the effects of an opiate. Our sources further say doctors advised Prince to stay in the hospital for 24 hours. His people demanded a private room, and when they were told that wasn’t possible … Prince and co. decided to bail. The singer was released 3 hours after arriving and flew home. We’re told when Prince left he “was not doing well.” That report sparked rumors that Prince’s death days later could have been drug related. Then, a follow up TMZ report that the actor had visited a pharmacy four times in the days before his death, with an accompanying image him looking frail, fueled speculation that his death was somehow related to drug use: Our sources tell us Prince had frequented the Walgreens for years — but last night, people at the store were concerned because he looked much more frail and nervous than usual. As we previously reported, Prince’s team told the media he was suffering from the flu. It seemed odd, because his private jet had to make an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois last Friday, just 48 minutes from his home. Again, rumors that Prince died from a drug overdose are nothing more than speculation at this time. The same is true for separate rumors that Prince was privately suffering from AIDS and that he died from complications of the disease. COED led the charge in fueling speculation that Prince’s died from AIDS: The cause of death hasn’t been confirmed, but what we do know is that Prince (born Prince Rogers Nelson) had been battling the flu for a couple of weeks. The flu by itself can be a dangerous illness, but it’s highly irregular for a fifty-seven-year-old man with millions of dollars and access to the best possible healthcare could die from the flu. Not impossible, just irregular. However, Prince’s death could be easily explained if it was discovered that he had AIDS. Many fans of his believe that’s the case. Reports that Prince died from AIDS , the flu or a drug overdose are nothing but speculation at this point. We’ll update this story when the medical examiner releases an autopsy report detailing his official cause of death. ","Celebrities"

"," Chalk false reports that Jim Morrison has been found living in a Paris retirement community up to a fake news website. Fake news website The Nevada County Scooper started the rumor with a report that appeared under the headline, “Jim Morrison Found Alive in Paris Assisted Living Community.” The report claims that a Paris beat reporter named Belda Sauve broke the story after investigating Morrison’s death for 45 years: “I was contacted by a nurse from Petites Soeurs des Pauvres, an assisted living hospital for the infirmed,” Ms. Sauvé told the Scooper. “This nurse informed me that she was caring for a patient named Jacques Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The patient, who is suffering fromalcoholism and liver and kidney failure, as well as moderate dementia, told her he was the grandson of the famous French post-impressionist artist, Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec. Everyone believed his story because they knew that the senior Toulouse-Lautrec was a raging alcoholic that cavorted with prostitutes.” “Over time, however, this patient would tell the nurses stories that didn’t seem to fit his originalnarrative. Stories of rock concerts, sexual orgies, and massive alcohol and illegal drug usage. At first, they brushed it off as his dementia talking,” whispered Ms. Sauvé. “One of the nurses, who had read the Morrison biography, No One Here Gets Out Alive, by Danny Sugarman, began to relate the patients stories to those in the biography. Simple addition sent them to me,” exclaimed the proud journalist. “I stopped by the hospital and interviewed Mr. Toulouse-Lautrec. We had great conversations about poetry and art, the Louvre, music, politics, and existentialism. When I mentioned Pamela Courson, Jim Morrison’s soul mate, he retreated within himself and became quiet. I sat there, watching him, silent for more than four hours, working in his brilliant but fragile egg-shell mind. And then he spoke, ‘Strange days have found me here, poisoned by an L.A. woman… waiting for the sun, amongst a feast of friends… lost in a Roman wilderness of pain… the crystal ship is slowly sinking, and the blood in the streets is up to my knees… I am ready to break on through to the other side… I see your pen and paper weave quick minarets… this is the end, my brain is squirming like a toad… Yes, I have taken a face from the ancient gallery…’ The non-sequiturs, that somehow fit, as always, continued to fly for an hour.” The story was quickly shared more than 18,000 times on social media. But The Nevada County Scooper is far from a credible news source, according to its disclaimer : This website is satirical in scope and intent. It provides fake news and social criticism in a satirical setting. If this offends you, you might want to consider doing something else with your time rather than looking at the Internet. Really, the quality of your life will improve dramatically. Our intention is not to fool anyone, but if you do get fooled,  don’t sweat it. Please have fun and lighten up and watch out for Snopes.com. We’re not sure they’ve had all their vaccinations. Questions about Jim Morrison’s death have persisted over the years, but there’s been no conclusive evidence to disprove that Morrison died in a bathtub of heart failure in July 1971. In 2007, a former Paris nightclub manager claimed that Jim Morrison actually died of a heroin overdose in a toilet stall of the club. Two drug dealers dragged Morrison’s body back to his apartment and put him into a bathtub in a last-ditch attempt to revive him, the Associated Press reports . Another theory is that Jim Morrison mistook a pile of heroin for cocaine and died after snorting it. But again, there’s no hard evidence to prove that. No autopsy was performed on Jim Morrison, and Paris prosecutors have said that it’s not likely that a new investigation into his cause of death will be opened. ","Celebrities"

"Donald Trump’s Tower Air Transported Soldier from Gulf War-Reported as Fiction!","2016-03-04 13:24:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trumps-tower-air-transported-soldier-gulf-war/"," Tower Air, an airline supposedly owned and operated by Donald Trump in the 1990s, gave free rides to stranded veterans returning from the Gulf War. "," There’s no record of an airline owned by Donald Trump giving veterans free rides home from the Middle East. We looked into whether Trump Shuttle, Donald Trump’s now-defunct airline, gave soldiers free flights. We also looked into whether Donald Trump was involved with Tower Air, an airline that contracted with the Department of Defense to transport soldiers in the early 90s. In both cases, we found the answer to be “no.” The claim emerged in a widely circulated open letter by a man named Ron Knouse that argues Donald Trump’s airline, Trump Shuttle, provided free flights to veterans returning from Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s. In the letter, Knouse claims that Trump’s airline gave stranded soldiers free transport home, but that media outlets had failed to report on his good deed. First, it’s true that Donald Trump briefly operated an airline, Trump Shuttle. NYC Aviation , a website that caters to aviation enthusiasts, has a nice summary of Trump’s journey into the airline industry, here . Trump acquired Eastern Airlines Air Shuttle for $380 million and rebranded it as Trump Shuttle, with the first flight taking off in 1989, NYC Aviation reports: Timing is everything in business, and unfortunately for Trump he entered the airline game at the wrong time. The US entered an economic recession in the late-‘80’s leading many corporations to cut back on business travel. In addition, tensions in the Middle East leading up to the first Gulf war caused oil prices to spike. This 1-2 punch was devastating for the airline industry and led to the demise of a number of airlines including Eastern and Pan Am. Given these circumstances, the Trump Shuttle lost money, and with Trump continuing to accumulate debt in his other ventures it was becoming increasingly difficult to pay back the loans taken to purchase the airline. Trump defaulted on his loan for the airline in September 1990, the story goes, and a group of banks led by Citibank sold it to USAir Group. So, Trump wasn’t in control of the airline in 1991 when soldiers were supposedly flown home from the Gulf War. Beside that, Trump Shuttle only provided service in the American Northeast, so there’s no way it would have traveled to Saudi Arabia. That tells us there’s no way that Ron Knouse’s simply mistook “Trump Shuttle” as “Tower Air” in the letter. Tower Air, on the other hand, did contract with the Department of Defense to provide charter flights around the time of the Gulf War, according to a New York Times report. But we weren’t able to find anything linking Trump to Tower Air. Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi and Sam Fondlierprovid established the airline in 1982, Airline History records show. Tower Air provided passenger service from New York to Brussels and Tel Aviv, a line previously operated by Metro International Airways, according to the World Airline Directory . The airline officially declared bankruptcy in 2000. At the time, Morris Nachtomi was listed as the airline’s CEO in a New York Post report . We couldn’t find anything linking Donald Trump to the airline in the nearly 20 years that it was operational. For all those reasons, we’re calling this one fiction. ","Celebrities"
"Nike Wouldn’t Let Steph Curry Put Bible Passage on Shoes-Fiction!","2016-03-02 08:11:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nike-wouldnt-let-steph-curry-put-bible-passage-shoes/"," Nike wouldn’t let Steph Curry put his favorite Bible verse, Philippians 4:13, on his signature basketball shoes, so the NBA star signed a deal with Under Armour instead. "," Claims that Steph Curry passed on a Nike endorsement deal because the company wouldn’t let him put his favorite Bible verse on his signature shoes are false. Rumors about Steph Curry and Nike spread across social media after this post surfaced on February 18, 2016: a Within weeks, the post had been shared more than 170,000 times, and many believed that it was true. However, the post doesn’t cite any sources to back the claim up, and it’s the only account of Steph Curry’s so-called fallout with Nike on the Internet. There are, however, many credible accounts of Curry parting ways with Nike after the company refused to invest heavily in him before he became a star. In reality, Steph Curry didn’t pass on Nike — it was Nike that passed on Steph Curry. Curry was drafted in 2009 and wore Nike shoes for the first four years of his career. Then, in 2013, Nike offered Curry a $2.5 million sponsorship deal (small in terms of shoe deals) because the company was unsure that people would actually buy his shoes. Instead, Curry signed with Under Armour for $4 million, ESPN’s Darren Rovell reports: Two years ago, Nike had a chance to pay Curry a lot of money and lock him up for the future. After offering less than $2.5 million a year, Nike had a second chance — this time to match Under Armour’s offer. Unsure that Curry would ever be able to sell signature shoes, Nike let him go. Curry remembers the moment but doesn’t talk much about it, choosing today to focus more on the company that did believe in him, the company that did pay him what he was worth (and is now getting a bargain). Today, Curry is a star. His Under Armour “Curry One,” which debuted around the NBA All-Star Game in February, is giving more credibility to the brand at retail than any endorser, across all sports, it has ever had. Thanks to the Steph Curry endorsement, Under Armour’s shoe sales soared. In 2015, Under Armour re-signed Curry, but this time he was given a lot more than $4 million. He received an equity stake of the $7.5 billion company, which will likely make the deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars, ESPN reports . But is true that Steph Curry’s signature Under Armour shoes have his favorite verse stamped on them. Curry was asked why there was a 4:13 stamped on the tongue of his shoes in February 2015, Rapzilla reports : “That’s a good question,” the Golden State Warriors point guard said. “Glad you asked.” And there it was, playing out just how he drew it up. “It represents a Bible verse I wear on my shoe,” Curry said. “Philippians 4:13. It says ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’ It’s also my mantra, how I get up for games and why I play the way I do.” The new Curry One, set for a Feb. 13 release, is a proclamation that he’s arrived as an NBA star, and he’s a different kind of star. His new shoe is a microcosm for how he approaches this pedestal his sweet jumper has propped him on. It’s his latest example of how his amazing story is part of a divine plan. For Curry, the shoe represents overcoming, considering not that long ago he was all but written off due to repeated ankle injuries. It represents sacrifice, as he traded in credibility and global reach by shockingly leaving Nike. It also represents ministry, which is why Curry’s new sneaker is dripping with spiritual innuendo. “It’s part of my DNA, who I am,” Curry said. “To have that come out in my vision for my first shoe is special.” So, Steph Curry’s favorite Bible verse is on his shoes, but that’s not why he chose Under Armour over Nike.

A story appearing under the headline, “Woman Claims She is the Daughter of Marilyn Monroe and JFK,” reports : Burbank, California| A 53-year old woman has presented a paternity action lawsuit this morning before the California state court, alleging that she is the biological daughter of Marilyn Monroe and former President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Gladys Baker Morris spent most of her life believing that Marilyn Monroe’s cousin, Meredith Baker, was her biological mother.  In March 2014, while on her deathbed, her “mother” told her that she had actually been adopted, and that her biological parents were incredibly famous. A middle-aged woman who looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe appears with the story, and it’s supposedly Gladys Baker Morris. But the woman in the photo is actually Susan Griffins , a California woman who has made millions impersonating Marilyn Monroe in movies, TV shows and ads. She does not claim to be the daughter of Marilyn Monroe and JFK, for the record.

"," A fake news website is behind false reports that Cam Newton was arrested for fixing the Super Bowl. Fake news website Daily Media Buzz published an article headlined, “Cam Newton Arrested for Fixing Super Bowl, He Won 100 Million Betting on Broncos,” that reported Carolina’s young quarterback and nine other people had been arrested for fixing Super Bowl 50: Police have arrested Cam Newton his father, his uncle Richie and seven other people, including four panthers players, over allegations of a football betting scam in which they fixed the 2016 super bowl. It is believed that there was a pattern of irregular betting, with stakes being put on the Denver Broncos at the last minute totaling 100 Million. These were done by several different accounts owned by Newtons family and linking back to Cam. Other red flags were raised by Cam’s questionable gameplay by poorly throwing several passes and making no attempt to recover a fumble. The website doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake or satirical news publication. But a quick glance at its content tells the story. Another fake story claims that Cam Newton and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning got into a fight during Super Bowl 50 after Newton threw a punch.

"," Tom Hanks’ father wasn’t a member of The Diamonds. That rumor has persisted for years, but the band’s late lead singer and founder, “Diamond” Dave Somerville, was not Tom Hanks’ father. Dave Somerville died at the age of 81 in July 2015. The singer’s obituary provides a definitive accounting of The Diamonds, and Somerville’s life, and Tom Hanks is not a part of it. Somerville had one child, a son named David Orlando, according to his obituary . Tom Hanks’ actual father was a chef named Amos Hanks, according to his biography : Thomas J. Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. Tom was raised by Amos Mefford Hanks, a cook and restaurant manager, and Janet (Turner) Hanks, a hospital worker. His parents divorced when he was 5, and his father took him along with his three siblings, Sandra, Larry and Jim, to Reno, Nevada. Because his father was an itinerant cook, Tom had to move quite often in his childhood. The family eventually settled in Oakland, California, where Tom attended and graduated from Skyline High School in 1974.

"Donald Trump, Trump Family Members, Members of KKK-Fiction! & Unproven!","2016-01-20 13:15:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donald-trump-trump-family-members-members-of-kkk/"," Accusations that Donald Trump is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, or that Trump’s father was a member of the KKK, have gone viral. "," Accusations about the Trump family’s ties to the Ku Klux Klan are both false and unproven. These accusations surfaced in September 2015 after a New York Times report was unearthed from 1927 that identified a man named Fred Trump, the name of Donald’s father, among those arrested in a brawl between KKK members and the NYPD. Fred Trump’s address was the same as an address he listed in Census records, but other details of the arrest are unclear, Boing Boing reports : In an article subtitled “Klan assails policeman”, Fred Trump is named in among those taken in during a late May “battle” in which “1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all.” At least two officers were hurt during the event, after which the Klan’s activities were denounced by the city’s Police Commissioner, Joseph A. Warren. “The Klan not only wore gowns, but had hoods over their faces almost completely hiding their identity,” Warren was quoted as saying in the article, which goes on to identify seven men “arrested in the near-riot of the parade.” Named alongside Trump are John E Kapp and John Marcy (charged with felonious assault in the attack on Patrolman William O’Neill and Sgt. William Lockyear), Fred Lyons, Thomas Caroll, Thomas Erwin, and Harry J Free. They were arraigned in Jamaica, N.Y. All seven were represented by the same lawyers, according to the article. The final entry on the list reads: “Fred Trump of 175-24 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, was discharged.” In 1927, Donald Trump’s father would have been 21 years old, and not yet a well-known figure. Multiple sources report his residence at the time—and throughout his life—at the same address. The NYPD has said that police reports from the incident are unavailable, and it’s unclear why Fred Trump was arrested, and what his involvement was. Given that Trump could have been an innocent bystander who got tangled up in the melee, or that he could have been fighting against KKK members, the accusation that he was a member of the KKK is unproven. Donald Trump also directly denied the accusations in an interview with the New York Times : It never happened. And by the way, I saw that it was one little website that said it. It never happened. And they said there were no charges, no nothing. It’s unfair to mention it, to be honest, because there were no charges. They said there were charges against other people, but there were absolutely no charges, totally false. Somebody showed me that website — it was a little website and somebody did that. By the way, did you notice that there were no charges? Well, if there are no charges that means it shouldn’t be mentioned. Because my father, there were no charges against him, I don’t know about the other people involved. But there were zero charges against him. So assuming it was him — I don’t even think it was him, I never even heard about it. So it’s really not fair to mention. It never happened. Then, also in September 2015, a fake news website reported that Anonymous, the activist group of hackers, had outed Donald Trump as a member of the KKK. The Celebricity story quoted Trump as saying; “Everyone knows my dad was a Klansmen and it runs in the family but Look people…just because I’m an active KKK member doesn’t mean I’m a racist, I mean if Obama is a Muslim then why can’t I be apart of a brotherhood and have pride in my white heritage? If Obama shows me his birth certificate I will disassociate myself with the Klan, they do a lot of good for my community just like the people of Islam do on Obama’s behalf” A self-described Anonymous member did release a list of senators and mayors who were supposedly found to be members of the KKK in September 2015, but Trump wasn’t on it. Besides, we investigated claims about politicians being tied to the KKK and found them to be fiction ( you can read that story here ). ","Celebrities"

"," False reports of Metallica suing an 8th grader were started by a fake news website. The website, called The Hard Times , reported that a “team of high-powered attorneys” representing Metallica had filed paperwork to sue an 8th grader from Wisconsin for drawing the band’s logo on a notebook: The case against 13-year-old Willy Yang was filed after the band discovered a photo of the notebook in question on Yang‘s Instagram account with the caption “No one listens to REAL music anymore #metallica #entersandman #boredatschool.” “We’ve been keeping on eye on Mr. Yang for quite some time,” said Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich in prepared remarks. “He knows he looks like an innocent little kid and he uses that to his advantage. But this isn’t the first time he has infringed on Metallica’s intellectual property. Just last month he used some of our lyrics in an essay about Ernest Hemingway. This shows a pattern of plagiarism and disrespect for U.S. copyright law, and we will seek damages.” Within a day of being posted in January 2016, the story had been shared more than 47,000 times on social media sites. Many mistook the satirical report for an actual news report. Hundreds of angry readers commented on the story with remarks like, “Shame on you, Metallica!” A quick glance at the The Hard Time s’ “ About” page reveals that it’s a little known “satire site” that caters to “punk and hardcore” music scenes. The fake news story parodies Metallica’s crusade against music piracy on file-sharing website like Napster. The band sued Napster in April 2000, and it also tracked down the user names of 335,000 fans that had pirated Metallica’s music through Napster, Ultimate Classic Rock reports : The backlash was immediate and severe against Metallica, perhaps because to bolster their case, the band tracked down 335,000-plus usernames of people they alleged downloaded their music illegally and asked Napster to block them. (The company complied.) As a result, the lawsuit started being seen as a personal attack against fans or a greedy move, not a matter of principle or a disagreement between businesses. “Some artists are in it for the pure art of music. Others are in it for the money,” student Wayne Chang, who managed Napster’s online community bulletin boards, told CNET. “Metallica just showed which side of the line they’re on.” Over the last 16 years, Metallica’s stand against music piracy and its own fans, has become a big part of the band’s identity. The fact that people believe this false report that Metallica was suing an 8th grader for drawing its logo on a notebook is proof of that. ","Celebrities"

"“Monkey Wrench” a Derogatory Term for Inventor Jack Johnson-Fiction!","2015-12-16 08:10:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/monkey-wrench-name-insult-to-inventor-jack-johnson/"," “Monkey wrench” is a derogatory term meant to insult the African heritage of the tool’s inventor, Jack Johnson. "," The term “monkey wrench” is not a derogatory slight to Jack Johnson. Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion did, however, patent improvements to the “double acting wrench” in April 1922. In his patent application , Johnson explained the improvements to the tool commonly known as the monkey wrench as such: My invention relates to improvements in wrenches and has for its object to provide an improved wrench, which is of simple and durable construction, reliable in operation and easy and inexpensive to manufacture, which may be easily and readily adjusted and which is adapted-to exert a powerful gripping action upon the work. Another objective is to provide an improved wrench of this character which in assembly presents a substantially unitary structure and which may be easily dissembled for purposes of replacement or repair. Monkey wrenches had been in use long before Jack Johnson filed that patent, and there are a number of theories about how the term “monkey wrench” came to be. The term seems to have carried different meanings at different points in history, but the idea it was ever a derogatory reference to Jack Johnson’s African-American heritage is false. A Baltimore mechanic named Charles Moncky invented the monkey wrench around 1858. The tool was originally named by using a “purposeful misspelling” of its inventor’s name, according to the Ferris State University Jim Crow Museum . A number of patents filed in the years that followed made improvements to the wrench, and it became commonly used for steam locomotives and railroad car repair work. As time passed, Charles Moncky, the original inventor of the monkey wrench, was largely forgotten. And the term “monkey wrench” slowly took on new meanings. There are theories that the name came to refer to the low status of shop workers who used them, or that the “monkeying” action used to loosen fittings with the wrench’s open jaws gave the wrench its name, the National Museum of American History reports : The term “monkey” wrench may have come from the lowly place in the shop-tool hierarchy that a monkey wrench occupied: a skilled mechanic used a monkey wrench only when a solid, open-end wrench was not available to properly fit a bolt or nut in question, or when the head of the bolt or size of the nut was non-standard. The jaws of a monkey wrench were only grossly adjustable (unlike the fine adjustment on a modern crescent wrench) and usually made a poor or loose fit on the nut or bolt head. “Monkeying” off a nut or bolt with such a wrench often involved several tries to get the wrench to fit without its slipping off. Also, the shape of the head lent itself to be using impromptu as a hammer, which of course damaged the wrench, causing the adjustment of its jaws to become even looser. If a wrench slipped off a nut or bolt head — as monkey wrenches were prone to do — injury to the user was often the result. Today, Jack Johnson is known for being the world’s first black heavyweight boxing champion — not an inventor. But Jack Johnson was also awarded two patents for a “theft-preventing device for vehicles.” The device was designed to the block a car’s fuel supply when used by an unauthorized person.

"Cam Newton Gets Fined for Giving Children Footballs-Fiction!","2015-12-15 13:43:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cam-newton-gets-fined-for-giving-children-footballs/"," Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton gets fined $5,512 each time he gives a football to a child in the stands and has paid $253,552 in fines to date for doing it. "," Cam Newton has never been fined for giving footballs to children in the stands after scoring touchdowns. There’s a $5,787 NFL fine for sending a ball into the stands on purpose, but it doesn’t apply to touchdown celebrations. That means Cam Newton doesn’t get fined every time that he gives a kid a football after a touchdown. The NFL releases a list of all the fines it levies , and just two players had been fined for sending a football into the stands in 2015: A.J. Green and Jordand Matthews. Considering that Cam Newton hands a ball off to a kid in the stands after every rushing touchdown, he would have appeared on that list multiple times if this rumor had been true. Cam Newton has been known for giving footballs to kids after touchdowns ever since his rookie season in 2011. Newton told the Charlotte Observer that he started the tradition after it was suggested to him by the team’s quarterback coach: When Newton scored against Washington in a home game Oct. 23, 2011, he still had the ball he scored with in his hand as he began the “Superman” routine. Shula’s voice, as usual, was being piped directly into Newton’s helmet headset – that is a standard NFL routine to allow play calls to get to the quarterback more easily. Recounted Newton shortly after the game: Shula “says when you celebrate, it’s not a celebration unless you give back. He says, ‘You do all that riffraff, whatever you do, but at the end you give that football to a little kid. You find a little kid. “So after I did whatever I did,” Newton continued, “I heard somebody (Shula) in my headset saying, ‘Give it to a little kid! Give it to a little kid!’ I looked and there was this kid just gleaming from ear to ear, so I gave it to him.” Cam Newton has scored many times since then, and he has never been fined for giving a ball to a child afterwards.

"Mark Zuckerberg Isn’t Really “Giving Away” $45 Billion-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-12-07 10:23:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mark-zuckerberg-isnt-really-giving-away-45-billion/"," Critics argue that Mark Zuckerberg isn’t really “giving away” 99% of his Facebook stock (about $45 billion), as he announced in December 2015. "," After Mark Zuckerberg announced that he plans to “give away” 99% of his Facebook stock, critics argued that Zuckerberg wouldn’t exactly be “giving away” his fortune because of the business model that Zuckerberg plans to use. Claims that Mark Zuckerberg isn’t really giving away $45 billion aren’t true or false. The answer falls somewhere in between because of complicated laws that define limited liability companies (LLCs) and 501c3 organizations (non-profit charities). We’ll lay out the facts and let you decide if claims about Mark Zuckerberg’s plans to “give away” $45 billion are closer to truth or fiction. First, we’ll start from the beginning. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they would donate 99% of their Facebook stock (about $45 billion) to “advancing human potential and promoting equality” in a letter to their newborn daughter on December 1, 2015. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg described the letter as such: Priscilla and I are so happy to welcome our daughter Max into this world! For her birth, we wrote a letter to her about the world we hope she grows up in. It’s a world where our generation can advance human potential and promote equality — by curing disease, personalizing learning, harnessing clean energy, connecting people, building strong communities, reducing poverty, providing equal rights and spreading understanding across nations. We are committed to doing our small part to help create this world for all children. We will give 99% of our Facebook shares — currently about $45 billion — during our lives to join many others in improving this world for the next generation. Thank you to everyone in this community for all your love and support during the pregnancy. You’ve given us hope that together we can build this world for Max and all children. After Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan announced that they would giveaway 99% of their Facebook stock, critics came forward to argue that the couple wasn’t exactly “giving away” their fortune. Because Zuckerberg’s Facebook stock will be meted out through a limited liability company (LLC) instead of a 501c3 (non-profit organization),they argue, Zuckerberg will still be able to use the money to invest in private companies, lobby politicians and donate to political campaigns. He’ll also be able to write checks from the LLC to anybody, including himself. Under the LLC structure, there’s also no board of directors to report to, federal disclosure requirements or minimum charitable contributions that need to be made each year, critics argue. James Kwak, an associate professor at the UConn Law School, called Zuckerberg’s decision to set up an LLC a “$45 billion loophole” in a blog post : Essentially, Zuckerberg can do everything with the LLC’s money that he can do with his own money. So on the most substantive level, he hasn’t done anything except announce some vague intentions. The “99%” claim made a lot of headlines, but there’s a lot less there than meets the eye. A lot of things that other billionaires do with their own money—like invest in other companies—Zuckerberg can now do with the LLC’s money. The only thing he seems to be saying is that he and his family will restrict their personal consumption to 1% of his fortune (about $450 million), but even that is not entirely clear. He certainly retains the ability to take money back out whenever he wants, and the LLC will almost certainly do some things that really are personal consumption (like political contributions). In addition, whenever the LLC makes a contribution to a real charity, the associated tax deduction will flow back up to Zuckerberg and Chan. So to the extent that they have to sell stock to pay for their consumption, they will never pay tax on those sales. (Put another way, their remaining $450 million, as well as any money they make in the future, is now all after-tax money.) Mark Zuckerberg responded to the criticism by explaining the decision to set up an LLC rather than a 501c3 nonprofit. In a follow-up Facebook post , Zuckerberg said that he had decided to forgo the tax advantages of establishing a non-profit organization to support charitable causes because an LLC would give him more flexibility to champion causes. Zuckerberg also said that proceeds from the LLC’s investments in private companies would also be devoted to charitable causes, which is another benefit of an LLC: The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is structured as an LLC rather than a traditional foundation. This enables us to pursue our mission by funding non-profit organizations, making private investments and participating in policy debates — in each case with the goal of generating a positive impact in areas of great need. Any net profits from investments will also be used to advance this mission. By using an LLC instead of a traditional foundation, we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively. In fact, if we transferred our shares to a traditional foundation, then we would have received an immediate tax benefit, but by using an LLC we do not. And just like everyone else, we will pay capital gains taxes when our shares are sold by the LLC. What’s most important to us is the flexibility to give to the organizations that will do the best work — regardless of how they’re structured. For example, our education work has been funded through a non-profit organization,Startup:Education, the recently announced Breakthrough Energy Coalitionwill make private investments in clean energy, and we also fund public government efforts, like the CDC Ebola response and San Francisco General Hospital. In the end, there’s no reason to call Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that he’ll give away 99% of his Facebook stocks “false.” But it’s not accurate to say that Zuckerberg has already “given away” $45 billion of his wealth to charitable causes yet, either. That’s why we’re classifying this one as “truth and fiction.” ","Celebrities"

"," Keanu Reeves didn’t write an inspirational open letter about life and loss that went viral on social media sites. The open letter went viral after it appeared at Keanu Reeves Online , an unofficial Facebook fan page for the actor, on November 21, 2015. In the letter, Keanu Reeves (supposedly) writes about his early life, living with dyslexia and losing the woman that he loved: “Most people know me, but don’t know my story. At the age of 3, I watched my father leave. I attended four different high schools and struggled with dyslexia, making my education more challenging than it is for most. At the age of 23, my closest friend River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. In 1998, I met Jennifer Syme. We fell instantly in love and by 1999, Jennifer was pregnant with our daughter. Sadly, after eight months, our child was born stillborn. We were devastated by her death and it eventually ended our relationship. 18 months later, Jennifer died in a car accident. Since then I avoid serious relationships and having kids. My younger sister had lukemia. Today she is cured, and I donated 70% of my gains from the movie Matrix to Hospitals that treat leukemia. I am one of the only Hollywood stars without a Mansion. I don’t have any bodyguards and do not wear fancy clothes. And even though I’m worth $100 million, I still ride the subway and I love it! The inspirational open letter about Keanu Reeves’ life quickly went viral. That’s due in large part to the fact that many people think Keanu Reeves Online is the actor’s official Facebook page, but that’s not the case. The page clearly states that it’s in no way linked to Keanu Reeves: This is a Keanu Reeves Fan Page. We are not associated with the real Keanu Reeves in any way. We just quote what we read and spread positivity. Keanu Reeves Online posts a lot of pictures of Keanu Reeves and inspirational or positive messages about life. These messages often appear in quotation marks and don’t list an author, so it’s easy to assume that the passages were written or spoken by Keanu Reeves. In reality, Keanu Reeves has refused to talk about his personal life, so him writing an unprompted open letter about his biggest struggles would have been very unusual. A Keanu Reeves profile that appeared in the magazine Details in 2008 touches on the actor’s refusal to talk about his personal life: He remains stoic in his refusal to talk about his personal life. (There are reasons to remain stoic. In 1999 he lost a daughter with his girlfriend, actress Jennifer Syme; the baby was stillborn. Almost two years later Syme died in a car accident in Los Angeles. To ask him about these things would seem merely cruel.) Later in the day Keanu notices the query GIRLFRIEND? scribbled on a page of my legal pad. He answers, politely and preemptively, like this: “No.” “No you don’t have a girlfriend or no you don’t want to get into it?” “No,” he says. “All of its implications.” There have been a number of celebrity pranks similar to this one. It was falsely reported that Richard Gere gave food and $100 to every homeless person in New York, and that Jennifer Anniston donated food and clothes to a homeless single mom who she met on the street. These hoaxes could be simply designed to draw a response from celebrities, or to make celebrities “look bad” when they debunk rumors about their over-the-top kindness. So, the inspirational open letter that appeared at Keanu Reeves Online covers actual events from the actor’s life, but it wasn’t actually written by Keanu Reeves. At this point, the letter’s actual author isn’t known. ","Celebrities"

In November 2015, a web comic called “The Oatmeal” rekindled the legendary account of how Gene Roddenberry survived on a plane crash on June 18, 1947, when an engine on a Pan Am flight from Calcutta to New York caught fire. In a series of animated story boards, the comic strip recounts how Roddenberry, a member of the flight crew, helped calm passengers before the plane crashed into the Syrian dessert.

The first party went in one direction, the second party, along with the co-pilot, went in the other, wandering into the dessert. The eventually found a village. A village which had a radio. That account of Gene Roddenberry surviving a plan crash checks out. Gene Roddenberry flew B- 17 bombers for the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his service. Then, after the war, he joined Pan American World Airways and survived the plane crash on June 18, 1947, according to Gene Roddenberry’s official biography : At war’s end, he joined Pan American World Airways. It was on a flight from Calcutta that his plane lost two engines and caught fire in flight, crashing at night in the Syrian desert. As the senior surviving officer, Roddenberry sent two Englishmen swimming across the Euphrates River in quest of the source of a light he had observed just prior to the crash impact. The Englishmen reached a Syrian military outpost, which sent a small plane to investigate. Roddenberry returned with the small plane to the outpost, where he broadcast a message that was relayed to Pan Am, which sent a stretcher plane to the rescue. Roddenberry later received a Civil Aeronautics commendation for his efforts during and after the crash. After Gene Roddenberry left aviation to pursue a career in television, he had a stop-off as a Los Angeles police officer before he found success. Then, in 1966, Roddenberry created and produced Star Trek, which went on to develop one of the most loyal fan bases in the history of television. So, accounts of a young Gene Roddenberry surviving a plan crash before going on to create and produce Star Trek are true. ","Celebrities"
"Steve Jobs’ Last Words Were a Warning About the Pursuit of Wealth-Incorrectly Attributed!","2015-11-11 10:20:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/steve-jobs-last-words-were-a-warning-about-the-pursuit-of-wealth/"," Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ last words were written in an essay in which he called himself a “twisted being” who had foolishly dedicated his life to the pursuit of wealth. "," Steve Jobs’ last words were not written in a deathbed essay about wealth and happiness. The essay, which was written by an unknown author, was falsely presented as Steve Jobs’ last words as he lay dying from pancreatic cancer in 2011. An excerpt of the so-called Steve Jobs’ last words essay reads: I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer… Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth… Should be something that is more important: Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me. The author of that essay isn’t known, but it has been falsely attributed to Steve Jobs on many blog and social media sites across the Internet. But accounts of Steve Jobs’ final moments by his family members and by biographer Walter Isaacson make no mention of a deathbed essay or final words uttered by Steve Jobs about the dangers of a life devoted to pursuing wealth. Steve Jobs’ sister, the novelist Mona Simpson, recounted the Apple co-founders final moments in a eulogy that was published by the New York Times at the time of his death in October 2011. In the eulogy, Simpson recalled Steve Jobs’ final words and his final hours: He seemed to be climbing. But with that will, that work ethic, that strength, there was also sweet Steve’s capacity for wonderment, the artist’s belief in the ideal, the still more beautiful later. Steve’s final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve’s final words were: OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW. Also, a profound deathbed essay written by Steve Jobs about the life, death and the pursuit of wealth would have been highlighted in “Steve Jobs,” the definitive biography written by Walter Isaacson. No such essay is mentioned in the book. ","Celebrities"

"," The Jake from State Farm actor isn’t dead. This celebrity death hoax was started by the fake news website Huzlers. The website (falsely) reported that the actor who plays Jake from State Farm was found dead in his apartment, apparently murdered by his wife for infidelity: Jake From State Farm first appeared in a television advertisement for State Farm a few years ago, and has since been the center of many internet jokes and memes. The basic name structure of Jake From State Farm has been copied for other internet memes including ‘Alex From Target’ and ‘Daquan From Staples’. Jake From State Farm was murdered by his own wife for allegedly cheating on her. Very Ironic, considering that the original Jake From State Farm commercial was about being unfaithful. According to State Farm, Jake would be a good neighbor to all of his clients, but when he needed help, nobody was there for him. Jake’s wife was arrested a few hours following the murder. “A true hero” quoted State Farm. Reports of Jake from State Farm’s death swept the Internet as the false report was shared nearly 50,000 times on social media sites. Some readers even expressed condolences in the comment section of the Huzlers website. But Huzlers is known for publishing fake news stories that often trick readers into believing they’re real. The website’s terms and conditions page says that it tries to ensure the accuracy of all stories, but “We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on this Web Site.” There were also (false) reports that another actor from the Jake from State Farm commercial was found dead. The fake news website Empire News reported that Justin Campbell, the actor who played a husband whose suspicious wife walked in on him having a late-night phone call with Jake from State Farm, was murdered in his Los Angeles home by his jealous wife. Again, Empire News isn’t a trustworthy website.

"," The rumor that Steve from Blues Clues died in a car accident is a celebrity death hoax. The fake news website MSMBC News started the rumor that Steve from Blues Clues died in a car accident at the age of 42. The website (falsely) reported that Steve Burns was killed in a one-vehicle car cash that happened in Pennsylvania: Burns was pronounced dead at 7:11 p.m. Friday at The Reading Hospital and Medical Center in Reading, Berks County Coroner Randall Wiseman told The Associated Press. Burns, best known as the original host of the long-running children’s television program Blue’s Clues, suffered severe head trauma and internal injuries after he wrecked a 2014 Dodge Challenger near the community of Shillington. Pennsylvania Highway Patrol responded to the crash after receiving a 911 call of a vehicle that had overturned on the roadway. Burns was traveling north, toward Reading along Route 422, when the wreck occurred, Wiseman confirmed. The caller, who was traveling behind Burns at the time of the accident, indicated to the 911 operator that he had seen deer on the roadway just before the accident occurred, which police believe may have been a major factor. Many fans of the popular children’s show Blue Clues shared the false report of Steve Burns’s death on social media sites. The story had been shared nearly 50,000 times on social media sites within days of publication. MSMBC News publishes a combination of real and fake news stories, which makes false reports like the one about Steve from Blues Clues dying hard to pinpoint. The site has started other celebrity death hoaxes about Willie Nelson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, just to name a few. Steve Burns took to Twitter to settle rumors of demise: Steve from Blues Clues became a household name after the children’s show first aired on Nickelodeon in 1996. Steve walked away from Blues Clues at the peak of the show’s popularity, which has sparked plenty of rumors of his demise over the years. The earliest rumors about Steve from “Blues Clues” being killed in a car crash date all the way back to the late 1990s, the Cincinnati Inquirer reports : He walked in the door, and the rumor flew out the window. Steve Burns, host of Nickelodeon’s hugely popular Blue’s Clues , was not dead. Indeed, he was standing right there in the Ritz-Carlton ballroom. According to rumors on the Internet, Steve Burns had been killed in a car wreck or overdosed on drugs. Where did the rumors come from? “We have no idea,” says Mr. Burns. The 25-year-old actor had come to Pasadena last month to accept a children’s TV award from the Television Critics Association. He wore a brown sports coat and a print shirt, not his trademark green striped rugby shirt. After Steve left Blues Clues he acted in a Dunkin’ Donuts commercial and made an appearance in the show “Homicide: Life in the Street” as a man who died in police custody. After that, Steve said that he couldn’t return to on-camera children’s television because he had “confused his audience” by taking on adult-themed roles. Steve did work behind the scenes on a few Blues Clues side project as an executive producer, however. So, this isn’t the first celebrity death hoax about Steve from Blues Clues, and it probably won’t be the last. ","Celebrities"

Fox has been arrested for insider sports betting. "," Don’t believe stories about Michael J. Fox being arrested for insider sports betting. The rumor started out as a joke about Back to the Future II, but lots of people missed the punch line. In the movie, Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) travels to the future — October 21, 2015, to be exact — to prevent his nemesis, Biff Tennan, from making millions on insider sports betting. Tennan had somehow got his hands on “a sports almanac from the future” and used it to place insider sports bets during the eighties. Because Marty McFly time traveled to October 21, 2015, in the movie, the date was celebrated (in real life) as “Back to the Future Day.” The false report about Michael J. Fox being arrested for sport betting, a parody of the movie’s plot, was part of that. The fake news website Stubhill News played a big role in the rumor going viral. The site reported that Michael J. Fox had been arrested for inside betting on the DraftKings daily fantasy sports website: Los Angeles—Michael J. Fox was arrested Wednesday morning in relation to insider sports betting on DraftKings. Fox aroused suspicion after achieving a statistically-impossible, perfect record on the site under the username NoChicken. Authorities found an unusually worn copy of a sports almanac which was just recently printed and which has markings cataloging winning bets Fox has placed since the late 80’s. “The operating theory is that the Back to the Future films were really documentaries from an original, prime timeline,” said NASA astrophysicist Barry Manilow. “The implications are heavy. It is suspected that we are living in an alternate 2015, as there are no flying cars and there are only four Jaws movies. We can only assume that we are forever stunted as a society. The amount of lives lost due to our lack of progress in technology and medicine is unfathomable. Worst of all, instead of hoverboards, this sad reality is limited to the Swagway.” But rest assured, Michael J. Fox has not been arrested for insider sports betting. ","Celebrities"

A palomino horse named Bamboo Harvester played Mister Ed throughout the entire show’s run from 1958 to 1966, IMBD reports : Mister Ed, a Palomino horse officially named Bamboo Harvester, was a show and parade horse who was foaled in 1949 in El Monte, California.

Rumors that Mister Ed was a zebra have been around for years, but it’s not clear exactly where they started.

"Sylvester Stallone Was Homeless and Sold His Dog to Make Rocky-Mostly Truth!","2015-07-23 07:33:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sylvester-stallone-was-homeless-and-sold-his-dog-to-make-rocky/"," Sylvester Stallone sold his dog as a broke aspiring actor and later bought the dog back for $15,000. "," It’s true that Sylvester Stallone sold his dog before starring in “Rocky,” but some parts of the young actor’s story have been sensationalized over the years. The rumor started with a story that first appeared on the website Endless Human Potential in 2009. The tale was later posted on Facebook , and Stallone’s rags-to-riches legend was born. The story goes that Stallone sold his dog outside a liquor store for $50 in the early 1970s because he was broke and nearly homeless. Then, once the actor managed to write and sell the script for “Rocky,” he bought the dog back for $15,000 so it could star in the upcoming movie. The basic facts of the story are true. Stallone and his wife moved from New York to Hollywood with his bullmastiff, Butkus, in the mid 1970s, Stallone said in an interview : “On our way from New York to Hollywood to seek our fortune, the heat became so intense that we had to pack old Butkus in cracked ice for two days. I promised him that if we survived, he’d someday get treated like a king. But I almost changed my mind when he practically got us killed in a wildlife preserve. An exceptionally large ostrich decided to peck him to death and attacked the car. Rather than being diplomatic, Butkus jumped out in a counter attack and I practically got slaughtered trying to separate them. By the time I got him back in the old car for a quick escape, the thing stalled and a herd of unhappy buffalo descended and attempted to upset the car with us in it. In the middle of all that confusion, Butkus jumped in the back seat and went to sleep.” Then, six months before Stallone hit it big with “Rocky,” he sold his dog to a family to help make ends meet. Stallone eventually talked the family into giving Butkus back so that he could star in the movie, the actor explains: “The other family had owned him for six months,” Stallone says.  “They weren’t exactly thrilled, but I said, ‘Please.’ I said, ‘This dog belongs in the movie.’ He had suffered along with me for two years. I said, ‘Please let him have a shot in the movie.’” Mercifully, the family relented and Stallone’s dog starred in two “Rocky” films. He even appears in the credits as Butkus Stallone. So, it’s true that Stallone sold his dog before his big break. But Stallone didn’t sell his dog to an unknown man outside a liquor store, and there’s no proof that he paid 15,000 to get Butkus back, as the eRumor claims. It’s not uncommon for the line between truth and fiction to blur for dramatic effect in the retelling of rags-to-riches stories like this one. Another example is the legend of Stallone writing and selling “Rocky,” which is also repeated in this eRumor. It’s been widely reported that a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner inspired Stallone to write the original script for “Rocky” in less than a day. Much of that is true, but again, parts of it have been fictionalized. In a 1976 interview with a New York Times reporter, Stallone said it took him 10 months to write the script after watching the Ali-Wepner fight: ”I was watching the fight in a movie theater,” he said, ”and I said to myself, ‘Let’s talk about stifled ambition and broken dreams and people who sit on the curb looking at their dreams go down the drain.’ I thought about it for a month. That’s what I call my inspiration stage. Then I let it incubate for 10 months, the incubation stage. Then came the verification stage, when I wrote it in 3 1/2 days. I’d get up at 6 A.M. and write it by hand, with a Bic pen on lined notebook sheets of paper. Then my wife, Sasha, would type it. She kept saying, ‘You’ve gotta do it, you’ve gotta do it. Push it, Sly, go for broke.”’ So, the key points of this eRumor are true. But details have been added to Stallone’s “rags-to-riches story” over the years for dramatic effect. ","Celebrities"

As the music started, Cyrus began to sing while squatting over the burning Bible and performing a sexually provocative dance with repetitive thrusting hip movements, called ‘twerking.’ A few moments later the stage went dark, lit up only by two large red inverted crosses, usually associated with satanic worship. Cyrus began to dance around a large phallic object, using it as a stripper pole, while removing parts of her clothing.

The explosive new information is contained in a Springdale, Ark., police report obtained by In Touch magazine.

I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life. I sought forgiveness from those I had wronged and asked Christ to forgive me and come into my life. I would do anything to go back to those teen years and take different actions. In my life today, I am so very thankful for God’s grace, mercy and redemption.” Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar also commented on the allegations: “Back 12 years ago our family went through one of the most difficult times of our lives. When Josh was a young teenager, he made some very bad mistakes and we were shocked. We had tried to teach him right from wrong. That dark and difficult time caused us to seek God like never before. Even though we would never choose to go through something so terrible, each one of our family members drew closer to God. We pray that as people watch our lives they see that we are not a perfect family. We have challenges and struggles everyday. It is one of the reasons we treasure our faith so much because God’s kindness and goodness and forgiveness are extended to us — even though we are so undeserving. We hope somehow the story of our journey — the good times and the difficult times — cause you to see the kindness of God and learn that He can bring you through anything.” ","Celebrities"

"," Paul McCartney didn’t die in 1966. The “Paul is Dead” urban legend gained steam in the 1960s, and it’s still very much alive today. A track on the Beatles’ White Album , “I’m So Tired,” was the first time that the urban legend gained widespread attention. When played backwards, inaudible words toward the end of the song clearly say, “Paul is dead.” Listeners then uncovered even more hidden references about Paul McCartney’s death in other songs and album artwork, and a full-blown urban legend was born. Years later, in 2004, Paul McCartney explained how the idea to plant rumors about his death came about in an interview with Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer. Turns out, by 1966 Beatles manager Brian Epstein was unhappy with the new direction the band’s song writing had taken. Epstein hatched a plan to drive album sales in the event that fans felt the same way, McCartney told Spitzer: “When I told (Brian Epstein) our future albums would be dominated by songs about interesting people and places, his heart sank. He didn’t think people would buy such albums and came up with this great idea to push sales in the event he was right and we were wrong. The idea was that we would plant clues in our songs and album covers that one of us had died in a car wreck. If after a few albums, our records weren’t selling well, we’d leak out word about the clues and let our fans and the press take over. People would buy the albums to see and hear the clues. We thought, ‘Wow, that’s an incredible idea!’ We realized it would be great fun to have all those clues sitting there undiscovered until people started going nuts looking for them all.” Beatles album sales never slumped, but the “Paul is Dead” urban legend took on a life of its own. Brian Epstein originally selected Ringo Starr to “die” because he was the most popular Beatle in the U.S. market at the time. After Starr turned it down, however, Paul McCartney was chosen, presumably because he was the second most popular Beatle in the U.S. Over the decades, the “Paul is Dead” urban legend has gained new life at times. A film titled “Paul McCartney Really is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison” gave the urban legend new life in 2010. The showed supposed footage of Harrison talking about how Paul McCartney had died in a car accident in 1966 and was secretly replaced by a lookalike. However, the filmmakers patched previous recordings together with a voice that was “identical to Harrison’s” to make the so-called confession seem real, Music Radar reports .

"Couple Sells Princess Diana Beanie Baby for $93,000 – Fiction!","2015-04-28 20:06:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/couple-sells-princess-diana-beanie-baby-for-93000/"," A young couple purchased a Princess Diana Beanie Baby for $15 at a flea market in England and sold the rare stuffed animal for $93,000 on eBay. "," Reports that a young couple sold a Princess Diana Beanie Baby on eBay for $93,000 are false. The claim went viral after media outlets in England like the Daily Mail and The Independent reported that Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan had found the rare stuffed bear at a flea market for about $15, and that they hoped to sell it on eBay for $93,000. According to Daily Mail: “As a former collector, Mr Flanaghan, 22, recognised the bear as a limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby — one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds. “But the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world — and that another version is currently listed on eBay for £62,500. “The pair is now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house.” It’s important to note that the Daily Mail article said that the couple was hoping to sell the Princess Di Beanie Baby for £62,500 (about $93,000). That’s quite a bit different than actually selling the Princess Di Beanie Baby for $93,000. However, that important detail was lost in translation when many people read the article. The article shows a screenshot of the Princess Di Beanie Baby auction at $93,000 on eBay, but that’s deceiving. It’s easy for eBay users to bid on their own items using a different account to drive up the price, and that appears to be what’s happened here. The Princess Di Beanie Baby has been at the center of controversy before. Problems are so bad that the website Ty Collector (Ty is the company that made billions selling Beanie Babies in the 1990s) has singled out the Princess Di Beanie Baby with a collector’s fraud alert : “From time to time, prices paid by buyers on eBay for the Princess Beanie Baby increase dramatically for a short period of time. This generally happens when a blogger, a personality on a TV show or a news reporter claims Princess is valuable because it is selling for an extremely high price on eBay. “That of course, is an uninformed misrepresentation or sometimes an intentional deception designed to scam potential collectors who do not understand how eBay really works.” “…When we see spikes in the value of Princess Beanie Babies due to events like this, we do not use the outrageously high prices paid for Princess at eBay in our value computations for at least a 60-day period. By then the secondary market has settled sufficiently to resume using all of the prices paid at eBay in our value formulas. During these temporary periods of artificial value hype we focus more on the prices being received by known “honest” collectors and dealers. “The same thing happened in 2013 when an uninformed ‘appraiser’ on a popular television show suggested a Princess Beanie found in an abandoned storage room could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on which version of Princess it happened to be. That incorrect assessment was also based on whatPrincess was being ‘listed’ for on eBay instead of the true indicator; the prices buyers actually ‘PAY’ for Princess on eBay. “Buyers beware. We would gladly and immediately notify collectors if something transpired that would cause a dramatic increase in the value of a Princess Beanie Baby. It would of course have to be something like a P.V.C.-eating virus that is destroying all of the Princess Beanies in the world that were not protected in sealed plastic containers; but short of something remarkable like that, it isn’t likely the true value of the Princess Beanie Baby will be skyrocketing any time soon — or in our lifetimes for that matter.” So, what’s the big deal about the Princess Di Beanie Baby? The Beanie Baby, a purple bear with a white rose sewn on its chest, was sold after Princess Diana’s death in 1997 to raise money for the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. A tag that comes with the Princess Di Beanie Baby includes a poem that calls the fallen princess an “angel.” Confusion about the Princess Di Beanie Baby started almost immediately after it was released in 1997, Ty Collector reports : “Ty introduced Princess on October 29, 1997. In November 1997, Ty informed U.S. retailers they could only order 12 Princess Beanie Babies for delivery in December. This restriction caused many collectors and retailers to believe Princess would be a limited edition. The ‘limited edition’ rumors caused a buying frenzy when Princess first shipped in December 1997. “Collector and speculator demand immediately drove the secondary market price for a Princess Beanie Baby to well over $200. When a different version of the Princess tush tag appeared, speculation about the variations caused even more confusion about Princess. “Much of the ’true’ production history for the Princess Beanie Baby is still a mystery. New collectors are misled into believing Princess is valuable by uninformed, dishonest or deluded sellers on eBay who frequently attempt to sell or auction Princess for prices ranging from hundreds to millions of dollars.” Claims that Princess Di Beanie Babies are worth millions of dollars (or even hundreds of dollars) are totally false. Ty Collector reports that “first edition” Princess Di Beanie Babies that were made in China are worth about $27, and “first edition” Princess Di Beanie Babies that were made in Indonesia are worth about $47. Long story short, no Beanie Baby is worth $93,000. ","Celebrities"

"Ex-CIA Operative Normand Hodges Admits to Marilyn Monroe’s Assassination-Fiction!","2015-04-23 15:16:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ex-cia-operative-normand-hodges-admits-to-marilyn-monroes-assassination/"," A retired CIA operative named Normand Hodges confessed to Marilyn Monroe’s assassination on his deathbed. "," A fake news website is behind this false report. A story that appeared on the fake news website World News Daily Report claimed that retired CIA operative Normand Hodges confessed to the assassination of Marilyn Monroe on his deathbed. Normand Hodges recalled Marilyn Monroe’s “assassination” in the article: “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy, but also with Fidel Castro. My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die, and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!” The false report was shared thousands of times on social media and many readers believed that it was real. However, according to World News Daily Report’s disclaimer , the website assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” If the website’s disclaimer wasn’t enough to prove this claim false, the story includes photos of an elderly man identified as Normand Hodges that can easily be proven false. The man in the photos is Michael Tyrell, a terminally ill prisoner who was serving a 20-year prison sentence for drug offenses, the Guardian reports . Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her bedroom on August 5, 1962. The coroner ruled that her death was a probable suicide by barbiturates, according to the autopsy report : “Miss Monroe has suffered from psychiatric disturbance for a long time. On more than one occasion … when disappointed or depressed, she has made a suicide attempt. On these occasions, she had been rescued. It is our opinion the same pattern was repeated except for the rescue.” Many conspiracy theories have persisted over the years about Marilyn Monroe’s death. Some speculate that the FBI assassinated her, and others speculate that Bobby Kennedy ordered her assassination. At this point, however, those are nothing more than conspiracy theories.

"Louis Armstrong Was Taken in By a Jewish Family as a Boy-Truth!","2015-04-09 18:36:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/louis-armstrong-was-taken-in-by-a-jewish-family-as-a-boy/"," An email claims that legendary musician Louis Armstrong was taken in by a Jewish family from Lithuania that encouraged him to play music and bought his first instrument. "," Most of these claims about Louis Armstrong’s childhood are true. Ken Burns dug up most of the details for his documentary, “ Jazz ,” and they have often been repeated since in aired in 2001. Louis Armstrong’s parents separated shortly after his birth, and neither played a big role in his life. He lived with his grandmother and dropped out of school in the fifth grade to work, according to his biography, “ Louis Armstrong: An Extravagant Life .” The Karnofskys, a family of Jewish immigrants, hired Louis Armstrong as a delivery boy, but they soon took him under their wing, according to an account by Stanley Karnow, a distant relative of the Karnofskys: “They took him under their wing, fed him a hot meal every evening, lent him five dollars to buy his first cornet. And because they were Jewish, as a gesture of gratitude for their generosity Armstrong wore a Star of David around his neck for the rest of his life. Thus they inadvertently contributed to American culture — and earned at least a measure of immortality.” Still, there’s no record that the Karnofskys ever adopted Louis Armstrong as their child, as the eRumor claims. Stanley Karnow said that his family felt “somehow related” to Armstrong, but that doesn’t mean they adopted him. And it’s not clear exactly how much time Louis Armstrong spent with the family, either. He was sent to a home for boys after he got in trouble for shooting a gun in the air on New Years Eve 1912, according to Biography.com : “There, he received musical instruction on the cornet and fell in love with music. In 1914, the home released him, and he immediately began dreaming of a life making music. While he still had to work odd jobs selling newspapers and hauling coal to the city’s famed red-light district, Armstrong began earning a reputation as a fine blues player. One of the greatest cornet players in town, Joe ‘King’ Oliver, began acting as a mentor to the young Armstrong, showing him pointers on the horn and occasionally using him as a sub.” Most of the claims made in this email are true, but a few details may be slightly off the mark.

"The unhappy lives of the cast of the “Our Gang” comedies-Truth!& Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ourgang/"," The eRumor lists some of the cast members of the famous Our Gang comedies and their troubled lives saying that Robert Blake, who the eRumor says played Spanky, has added to the list by being accused of killing his wife. "," Most of these are true although Robert Blake did not play Spanky in the series of films that were both known as Our Gang and The Little Rascals between 1929 and 1938 . Whether these add up to a “curse” is up to the observer, but various stories about the Our Gang cast have circulated for years. Let’s take them one at a time from the eRumor: Alfalfa — Carl Switzer was shot to death at age 31- Truth! According to OUR GANG – LIFE AND TIMES OF THE LITTLE RASCALS by MALTIN AND BANN, Switzer was wounded in Jan 1958 when someone shot him as he was getting into a car. Then the next year, a fatal shot was delivered in a struggle over $50 with an ex-partner in a big game hunting business. Chubby — 300-pound Norman Chaney died at age 22 following an operation- Truth! His death was actually at 18, not 22 and it followed surgery for a glandular condition. Buckwheat — William Thomas died at age 49 of a heart attack- Truth! . He died in Los Angeles in 1980 after a successful life as a film lab technician in Hollywood. Darla Hood — The Our Gang leading lady contracted hepatitis and died at age 47- Truth! She died on June 13, 1979. Brisbane — Kendall McCormas, known as Breezy Brisbane, committed suicide at age 64.- Truth! The correct spelling of his name is McComas. According to published reports, he gave up show business to be an electrical engineer at the U.S. Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California. He committed suicide two weeks before his retirement in 1981. Froggy — William Robert Laughline was killed in a motor scooter accident at age 16.- Truth! Laughline was killed in a motor scooter accident near Huntington Beach, CA in the early 1950’s Mickey Daniels — He died of liver disease at 55- Truth! His real name was Richard Daniels, Jr. He died alone in a hotel of cirrhosis of the liver on August 20, 1970. Stymie — Mathew Bear led a life of crime and drugs. He died of a stroke at age 56- Truth! & Fiction! After leaving the Our Gang series as a child, Stymie reportedly acted through high school. He became addicted to drugs, especially heroin and spent much of his young adult years in an out of jail. In the 1980 ‘s got clean of drugs and both went back into acting and traveling doing drug abuse lectures. He died of Pneumonia. Scotty Beckett — He died at age 38 following a brutal beating- Unconfirmed! According to Maltin and Bann’s book, “The last 10 years of his life were filled with unpleasant stories of divorce, violence, drugs and arrests.” He checked into a Hollywood nursing home on May 8, 1968, needing medical attention after suffering a serious beating. He died two days later. Although pills and a note were found, no conclusion was made by the coroner as to the exact cause of death. According to the Internet Movie Database, he died of an overdose of barbiturates. Wheezer — Robert Hutchins was killed in an airplane accident at age 19- Truth! According to findagrave.com, he was killed during the last thirty minutes of his basic training at the Merced Army Air Corps field in California when his plane crashed on landing. Pete the Pup — He was poisoned by an unknown assailant- Unproven! There were actually several different dogs used through the years as Pete the Pup, the canine star of films. There are several reports that the original Pete the Pup was poisoned by someone who gave him meat laced with glass. There is also an urban legend that Pete the Pup was buried with Alfalfa but we’ve found no evidence of that and Pete the Pup died long before Alfalfa. Alfalfa loved hunting and apparently there is a dog on his tombstone that reflects that so that may have been a part of what prompted the urban legend about Pete the Pup. A nd Spanky. . .Robert Blake – is accused of murdering his wife – Fiction! First, Robert Blake did not play Spanky in the Our Gang series. Spanky was played by George McFarland who went on to become a Forth Worth, Texas businessman before his death of a heart attack in 1993. Robert Blake was found innocent by a jury of the charges of killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.  He was later found liable for her wrongful death by a California civil court. Blake did appear in some of the later Little Rascals episodes and played Mickey. According to crime writer David Lohr, there are some additions to the Our Gang death list: Robert H. Young “Bonedust” (9/15/17 – 9/10/51) Died in a hotel fire, which started when he fell asleep smoking in bed. Harold Switzer “Deadpan” or “Slim” – (1/16/25 – 4/14/67) As was the case with his brother, Harold was also killed following a dispute with another man. Darwood Kaye “Waldo” – (9/08/29 – 5/15/2002) Killed by a hit and run driver while walking on the sidewalk. Jay R. Smith “Jay R” – (8/29/15 – 10/05/2002) Stabbed to death and left in the desert by a homeless man he had befriended .

"Actor Andy Kaufman returns from the dead?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kaufman/"," Stories and emails are circulating on the Internet that claim that actor Andy Kaufman, who died in 1984 of lung cancer, is alive. They refer to a website at andykaufmanreturns.blogspot.com that has allegedly been set up by Kaufman to announce his return. "," There is no evidence that       Andy Kaufman is alive. Rumors to the contrary are based on the appearance of a website, a       fund-raising event by one of his friends, and a news release…all       on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of his death. Andy Kaufman was the quirky actor who played Latka       Gravas on the sitcom “Taxi.” He was portrayed by Jim Carrey in the film Man on the Moon. Kaufman was known for outlandish antics and faking his own death       is something that he once mentioned. Long time friend and fellow pranskster Bob Zmuda told the LA       Weekly that Kaufman first talked about the idea back in       1980. “Andy said, ‘You know if some celebrity really did this, do you       know big it would be? How legendary it would be?” He mused about reappearing 20 years later. Zmuda has a non-profit organization called COMIC RELIEF that       sponsored a “welcome back” party on May 16, 2004, the 20th       anniversary of Kaufman’s death at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. It was a $250 per plate fund-raiser. Everybody who participated in it did so as a tribute to Kaufman and       to raise funds for COMIC RELIEF. There was a twinkle in each person’s eye and no serious expectation       for him to appear. Then the website appeared. It claims to be set up by Kaufman and anticipating his making an       appearance. It originally predicted he would appear on the 16th and said that       DNA tests had been done on Kaufman to prove he was alive, results       that were certified by the Ernst &       Young accounting firm. A press release announcing the website also said he’d been       interviewed by ABC. A subsequent statement on the website, however, backpedals about the       Ernst & Young involvement as well as the ABC interview. Kaufman died in Los Angeles but is buried in Beth David Cemetery, in       Elmont, New York. His funeral was on May 18th, 1984 in Great Neck, New York. Ever mindful that Kaufman was a prankster, several guests who       attended the open-casket service said they nudged or poked the body       just to make sure he was not faking it.

"Hidden code in Microsoft Windows says Bill Gates is the Anti-Christ-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/billgates-hm/"," This email talks suspiciously about the success of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.  It also says that the ASCII code numbers for his name add up to “666,” a significant number in the book of Revelation in the Bible related to a leader that will rise to power at the close of human history.  It also talks about a sinister-looking and hidden program in Windows that, the writer claims, can be used by Bill Gates to control the world. "," This email is a hoax. 1.  It talks about the fact that the name, “Bill Gates III” adds up to “666” in ASCII code.  Let’s start there.  (This may get a little complex).  Every letter, number, and symbol on a computer has a corresponding numerical ASCII code.  It’s not only the way a computer communicates behind the scenes, but a standardized way that computers can speak the same language to each another.  Also, each letter or number on the keyboard has two different versions of the ASCII code, one called a decimal code and one called a hexadecimal equivalent.  For a capital “A”, for example, the ASCII decimal is 65 and the hexadecimal equivalent is 41.  In the email, all the ASCII codes for “Bill Gates” are correct if you use the decimal ASCII codes for capital letters.  When it comes to “III”, however, nothing adds up.  The email claims that the ASCII code for each of characters in “III” is 1, but that is not the case.  If you use lower case “L” for the “III”, the decimal ASCII code is 108.  If you use upper case “i”, the decimal code is 73.  If you use the number “1”, the decimal code is 49.  There isn’t any instance in the ASCII code in which any of the visible letters or numerals that would be used for “III” has a decimal or hexadecimal number that equates to “1.” 2.  The writer of the email tries to emphasize the point by saying that if you go to Windows 95 or MS-DOS, you’ll get the same result.  That’s meaningless because the ASCII code is a standardized one and is the same on each computer that uses it.  There is not one ASCII code for Windows 95, then another for Windows 98, then another for the various version of MS-DOS. 3.  Regarding THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS, there is nothing sinister about it and it has nothing to do with Bill Gates or Microsoft controlling any other computers, much more the U.S. nuclear arsenal.  The HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is what’s known among computer buffs as an “Easter Egg.”  Software programmers routinely include fun stuff in their programs that is hidden from normal view.  That’s why they’re called “Easter Eggs,” because they are hidden and you have to find them.  One website that catalogs Easter Eggs has accumulated a list of nearly four thousand of them in thousands of different software programs.  Some of them are humorous pictures.  Others are clever games.  Many Easter Eggs display a list of all of the names of programmers who created the program.  THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS is a game of sorts that the programmers included in Microsoft Excel 95.  It results in your finding a list of the creators as well as some pictures.

"William Shatner to Perform in Upcoming Star Wars Sequel-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/william-shatner-star-wars/"," Star Trek actor, William Shatner, posted a press clipping on his Facebook profile on March 31, 2013 that said Disney has announced him to play a role of the upcoming Star Wars sequel. "," This was an April Fools Joke. Actor William Shatner has been “wooing” Bad Robot director J.J. Abrams for parts in his upcoming projects, according to a February 22, 2013 article in Huffington Post , but we have found no evidence of this being true. The release posted on Shatner’s Facebook fan page contained a Fox News link, which did not work and a search of the Fox News and other news sites found no such story. Shatner later posted on his Facebook fan page that George Takei “announced today that he, too will be in Episode VII! Bad enough I had to put up with that Fisher woman and now Him? You know how HE is…always demanding the best lines and hogging all the camera time! No thank you JJ, I’ll stick to Star Trek! ;-)” Finally, shortly after 10:30PM on the evening of April 1, the actor confessed to the prank on his profile page saying, “With the end of April 1st drawing near the end of this Star Wars charade must also come to a close. May the Farce Be With You! 😉 MBB”   “MBB” is Shatner’s sign off on Twitter and stands for “My Best Bill.” J.J. Abrams has directed two new Star Trek films, Start Trek (2009) and Star Trek: Into Darkness, which is slated to be released in May 2013.   Recently Abrams was announced to direct the new Star Wars films by Disney and Shatner jokingly told reporters at Movie Fanatic that Abrams was a pig for hogging both franchises. Since the 1970’s Sci Fi fans have continuously argued which series is better, Star Wars or Star Trek and this sort of news may be quite a stunner to fans of both series. Canadian born Shatner, 82, has played the role of James T. Kirk, Captain of the USS Enterprise from 1966 to 1994 on television and the big screen.  The popular 1960’s science fiction series was created by Gene Roddenberry who conceptualized the series as “Wagon Train to the Stars.” Throughout Shatner’s career he has had a history of being a bit of a practical jokester. Shatner wrote about some of his pranks during his Star Trek days in his Star Trek Memories autobiography and included a story a famous payback where he once flew all the way to Hawaii sitting next to a very tall alien dummy prop that his fellow cast members had secretly arranged to be his travelling companion.  The prank took place during the very early days of Star Trek, before it was a TV sensation and Captain Kirk was recognized by the public. Star Trek alien dummy that flew to Hawaii with William Shatner In 2004 the Shatner hosted a reality TV series, Invasion Iowa , where he had the population of Riverside, Iowa tricked into believing that he was directing a science fiction movie in their home town.   After the joke was revealed to the community, Shatner presented the town with some lovely gifts.   Riverside was also a location for one of the scenes in the first Star Trek film that Abrams directed. The actor, who is notorious at making fun of himself, was recently featured in an online video promotion of a new Star Trek game, which reenacted a famous battle with an old adversaries, the Gorn.

"," This eRumor is false because Jay Leno’s replacement, Jimmy Fallon, has historically been a more consistent critic of the president and congressional Democrats than Leno was. Democrats were the butt of 713 jokes made by late-night talk show hosts in the first half of 2013, and nearly 300 of those jokes targeted Obama, according to an August 2013 study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs. “Jimmy Fallon was the toughest on Democrats, with over three times as many jokes about Democrats (240) as Republicans (76),” the study concluded. It would defy logic for the White House to advocate for a personnel move that brought a more consistent critic of the president and the Democratic agenda to the “Tonight Show.” An NBC executive said the 62-year-old Leno was replaced by the 38-year-old Fallon to attract younger viewers, according to a Washington Post article .

"Actress Jane Fonda has become a born-again Christian-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/janefonda/"," Jane Fonda is said to have “accepted Christ as her personal Savior” and is being helped in her new faith by Christians in the Atlanta area. "," According to those who were close to Jane Fonda when she first made the decision to declare her Christianity 1n 1998, she was enthusiastic about her decision to become a Christian and was deeply affected by the Christians who were in her life at that time. According to published articles, she was attending the Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, an African-American church. Fonda confirmed her Christian commitment and that she was attending the church in an interview in Oprah Winfrey’s O magazine in 2000. She had said very little about her faith until 2005 when she published her book, “My Life So Far.” In the book she said that when she turned 60 and began to deal with an eating disorder in her life, she also felt that something was missing and turned to Christianity. She had not told her husband Ted Turner about becoming a Christian but when he learned of it, she says it was one of the factors that broke up their marriage. She said that she knows it was not fair to keep the news of her faith from him, but that she was “…yearning for the spiritual that I had not had.  And I knew that if I told him or asked him before I did it, that he would talk me out of it.” Turner is from a Christian background and even once considered becoming a missionary, but has been critical of Christianity and once called it “a religion for losers” but later apologized. In her book, Fonda talks openly and passionately about her Christianity and how much it has meant to her but that like her life, her faith is still progressing. When she made the decision to become a Christian it was within the context of Evangelical Christian friendships but in the book she avoids describing that event in detail. She said she regards herself as a “feminist Christian” and is trying to reconcile that what she calls the “patriarchal, hierarchal structure” of Christianity. Last updated 4/11/05 ","Celebrities"
"Jane Fonda’s supported the enemy in Vietnam got American POW’skilled-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hanoijane/"," In protest of Jane Fonda being considered as one of the top 100 women of the century, this email reminds Americans of her controversial visit to North Vietnam during the war. It quotes a POW named Jerry Driscoll who was taken from his prison cell, cleaned and dressed for a visit with Fonda, then ordered to give Fonda a positive account of his treatment. He spit at Fonda and was beaten and dragged away.  Then a group of POWs which included a Col. Larry Carrigan were brought out to visit with Fonda.  According to the story, “…she walked the line, shaking each man’s hand and asking little encouraging snippets like: “Aren’t you sorry you bombed babies?” & “Are you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors?”  Many of the POW’s were listed as missing in action so to identify themselves to American authorities, they each wrote their Social Security numbers on small pieces of paper and slipped them to Fonda as she greeted them.  To their horror, however, after Fonda finished meeting them, she turned to the North Vietnamese commanding officer and handed him the POW’s pieces of paper.  In the beatings that followed, three American POW’s died and Col. Carrigan nearly died.  The email then ends with a statement about events in North Vietnam from an unnamed American POW. "," February 16, 2013 Update: This rumor has once again gone viral with the news of a film where actress Jane Fonda will be portraying the role of Nancy Reagan.    The film is called The Butler and is about a man who served as a butler under 8 U.S. Presidents in the White House.  At this time it is still in the post production stage and no release date has been issued. October 7, 2010 Update: A version of this eRumor have begun circulating in 2010 saying that President Obama is honoring Jane Fonda.  This version has been circulating since 2009 and is pretty much a carbon copy of the original Barbara Walters eRumor. This story hearkens to a real visit to North Vietnam by Jane Fonda in July of 1972, but     the stories about betraying POWs is not true. The Fonda trip became unforgettable because it infuriated Americans, especially Americans in uniform, many of whom still regard her as a traitor.  She praised the North Vietnamese, posed for a photo at a Communist anti-aircraft gun emplacement, made several radio broadcasts for the Communist North Vietnamese in which she called American military leaders “war criminals,” then when some of the POWs returned home and described mistreatment by the North Vietnamese, she said Americans should “…not hail the POWs as heroes, because they are hypocrites and liars.” There is no dispute that her visit took place and that her words and actions were in support of the enemy.  This particular email includes three stories, two of which have been denied by the POWs who are named, and one of which has been confirmed as true by the source, although he was not named in the email. First, the “100 Women of the Century” was a project of the Ladies Home Journal and a TV special hosted by Barbara Walters that aired April 30, 1999.  Jane Fonda was one of the 100. How the email story about the POWs got started is not known, but it has been widely circulated. TruthOrFiction.com located Jerry Driscoll who said that the accounts about him in the email are “…the product of a very vivid imagination” and he requests that people please stop passing it on to others. TruthOrFiction.com also contacted Mike McGrath, of Nam-POWs, who says the Larry Carrigan events never happened either.  He says Carrigan calls the story a “hoax” and does not want to be associated with it.  McGrath also says that some versions of the email include an account from a Dave Hoffman and that his story is true.  Hoffman says he was tortured (hung by a broken arm) until he agreed to go before Jane Fonda.  He was among a small group who witnessed one of her radio broadcasts for Hanoi.  The part of the email that begins with “To Whom it may concern” is true.  It’s a quote from an article titled SHAME ON JANE originally published on the Advocacy And Intelligence Index website on April 28, 1999 and written by Michael Benge who was a civilian captured by the North Vietnamese in 1968.  In his statement, he also makes reference to a missionary nurse who died in captivity.  For your interest, that was Betty Olsen, a Christian Missionary Alliance nurse from New York. In 1988 in an interview with Barbara Walters on 20/20, Jane Fonda talked about her Vietnam visit and issued what some feel was an apology but which her critics say was not enough. Fonda said, “I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of the things that I said or did.  I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I’m…very sorry that I hurt them.  And I want to apologize to them and their families.” In 2005, Fonda published her autobiography in which she described in     detail her decision to go to North Vietnam. She said it was primarily motivated by her desire to document the U.S.     bombing of important dikes that, if destroyed, could kill tens of     thousands of people and devastate the lives of millions.  The U.S. had denied the bombings.     In the book, Fonda is unapologetic about the trip or her participation     in broadcasts on radio Hanoi but regrets the pictures taken of her at     the gun emplacement.  She said it made it appear as though she was celebrating armaments     aimed at American planes, which was not how she felt and was not the     context in which the pictures were taken.  She reminds readers that the U.S. investigated her trip and found no     reason to bring any charges against her.  She also describes her longstanding support of, and interaction with, U.S.     military personnel and says her only beef was with the U.S.     government, not the troops.

"," Note: Different versions of this eRumor have been circulating the Internet, some of them in very poor taste with photos of a naked woman alleged to be the mother of President Barack Obama.  TruthOrFiction.com has removed the photos from our example of the eRumor and we will not be addressing that portion of the rumor, mainly because they are in poor taste and disrespectful to the office of the President of the United States. Below are some of the historical facts of the grandfather and mother of President Barack Obama from a variety of sources.  We have linked them to our findings and we will continue to add to this page as more is revealed to us: Stanley Armour Dunham’s Troubled Youth Stanley Armour Dunham was born in Wichita, Kansas on March 23, 1918 and was the maternal grandfather of President Barack Obama. According to “ The Riddle of Barack Obama: A Psychobiography ” by Avner Falk,  Dunham suffered a traumatic loss when his mother, Ruth Lucille Armour, committed suicide on November 25, 1926. She was 26 and suffered from depression because to strife and conflict in her marriage to Ralph Waldo Emerson Dunham, who the author called a womanizer.   At that time Stanley Dunham was 8 years old.   After the death of Ruth, Ralph “regressed emotionally and abandoned his family,” leaving Stanley and his brother, Ralph Jr., in the care of their strict Christian maternal grand parents. TruthOrFiction.Com believes that much of the allegations of this eRumor may have stemmed from Falk’s book. According to “ Dreams of my Father ,” by Barack Obama by the age of 15, his future “Gramps” was kicked out of high school “for punching the principle in the nose.”   Obama wrote that the following three years of his grandfather’s life was spent doing odd jobs, hopping rail cars a number of times, “dabbling in moonshine, cards and women.”   He eventually ended up in Wichita where he met Madelyn Lee Payne and they were secretly married on the night of her school prom on May 5, 1940.  Payne’s parent disapproved of Dunham. Military Service When Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, Stanley Dunham enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private and was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, a little over 200 miles north west of Wichita.   He was not deployed to Europe until 1943.  Madelyn remained in Wichita where she worked at a Boeing aircraft assembly plant. Stanley Dunham eventually climbed up the ranks to sergeant and his unit helped to supply the Ninth Air Force in the D-Day mission on June 6, 1944.   He was eventually deployed to England but his role in the war never saw combat. According to a June 1, 2009 article by the Associated Press , “Stanley Dunham’s military personnel file was destroyed, along with millions of others, in a 1973 fire at the Military Personnel Records center in St. Louis.” Stanley Ann Dunham Two years after their secret wedding, on November 29, 1942  they had a daughter whom they named Stanley Ann Dunham. In the “Dreams of my Father”, Obama wrote, that the name choice was “one of Gramps’ less judicious ideas — he had wanted a son.” Tired of all the ridicule and endless explanations of being named after her father Stanley Ann Dunham began introducing herself as Ann by the time she was in her teens. After the war he moved the family to California where he attended the University of California at Berkley on the G.I. Bill.  Obama wrote in his autobiography, “But the classroom couldn’t contain his ambitions, his restlessness, and so the family moved again, first back to Kansas, then through a series of small Texas towns, then finally to Seattle, where they stayed long enough for my mother to finish high school.” In 1960 the Dunham family moved to Hawaii and Stanley Ann Dunham enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, where she studied Anthropology. In 1961, at the age of 17, she met a foreign student from Kenya, Barack Obama, age 25, in a Russian language class.  According to her page on the Biography.com website, she “married him after she became pregnant. They later divorced and she cared for her son while juggling a full college course load.”    Six months after a quiet wedding, Barack Hussein Obama Jr. was in Honolulu. The marriage did not meet the approval of the Dunham family or Obama’s father in Kenya and ended because Obama lied about his marital status. This according to a August 22, 2008 article by the Washington Post that said, “Obama seemed adept at walling off various aspects of his life. He eventually told Ann about a former marriage in Kenya but said he was divorced, which she would discover years later was a lie.”  The article said that Ann’s mother called her “stubborn and nonconformist,”  and that her daughter “often did startling things, but none were more stubborn or surprising than her relationship with Obama.” The article went on to say that the senior Obama finished his degree and graduated in June 1962. “Then, before the month was out, he took off, leaving behind his still-teenage wife and namesake child. He did not return for 10 years, and then only briefly.” Ann’s Second Marriage After the birth of her son, Ann left her studies to care for her baby.  Around 1967, Ann returned to the University of Hawaii and got a degree in Mathematics.  Meanwhile, across the Pacific and on the other side of the mainland Barack Obama Sr. was completing his studies at Harvard.   By now the divorce was final and  the Washington Post reported that she had met and married another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro.  Ann and Barack Jr., who about this time got the nick name of Barry, moved with him to his home country, Indonesia. Transgendered Nanny Sometime in1969, the Soetoro’s hired a nanny named Evie.   According to a March 8, 2012 article by the New York Daily News, Evie “was born male but considers herself a woman.”  The article said, “Evie started caring for 8-year-old ‘Barry’ Obama in 1969 when he lived in Indonesia’s capital with his mother, Ann Dunham, who had arrived in the country two years earlier after marrying her second husband, Indonesian Lolo Soetoro.”   The article went on to say that,” Evie played with Obama and picked him up from school. She worked in the home as a man and says she never let young Barry see her in women’s clothes, though neighbors remember seeing her leave the home in the evening dressed in drag.” Posted 02/21/14 ","Celebrities"
"Cancer can be caused by foods in plastics and that’s how Sheryl Crow gotcancer-Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dioxins/"," There are a several versions of this eRumor. The first to appear on the Internet was a message that says a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from the Castle Hospital (no location mentioned) appeared on television and said plastic containers should not be used for heating foods in a microwave oven. He said this is especially true if the foods contain fat. The message claims that the combination of fats and plastics will release dioxins into the food and into the cells of the body with a risk of cancer. The doctor recommended using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers instead in order to avoid the dioxin. Prepared foods such as TV dinners should be taken out of plastic containers before heating. The second version tells the story of a seventh-grade student who decided to do some experiments with microwave radiation on food wrapped in plastic. She is said to have enlisted the help of the National Center for “Toxicological”  Research in Arkansas.  The student allegedly found that not only are there carcinogens migrating from the plastic into food during microwaving, but other substances as well. This eRumor also lists an article about Dr. Edward Fujimoto saying that he appeared on a TV station in Huntsville, Alabama. Another version claims all this was in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center. Yet another version says that singer Sheryl Crow, who is suffering from breast cancer, got her cancer from drinking from plastic water bottles left in the sun and that got too hot and, as a result, were contaminated with dioxins. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find any research that supports the fear that food can become contaminated with dioxins either from plastic wrap or plastic in microwave ovens. It’s an understandable concern because dioxins are among the most poisonous chemical group known and steps have been taken by many world governments to reduce the amounts of dioxins in the environment. Dr. Edward Fujimoto is real and is the Manager of the Wellness and Lifestyle Medicine Department at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii. (not Alabama).  Part of this eRumor is the result of an interview he did on KHON-TV channel 2 in Hawaii on January 23, 2002. TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Fujimoto who said the eRumor quoted him fairly accurately.  His concern was whether a combination of ingredients, especially plastics and food fats, could result in food being contaminated by dioxins when heated in a microwave. That is his observation and he claims to have research substantiating it. TruthOrFiction.com has twice asked for him to give us that research but has never received it.  He said that he is surprised about how little Americans know about dioxins in everyday life because in Japan, the majority of the population knows about them and the country has enacted regulations to protect its people.  He explained that in his view, heating food in a plastic container will produce the release of dioxins and fat will absorb them. The amount of migration of dioxins to fat, he said, will be a function of the heat in the microwave, the type of plastic, the length of time of exposure, and the amount of fat that is in contact.  Dr. Fujimoto pointed out that the amounts of dioxins in any given piece of plastic or food that is microwaved in plastic is very small, but that the problem is that dioxins get into the human body and accumulate. He sad that in Japan, there has been a complete change in the way foods are packaged so that plastic is avoided. They use more glass, for example. In early 2004, a corrupted version of the eRumor started circulating that made it appear as though Dr. Fujimoto was also concerned about putting water in plastic bottles and freezing it, but he never addressed that.  This version of the eRumor also made it sound as though the plastic itself was the problem, not the plastic in combination with food and heat.  It says, for example, that the heat causes dioxin (sic) to “drip from the plastic” into the food but none of the researchers has claimed that. A variation of the bottled water version said that was how singer Sheryl Crow got cancer, by drinking bottled water and that she appeared on the Ellen show or the Oprah show to tell the story. Crow has been treated for breast cancer but she’s never blamed it on bottled water. Another version of eRumor about the seventh-grader has been a little more difficult to detail.  We’ve confirmed that there is a Dr. Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxilogical Research who, along with a Claire V. Nelson, published a paper at a professional event in Orlando, Florida in 1998 and it was on the subject of food contamination from plastic wrap.   We’ve not found the actual study, however, and have never received a response from Dr. Wilkes. The eRumor about Jon Wilkes and Claire Nelson appears to have come from the Options Newsletter published by People Against Cancer at www.peopleagainstcancer.com . The folks who make Saran Wrap have responded to the eRumor.  A statement by the SC Johnson company says the “plasticizer” in Saran Wrap is derivative of naturally occurring citric acid found in citrus fruits and is 100% dioxin free.  The statement further adds that dioxins can only be formed with chlorine is combined with the kinds of high temperatures associated with waste incinerators, temperatures like 1,500 degrees F. Even the most powerful microwaves are not capable of those temperatures, according to the company. SC Johnson says none of its products contains dioxins. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dioxins are both natural and man-made.  The man-made dioxins are released into the air from sources like waste incineration, from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil), and certain types of chemical processing.  Almost every person has been exposed to low levels of dioxins and the EPA says there is research that suggests that high levels of dioxins may be correlated with various health problems, although some of that is extrapolated from studies of animals, not humans. The only reference we could find about dioxins and microwaves was from an FDA publication that was concerned about dioxins resulting from the bleached manufacture of paper goods including milk cartons and some paper containers for microwave dinners.  That was not about plastics and high temperatures, however, and the levels of dioxins were described as safe. The Food and Safety Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has published guidelines for safe cooking in microwave ovens and warns against using materials that are not regarded as microwave safe. CLICK HERE for those guidelines.  You’ll note that one of the guidelines is to avoid letting plastic wraps touch food.  That is another issue, however, and not related to dioxins or high heat in microwaves. The Food and Drug Administration has also issued a statement about plastics and microwaves.v CLICK HERE for that document. The American Plastics Council has also posted a page on the subject. CLICK HERE for their take on the dioxin question. Somewhere along the way someone decided to add that all this information had appeared in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center but neither has promoted the dioxin story. Even though Johns Hopkins has not been the source of the eRumor, there have been enough emails that falsely attributed the story to them that the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health asked Dr. Rolf Halden, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Services at the school’s Center for Water and Health to address the concerns over dioxins. He said that the principal sources of dioxins are from various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and volcanic eruptions.  Plastics do not actually contain dioxins, he said, but wastes that contain certain compounds can serve as dioxin precursors when incinerated. According to Halden, most people are exposed to dioxins when eating meat and fish rich in fat because dioxins that have been sent into the atmosphere become attached to particles that fall back to the earth and get concentrated and store in the fat of fish and other animals. Halden said that the alleged danger or freezing water in plastic bottles is unfounded and an urban legend.  First, because there are no dioxins in plastics.  Second because freezing actually inhibits the release of chemicals.  He said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water in the bottles, not the bottles themselves.  He added that there is another group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle that could disrupt endocrine functions in humans and animals and that heating up the plastics could increase their being released into water and food. Regarding cooking with plastics, Halden said that whenever you heat something it increases the likelihood that chemicals could be pulled out.  he recommends using heat-resistant glass or ceramics for microwave cooking, just to be safe.

"ABC bleeps “Jesus” from the delayed broadcast of a TV Show-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/abc-jesus/"," It is alleged that ABC edited out the use of the name “Jesus” in a release of the morning talk show THE VIEW. The eRumor says that Joy Behar, one of the hosts of the  show issued a heart-felt “Thank you Jesus” for the  success of her weight-loss campaign. Her reference to Jesus was broadcast during the live show, but on the delayed West Coast release of the program, it was allegedly blocked. "," The eRumor circulated in several forms. One of them (below) is a letter from the Rev. Jerry Falwell.  Another is a WorldNews.com article based on a report from the Media Research Center. The story is true. It happened to the May 23, 2002 broadcast of THE VIEW, which is also hosted by Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, and Lisa Ling. The protest against ABC is by Christians who interpreted the incident as being anti-religious or anti-Christian.  ABC told CNN, however, that the name of Jesus came up in a humorous way and that the decision to bleep it was not meant to be one of disrespect to Jesus or to Christians but to be sensitive to those who might have been offended with the humorous us of it.  ABC said that the name Jesus can be used in a respectful way, but the network prohibits it from being used in exclamations. The eRumor gives the impression that Joy Behar’s comment was one of saying thanks to Jesus for her weight loss, but the script shows that it was more flippant than that.  Behar had been dieting and keeping track of her progress on the air.  During the May 23 program, Meredith Vieira made a comment about the fact that Behar’s ordeal of daily weigh-ins was now ended.  Behar’s joyful acknowledgement appears to over the end of the diet. TruthOrFiction.com viewed a video of the original broadcast.  Here is the transcript: Meredith Vieira: “So yesterday, yesterday if you saw this show, you know it was the last day of the weigh-in, the scale is gone.” Joy Behar: “Yes, and thank you, thank you, Jesus, is all I have to say! Goodbye to that damn scale and this whole diet. I’m sick of it!” The comment comes across as humorous gratitude for the end of the diet. The Falwell letter asks what would have happened if the name of Jesus had been used in vain instead of praise.  Would it have been taken out?  ABC says that’s what happened…a use of the name of Jesus in a way other than praise and that’s why it was taken out. Critics, however, say it is “political correctness run amok.”  Baher herself objected to the comment being taken out. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  It was not a heart-felt expression of praise to Jesus but was probably not meant to be disrespectful either. Baher describes herself as an “Italian Catholic.” ","Celebrities"
"The classic gospel song “Precious Lord” was written by bandleader Tommy Dorsey-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tommydorsey/"," The story of a jazz musician named Tommy who went through a personal tragedy that led to his writing the song “Precious Lord Take My Hand.” He was Tommy Dorsey, the great trombonist and band leader. "," There have been many printed       references to this story and connected it to the great American band       leader, Tommy Dorsey. But the classic gospel song “Precious Lord Take My Hand”       was actually written by a different man with the same name. The trombonist and band leader named Tommy Dorsey was born in 1905       and died in 1956. Tommy Dorsey the composer of “Precious Lord Take My Hand”       was a jazz pianist and composer was born in 1899 and died in 1993. He is regarded by many as the father of gospel music. After a successful career as a blues musician, he switched to gospel       music. For more than 40 years, he was the choir director Chicago’s Pilgrim       Baptist Church. The actual story of the tragic death of his wife is a bit different       from the eRumor. In an account in his own words written for Guideposts Magazine,       Dorsey said he was actually scheduled to be in St. Louis to sing for       a revival. He had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of       pregnancy When he left his home to head for St. Louis, he realized that he had       forgotten his music case, so he returned to get it and found his       wife sleeping. He stood next to her and felt that something was telling him to stay       home. He decided to leave and headed back to his car for the drive to the       meetings. The next night at the revival and after he had finished singing, a       telegram was handed to him that said his wife had just died. He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby       boy before she died. Before the night was over, the baby had died as well. Dorsey went through a difficult period after that. He said he wanted to give up serving the Lord and go back to jazz. One of the thoughts that haunted him was whether his reluctance to       leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he       had been disobedient by ignoring it. He vowed that he would never be insensitive to such a leading again. It was during a subsequent visit to a friend that he sat down at a       piano and found himself at peace and a melody being played. That became the song “Precious Lord Take My Hand.” Dorsey wrote, “ As the Lord gave me       these words and melody, He also healed my spirit. I learned that       when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from God,       this is when He is closest, and when we are most open to His       restoring power. And so I go on living for God willingly and       joyfully, until that day comes when He will take me and gently lead       me home.” ","Celebrities"

"," The alleged CNN page is a hoax. It’s not from CNN but has been created to make it appear to be. It pops up every now and again at various web addresses. Born Lesane Parish Crooks in the Bronx, Tupac Shakur was a best-selling Hip Hop artist who, police say, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September of 1996. The shooting has never been solved although Las Vegas police believe it was gang-related. Several conspiracy theories about Shakur’s death have circulated among his fans. Some speculate about who shot him including asking questions about whether it was a U.S. government assassination. Others say that he faked his death. Shakur’s last album before his death was The Don Killumaniti: The Seven Day Theory. Shakur is depicted on the cover of the album as being crucified and it was recorded under the pseudonym “Makaveli,” which alludes to Machiavelli, the Florentine statesman and philosopher who suggested faking ones own death in order to fool his enemies. In a music video released just two days after his death, Shakur was depicted as having been shot in a public place and going to heaven where he was an angel with other dead celebrities. Some of his fans expected him to reappear in 2003, seven years after his death. None of those close to Shakur have given credibility to the notion that he’s alive. Last updated 5/4/05 ","Celebrities"

"The truth about Martin Luther King-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mlk/"," A collection of alleged facts about Martin Luther King that are critical of the Civil Rights leader. "," Let’s take them one at a time: His name wasn’t Martin Luther       King- Confusing! According to all accounts,       the name on Martin Luther King’s birth certificate is Michael and       there is no evidence that he changed it. He didn’t pick the name Martin Luther out of the air, however. It was the name his father used and claimed to have given to his       son. According to Africana.com, Martin Luther King, Sr. said that his       son’s given name was Martin Luther but that the doctor who delivered       him put “Michael” on the birth certificate, something he       didn’t know until much later. Until adulthood, Martin Luther King, Jr. was known as “M.L.”       or “Michael.” Martin Luther King plagiarized       in college- Truth! The staff at the Martin       Luther King, Jr. Papers Project discovered a lot of plagiarism in       Martin Luther King’s writings and in a 1991 article in THE JOURNAL       OF AMERICAN HISTORY said that “plagiarism was a general pattern       evident in nearly all of his academic writings” including his       doctoral dissertation. Martin Luther King       plagiarized his famous “I Have a Dream” speech- Disputed! Critics have charged that King plagiarized that too by borrowing       from a speech given to the Republican convention in 1952 by an       African-American preacher named Archibald Carey, Jr. Some of them say he gave Cary’s speech word-for-word. It can probably be said that King borrowed from the idea of the       speech by Carey (who was a friend of King’s), but only the last       couple of paragraph’s resembled Carey’s speech and little of it is       word-for-word. Both men spun their remarks off the words of the song “My       Country ‘Tis of Thee.” King’s speech ended with: This       will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with       a new meaning, “My country, ’tis of thee, sweet land of       liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the       pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.”       And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So       let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let       freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring       from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring       from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado! Let freedom ring from the       curvaceous peaks of California! But not only that; let freedom ring       from Stone Mountain of Georgia! Let freedom ring from Lookout       Mountain of Tennessee! Let freedom ring from every hill and every       molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. When we let       freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every       hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up       that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews       and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands       and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, “Free at       last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!” Carey’s speech ended with: We, Negro Americans, sing with all loyal Americans: My country       ’tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing.  Land       where my fathers died, Land of the Pilgrims’ pride From every       mountainside Let freedom ring! That’s exactly what we mean–from every mountain side, let freedom       ring.  Not only from the Green Mountains and White Mountains of       Vermont and New Hampshire; not only from the Catskills of New York;       but from the Ozarks in Arkansas, from the Stone Mountain in Georgia, from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia–let it ring       not only for the minorities of the United States, but for the       disinherited of all the earth–may the Republican Party, under God,       from every mountainside, LET FREEDOM RING! King was under surveillance       because of his ties to communist organizations- Truth! David Garrow, the author of       “Bearing the Cross,” a book about Martin Luther King, says       that King’s criticism of the Kennedy administration drew       administration scrutiny. There was suspicion that two of his associates, including Stanley       Levinson, had disassociated from the Communist party as a cover to       work with and influence King. Despite extensive surveillance, the FBI was never able to find any       direct funding or other links between King and the Communist party. King had an obsession with white       prostitutes and used church funds for drunken parties – Denied! One of King’s closest       associates addressed rumors about King’s sexual activities in his       1989 book, “And the Walls Came Tumbling Down.” He said that King did have a weakness for women and engaged in       extramarital affairs. He denied reports that he was attracted to white women and said he       never knew of King to be involved with a white woman. As a part of its surveillance activities, the FBI did document some       sexual encounters involving Martin Luther King. We’ve not found any substantiation about prostitues, sex parties or       church funds being used for such. Last updated 1/3/04 ","Celebrities"

"," Mel Gibson has a passion for “The Passion.” It’s a $25 million movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Christ as well as his resurrection as described in the books of the Bible known as The Gospels. Opposition to the film, however, has not been only because it’s about Jesus. Religious themes including films based on the life of Jesus have come out of Hollywood before. Most of the controversy over the film has been based on concerns of critics who say it is anti-Semitic and is based on some of the unique perspectives of the traditionalist views of Gibson’s brand of Catholicism. Gibson says he has no agenda for the film except to be as faithful to the Gospel accounts as possible and that includes the role of some of the Jewish leaders of Jesus’ time who called for his execution. During his interview with Bill O’Reilly, Gibson said the film was not meant to offend Jews. Some Jews fear a backlash from the graphic portrayal of the First Century leaders. Supporters of the film say it’s not anti-Semitic because it doesn’t dismiss Jews collectively, but only the mentality of the leaders who were threatened by Jesus and wanted him killed. The positive characters in the film are also Jews including Jesus himself. A lot of the controversy over the film was launched in March, 2003, by an article published in the New York Times magazine written by free-lancer Christopher Noxon. He was the one referred to in the O’Reilly interview as writing a “hit piece.” In the article, he examines Gibson’s Catholicism and calls it “splinter group of conspiracy-minded Catholics, mystics, monarchists and disaffected conservatives.” The article also talks about Mel Gibson’s 84-year-old father, Hutton Gibson, who has been a prolific author on religious themes including his opposition to changes in the Catholic church since Vatican II in the 1960’s. Noxon says the elder Gibson told him in an interview that the Holocaust didn’t really happen although he concedes that he doesn’t know that those views are shared by Mel Gibson.

"John Denver an Army Sniper? – Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/denver-sniper/"," There are various versions that say he was a sniper in Vietnam and decorated for his service. One even says he was a sniper during World War II. "," There is no evidence that John Denver ever served in the military. He was born in 1943, which made him the right age for serving in Vietnam, and grew up in an Air Force family. For him, however, the Vietnam years were spent in music. According to his biography, he attended Texas Tech in the early 1960’s, but dropped out in 1964 to move to Los Angeles where he became a member of the Chad Mitchell Trio.

"Denzel Washington spontaneously paid for a new Fisher House at BrookeArmy Medical Center-Fiction! But he later came through!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/denzel-brooke/"," The eRumor describes a visit by actor Denzel Washington to “Brookes” Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. He saw the buildings known as “Fisher House,” where families of hospitalized soldiers can say for little or no charge while visiting.  He is described as having asked how much it costs to build one, pulled out his checkbook, and wrote a check for the full amount. "," Denzel Washington did make a visit to the Brooke (not Brookes) Army Medical Center (BAMC) in San Antonio, Texas, in December, 2004. Among other things, he participated in a ceremony awarding Purple Hearts to three soldiers and visited several others. He also toured the Fisher House facilities there, was impressed with what they were doing, and did indicate a desire to support it. An eRumor got started that he dramatically pulled out his checkbook on the spot and wrote a check for the cost of building an entire house, which was not true. Fisher House says the confusion may have come when an announcement was made later in that a new $1-million facility was going to be built. It was at the same time as a mention that Denzel Washington had pledged a donation to Fisher House.  Four months later, however, he came through “in a big way”, according to the folks at Fisher House.  They won’t disclose the amount of his gift, but Fisher House spokesman James Weiskopf says it’s one of the largest in the organization’s history and that Denzel Washington has agreed to serve on the Fisher House board of trustees. Fisher House is a program that provides special housing at each of the Army’s major medical centers for the families of soldiers who are receiving medical treatment, often from being wounded on duty.  Fisher house is either a facility or a group of facilities where family members can stay for no cost or reduced cost, which helps ease the burden of possibly having made a long and expensive trip to be by the bedside of a family member and to make it possible for even low income families to be able to stay close by.

"Denzel Washington with Katie Couric and Meryl Streep-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/denzel/"," This eRumor tells of an appearance by Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep on NBC with Katie Couric on August 13, 2004, and talking about their film “Manchurian Candidate.” It describes Denzel Washington as prevailing against anti-Bush and anti-Republican statements. "," The interview by Katie Couric was with Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and director Jonathan Demme and took place in July, 2004 not August. (Couric was in Athens covering the Olympics in August.) It is true that the interview, which was prompted by the actors’ new film “Manchurian Candidate”, did get into politics, but the eRumor is someone’s exaggerated and cynical account of what was said, and is not entirely accurate. During the discussion about the film, Karie Couric said, “…lately, it seems the world of Hollywood and politics have collided, due in large part to Michael Moore’s controversial “Fahrenheit 9/11″ and the lengthy list of luminaries who attended that recent fundraiser for Senator John Kerry.” Meryl Streep interjected that she was at that event. Couric commented on some of Streeps statements at the event regarding Jesus Christ and whether the “president’s personal savior” would have dropped bombs on Baghdad or voted for a war president. Then Couric said that some people think Hollywood folks should stick to acting. Denzel Washington reacted to that by saying, “I don’t know what Hollywood folks are, first of all. Hollywood is a town that has some stars on the sidewalk. I don’t know anybody from there. So, I don’t– that’s like saying– calling you a type of folks. I’m not a Hollywood folk. I don’t know who they are.” Couric replied, “”Okay, all right, well, let me rephrase the question. Are you one of those people that—” Denzel Washington interrupted with “Ah, there you go. Am I one of those people? Hmmm, isn’t that interesting?” Couric clarified that she was asking whether he was one of the people who would rather keep his political views private. She then asked how he felt about the current political situation. He replied, “You know, I haven’t seen ‘Fahrenheit 9/11,’ because I live in America. I grew up here. I’m an ex-slave. I’m a result of what this country can do. So it’s nothing new to me. I’m not surprised at all. It’s just business as usual.  What I want to talk about is, what are we doing right now, today, for these young kids that are coming home? Are we embracing them? I don’t hear about them being lifted up. I mean, I’m not just talking about a parade but—” Washington never said the words “Do you mean “You People” as in me as a Christian, or do you mean “You People” as in me as a REPUBLICAN?” and he did not say that “Fahrenheit 911” was “propaganda and lies distorted to support a cynical democratic film director’s views.” Those are the words of whoever originated the eRumor.

"A French woman got one of Princess Diana’s kidneys in atransplant-Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:42:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dianakidney/"," The story is that a French woman claims to have been given Princess Diana’s kidney in a transplant. "," It is apparently true that Francoise Gaellar did receive a transplanted kidney on September 2, 1997, two days after Princess Diana died as the result of an automobile accident in Paris. None of the authorities will confirm that any organs were taken from Diana’s body and they have tried to downplay the woman’s claims. But she says she’s got a “belief” that the kidney she received is from Princess Diana and it’s become a matter of belief among the citizens of the small village where she lives as to whether it’s true. She compiles several pieces of evidence. She says that her doctor told her she would need a kidney from a donor roughly her size and age. Diana was 36 and 5′ 10″ when she died. Gaellar 38 and 5′ 8″. She says that she was hospitalized and gravely ill when on the morning of 9/2/04 she was taken by ambulance to a hospital where the transplant was to take place and that the ambulance driver joked with her that she was going to be getting a kidney from Princess Di and that she would have “royal blood.” Then the hospital staff hinted that she was getting Diana’s kidney and told her to keep it secret. She claims that ever since the transplant she’s found herself with a propensity to speak English more frequently than before. An article in the London Daily Mail quotes experts who say such events have been reported in the past. The article cites the case of an 18-year-old girl who had a heart transplant from an 18-year-old musician and poet and the girl suddenly developed a passion for music and poetry. It is claimed that when she met the boy’s parents, she could finish phrases of some of the lyrics.

"," This is a hoax. It’s not Johnnie Cochran’s headstone. The picture was created using a website that has a feature called The Original Tombstone Generator . Whoever created it did not spell his name correctly. Cochran used “Johnnie” for his first name, not “Johnny.” When the famous attorney died on 3/29/05, there was speculation about whether he privately believed in O.J.’s innocence or whether he merely took that stance publicly in order to serve as his attorney. Close associates and family have said, however, that he never wavered in his stance that O.J. did not commit the crime. O.J. Simpson was famous as a college and professional football player, a television sports commentator, and sometime actor. His former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a man named Ron Goldman were killed at Nicole Brown Simpson’s residence on the night of 6/12/94. Both were stabbed and Nicole Brown Simpson’s throat was cut. O.J. Simpson was briefly taken into custody for questioning but released and on 6/17/94 when he was about to be arrested and charged with the murders, he became involved in one of the most highly publicized and televised police chases in history. It was a low speed event which showed Simpson riding in a white Ford Bronco on the freeways of Los Angeles talking on his cell phone and at times holding a gun to his head. The Bronco was driven by Simpson’s friend and fellow athlete Al Cowlings.  Simpson was finally taken into custody when they returned in the Bronco to his home in Brentwood on the west side of the Los Angeles area.  Although Cowlings claimed that he was taken hostage at gun point and forced to take part in the famous low speed pursuit by Simpson he was charged with aiding a fugitive and released on bail. O.J. Simpson’s highly publicized trial resulted in his being found not guilty.

"Untimely Deaths of Famous People Who Mocked God – Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:39:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/untimely-deaths/"," A forwarded email with examples of untimely deaths of people who mocked God. The email quotes Galatians 6:7 and lists a group of people who all mocked God and died.  The first example is of former Beatle John Lennon who said that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.   Also included in the list are Marilyn Monroe, a rock singer who sang that he was on a “Highway to Hell”,  a Brazilian president elect, a Brazilian singer and the man who built the RMS Titanic. "," This eRumor suggests that God wiped out certain people for statements they made about him. Whether that is true is known only to God, but we can explore whether they really made the statements attributed to them. John Lennon (1940-1980) did say in 1966, “Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn’t argue about that. I’m right and I will be proved right. We’re more popular than Jesus now. I don’t know which will go first – rock n’ roll or Christianity.”   Fourteen years later, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in New York City on December 8, 1980. The American teen magazine “Datebook” reprinted the “We’re more popular than Jesus” interview which caused a stir of protests and a rash of Beatle record and memorabilia burnings on the streets in the US.  Beatles manager, Brian Epstein released a statement saying that the words of John Lennon had been taken out of context and while in Chicago Lennon and the Beatles called a press conference and apologized to the world for his comment. The band heard of threats from the Ku Klux Klan, predictions that they would all die in a plane crash or a hurricane.  This was about 2 years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the band made a decision to stop touring and focus their attention to work in the recording studio. YouTube Video of the John Lennon Comment about Jesus John Lennon was a Rock and Roll musician who co-founded the popular British Invasion Band called the Beatles in the 1960’s. Lennon and co-writer Paul McCartney wrote hundreds of songs together along with George Harrison and Ringo Star and together they remained at the top of the charts for nearly a decade. Lennon was notorious for his little quips and often answered reporter’s questions off answers the top of his head.   One of the earliest remarks like these was when asked how the Beatles found America, Lennon responded, “Turn left at Greenland.” The Fab Four might have began in England but they gained European popularity in the rock and roll school of hard knocks working the taverns of Hamburg Germany.   The band returned to England where they were discovered playing at a nightclub by Brian Epstein who landed them a record deal and there first hits “Please Please Me” and “Love Me Do” skyrocketed them to fame.  Their 1963 US tour the U.S. included a Sunday Night live performance on the Ed Sullivan Show which introduced the for mop tops to the nearly every American family.  The band had a long run on the hit parade and in 1969 broke up and each Beatle pursued their individual solo careers.    In the Beatles Anthology documentary , George Harrison said, “They gave their money and they gave their screams, but the Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems.  Which is, you know,  much more difficult thing to give.” In his book, “Skywriting By Word of Mouth”, Lennon wrote that he and the group had grown weary of touring and thanked Jesus for the comment that drove the band from the road and into the studio where they recorded their most creative projects. After the breakup of the band, John Lennon wrote a couple of songs about God.  In his first solo album Lennon wrote, “God is a concept, by which we can measure, our pain.”   This was a song where John list Beatles, Bible, Jesus, Zimmerman (Bob Dylan), kings, yoga, Kennedy, and mantra as things that he does not believe in and says he just believes in himself and his wife Yoko. Seven years before his death, in 1973, Lennon’s biggest solo hit entitled “Imagine” included the lyrics, Imagine there’s no Heaven, it’s easy if you try.  No Hell below us, above us only sky.”  Many interpreted the song to be a message against religion but this was John Lennon vision of the world living in peace and not fighting over spiritual ideals or materialism. The question is, why would God wait so long to smite John Lennon? Tancredo Neves (1910-1985) He was elected president of Brazil in  January 1985.   Neves underwent surgery before his inauguration and was unable to take office.  Vice president elect José Sarney Costa temporarily assumed the presidency.  Neves never recovered and died from complications following his surgery.   We have not found any evidence that he made the statement about God.

Marilyn Monroe (1926 – 1962) was married at the age to 21 to her first husband, Jimmy Dougherty.   According to the bio on Monroe’s official web site, Dougherty, said of his wife, “She was a sweet, generous and religious girl.”  Monroe was reared as a foster child in a devoutly Christian family in Hawthorne, California but there is not much information about what her spiritual beliefs were before she died.  Monroe’s death was ruled to be “acute barbiturate poisoning” by Los Angeles County Coroner,  Dr. Thomas Noguchi.   A spokesperson for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association told TruthOrFiction.com that there was no discussion between Marilyn Monroe and Billy Graham. Bonn Scott (July 9th, 1946 –  February 19, 1980)   was the co-writer of the ACDC 1979 popular song “Highway to Hell” and at the age of 33 was pronounced dead on arrival at Kings College in London, England. The cause of death was asphyxiation as a result of vomiting after passing out after a night of heavy alcohol consumption.  The song Highway to Hell lyrics referred to the self destructive lifestyle of the rock and roll artist with the lyrics:  “Hey Satan, payin’ my dues. Playing in a rocking band.  Hey Momma, look at me I’m on my way to the promised land.  I’m on the highway to hell.” The RMS Titanic was built in 1911 for the White Star Line at the the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast in the United Kingdom.  According to the archives.gov web site an unknown White Star Line employee at the time of Titanic’s launch on May 31, 1911 said, “Not even God himself could sink this ship.”  It is not known who this person was or if in fact he built the Titanic.

"Sylvester Stallone a Christian-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stalone-christian/"," Actor Sylvester Stallone found renewed commitment to Christianity through his work on the “Rocky” film series and has “surrendered his life to the Lord Jesus Christ.” "," Sylvester Stallone said he had renewed faith in Jesus while promoting a new film in the “Rocky” series in 2006. This eRumor was later proven false, however, when the actor rescinded the claim that he was a born again Christian. In a video interview with 700 Club host Pat Robertson in 2006, Stallone outlined his religious reawakening. He said he had turned to Jesus and put his life into God’s hands. “There was a time when I was a very strict Catholic,” Stallone told Robertson. “Then, when I got to Hollywood, all of the sudden you’re given the keys to the candy store and temptation abounds, and I started to believe my own publicity. No question, I admit it, I lost my way. But every time I came back to ‘Rocky’ I was given a new shot in the arm, a new reawakening.” In an interview with GQ Magazine in 2010, however, the actor denied being an atheist but said he didn’t belong to a structured church. “I have no opposition to it,” Stallone said. “I think there’s great nuggets of knowledge in there, some wonderful rules to live by. Then the flip side is the amount of agony that’s caused. Original sin. That guilt. How they say, ‘if you really believe, you have to suffer for Jesus.’ Guys in military school would stick their hand into a cauldron of scalding water and yell, ‘I’m doing it for Jesus!’ I was at a retreat, and the priest said, ‘if you can’t hold your hand over this candle for five seconds, imagine what an eternity in hell will be like.’ I put my hand over the flame for two seconds, then I pulled it away. The priest says, ‘Sit down and be quiet!’ I never got over that….” Despite the actor’s revelations, a series of blogs and videos resurfaced on the Internet in late 2013 that included quotes that Stallone made about being a Christian from 2006. The TruthorFiction.com Team has reached out to a Stallone representative about the actor’s current stance on Christianity. Future updates will be posted here when they develop.

"," It is common for rumors about     a last-minute conversion experience to circulate about celebrities who     have died. Steve Irwin’s standing before God was known only to him and to God, but     this particular rumor about his having made a visible commitment to     faith at an Australian church two weeks before his death is false. The version that circulated quickly around the Internet in     mid-September, 2006, was said to be from a pastor from a nearby     city.  It claimed that Irwin made his decision in front of the     congregation at Kings Church in Buderim, Queensland, Australia. Another version said that Irwin had also paid off all the debts of the     church just before he died. Sheree Penny of the King’s Christian Church in Buderim told     TruthOrFiction.com, however, that the story is not true.  She said     that Irwin’s wife, Terry, and her children had attended the church in     the past but that neither Terry nor Steve had attended recently.

"Stuart (or Russ) Hamblen, Billy Graham, John Wayne, and Hamblen’s Song It Is No Secret-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stuarthamblin/"," The story of a Hollywood celebrity from the 1950’s named Stuart (some versions say Russ) Hamblen who was converted to Christianity as the result of a young evangelist who held meetings in Los Angeles.  Hamblen is said to have showed up drunk at the evangelist’s hotel at 2am asking for prayer, but the evangelist refused to pray for him, although he invited him in to talk.  As a result, Hamblen accepted Jesus and it turned his life around but he was rejected by Hollywood and went through hard times until a friend asked him if he missed his old life and Hamblen replied by saying “It is no secret what God can do.”  The friend thought that was a good song title and Hamblen went on to write it and it became a hit.  The story says the evangelist was Billy Graham and the friend who suggested the song was John Wayne. "," The story of Stuart Hamblen, Billy Graham, and John Wayne is true but this account of it includes some misinformation. Stuart Hamblen was a popular singer, songwriter, actor, poet, and radio personality from the 1930s through the 1950s.  He was first a hit on radio but appeared in films with Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and John Wayne and wrote several chart-topping country songs.  Some have called him radio’s first singing cowboy. Billy Graham came to Los Angeles in 1949 for what became an historic evangelistic crusade.  Graham’s long time associate and crusade song leader Cliff Barrows told TruthOrFiction.com that Graham’s appearance on Hamblen’s radio show was arranged as part of the publicity for the crusade, not because Hamblen wanted to poke fun at Graham.  Although Hamblen was known for his hard living and drinking, he had been reared as the son of a Methodist minister and warmly welcomed Graham as a guest.  It was at that interview that Graham extended an invitation to Hamblen to attend the crusade and he accepted.  According to Barrows, Hamblen later contacted Graham at his hotel and asked to talk.  The result was that he “surrendered his life to Christ.”  He was not drunk and Graham did not refuse to pray for him, according to Barrows.  Hamblen’s became the first publicized conversion from the 1949 crusade and contributed to the decision to extend the event, which lasted for 8 weeks and put Billy Graham on the map. Barrows said that it was on a street in Hollywood that Hamblen later ran into John Wayne who asked him about the rumor around town that he’d changed his ways.  Hamblen told Wayne that it was no secret what God had done for him and that he could do it for Wayne too.  Wayne said it sounded like a song and suggested he write one.  The result was one of Hamblen’s best known tunes, It is No Secret What God Can Do. It was a crossover song that is regarded as the first to have been #1 in the gospel, country, and pop categories.  The original manuscript of It is No Secret is buried in the cornerstone of one of the Copyright Buildings of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. After his conversion Hamblen announced that he was going to devote his time to “serving Christ” and he started a new radio program titled The Cowboy Church of the Air which became nationally syndicated.  A confrontation developed with his sponsors, however, when he told them that he would refuse to advertise alcohol.  His much publicized departure from the program resulted in his being asked to run for President of the United States in 1952 under the banner of the Prohibition party.  He accepted and ran fourth to Republican Dwight Eisenhower who was elected president. update 02/10/09 ","Celebrities"

It is a one-year show based on A Course in Miracles.  Winfrey’s web    site describes the program as “a self-study program of spiritual    psychotherapy contained in three books. It is not a religion, but rather a    psychological mind-training base on universal spiritual themes.” Marianne Williamson is a popular lecturer who has authored several books    and promotes z”A Course in Miracles.” A Course In Miracles first came out in 1976.  Psychologist Helen    Schucman describes herself as the “scribe” of the book rather than the    author.  She said that she and fellow psychologist William Thetford    “scribed” the book from an “inner source.”  Schucman has said that it    was channeled to her by Jesus Christ.

You know, we’re to the point now where we just kind of want the guy to go away. RUSH: (chuckles) Well… CALLER: I spoke with a bunch of fraternity brothers as well, and we all kind of agree, you know, he’s a risk anymore. RUSH: Do you think he’s gonna go away? Do you think they’re gonna get rid of him? Do you think they’ll bench him? Do you think they’ll suspend him? CALLER: Nah. RUSH: Nah. CALLER: Nah, he’ll probably stay around. RUSH: It’s the student body. Whatever percentage of the attends at an FSU game is student body, that’s who’s gonna give ’em a standing O. The kids. CALLER: Probably. I wouldn’t be surprised at that at all. RUSH: Yeah, that’s what it’s about. CALLER: But as far as — RUSH: I don’t think the adults will. Some of them may not have even heard what happened yet.

"," This forwarded email has been falsely attributed to journalist and author Steven Levy. Some of the text is based on commentary delivered by writer, performer and game show host Ben Stein, who is Jewish, on December 18, 2005, on CBS Sunday Morning. TruthorFiction.com reported in 2007 that Stein had written the first paragraph of the forwarded email, but an unknown author added the second paragraph that begins, “In light of recent events…” Stein’s commentary, which is titled “My Christmas Confession,” typically goes viral each year as Christmas approaches. The forwarded email once again gained steam in 2011 after Stein delivered another commentary on CBS Sunday Morning in which he said that he and his wife celebrated Christmas “big-time.” “I love Christmas for much more for than basic reasons,” Stein said. “Christmas is about something huge. You can be saved if you simply make a contract to believe in God and (some add) if you act right. It has nothing to do with how you were born or into what tribe. This is a revolutionary, stupendous freeing of human spirit. This is why Christmas is such a joyous time for people, whether Jews or Christians, or anyone else, who want to believe that we humans can be forgiven and go on to lead lives of triumph no matter what has happened in the our past.” Another of the forwarded email’s claims, that the White House Christmas tree would be referred to as a “holiday tree” for the first time this year, is false. The White House has used the term “Christmas tree” every year that it has been on display in the Blue Room since 1966. Posted 10/28/14 ","Celebrities"

"Dr. James Dobson endorsed homosexual marriage?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dobson-partnerships/"," TruthOrFiction.com has had inquiries about whether pro-family advocate Dr. James Dobson of Focus On The Family has altered his long-standing conservative views on marriage and is now in favor of granting controversial domestic partner privileges to homosexual couples.  The questions arise because of Dobson’s support of a “reciprocal-beneficiary contracts” bill being considered by the Colorado legislature. "," There is dispute over the proposed Colorado legislation but as far as Dr. James Dobson is concerned, no dispute about his stance on marriage.  Focus on the Family says his support of Colorado Senate Bill 166 does not reflect a change in his long-standing opposition to homosexual  marriage or domestic partnerships. The legislation was introduced by Colorado state Senator Shawn Mitchell, who is described as a conservative pro-family Republican. After Dobson announced his support of Senate Bill 166, Dr. Paul Cameron, president of the Family Research Institute in Colorado Springs, Colorado (not to be confused with the Family Research Council in Washington D.C.) called the decision “madness.” In a statement released by his office, Cameron said “The…bill is a political compromise that would provide gay and lesbian couples with many of the benefits of marriage without having to be married.”  He refers to is as “marriage-lite.”  He accused Dobson of endorsing gay rights. In a strong response to Cameron Dobson said, “I don’t know what in the world has gotten into Paul Cameron that made him make a statement like this. I’ve never endorsed any bill granting gay partners legal rights currently reserved for married couples. That is sheer nonsense.” There was also an article critical of Dobson posted briefly on the website of conservative commentator and former presidential candidate Alan Keyes.  It was written by a frequent contributor to the site at www.renewamerica.us , Andrew Longman.  After being contacted and told that Dobson was not supporting the homosexual agenda, the article was taken down and apologies posted by both Keyes and Longman. According to a 2/15/06 article on Focus On The Family’s CitizenLink web site, the Colorado legislation would streamline certain legal relationships that are already allowed under Colorado law such as powers of attorney, decisions about medical care, and administration of property after death. Dale Schowengerdt, legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund is quoted as saying that Senate Bill 166 does not give benefits based on status, such as homosexuality, which is true of civil unions and domestic partnerships. Homosexual activists don’t like the bill because it doesn’t go far enough to accomplish their goal of homosexual marriage or full domestic partnerships. Schowengerdt adds that several states have similar laws and that, in his view, they actually protect marriage. Focus on the Family says that Dobson’s support of reciprocal-beneficiary legislation is not new.  Focus supported such a bill in Hawaii in 1997 that helped protect marriage in that state from redefinition. “All this bill does is say: If you have a need to be in one of these contractual relationships with someone you legally can’t marry, you could do this through a notarized contract filed with the county clerk and — instead of paying thousands of dollars to an attorney for individual contracts — you can have one packaged contract offered to you,” the article explains. Carrie Gordon Earll, director of issues analysis for Focus on the Family Action, is quoted as saying that the bill does not advance homosexuality.  It helps a lot of people such as parents with a disabled adult child living at home, sisters sharing property, grandparents and grandchildren and many other people who would choose those closest to them to have power to fulfill legal wishes for them.  In other words, anyone who would have normally had to go through a complex and expensive process to define an important legal relationship that is not marriage. Cameron disagrees and says the bill grants homosexual couples some of the benefits currently reserved for married couples and their families and that Dobson’s endorsement of the bill advances the cause of homosexuals.

"Charles Darwin became a Christian on his deathbed and renounced evolution-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/darwin/"," Charles Darwin, the author of THE SPECIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION in 1859 and the champion of evolution, renounced his evolutionary theory and became a Christian on his deathbed.  This was reported by noblewoman Lady Hope who said she visited Darwin at his home in England at the close of his life.  She described him as reading the book of Hebrews in the New Testament of the Bible.  She also said that he regarded his writings about evolution to be questions that people made into a religion.  Lady Hope said Darwin asked her to conduct a meeting outside a summer house he owned so he could hear the singing of the hymns. "," The question of whether Charles Darwin accepted Christianity and rejected evolution is an emotional and intense one.  To many Christians, Darwin is a villain who articulated a godless creation.  To others, he is a brilliant hero who led the way to an enlightened view of where we came from.  There are researchers and authors who have worked hard to prove and disprove any notion that he converted to Christianity and TruthOrFiction.com’s conclusion is that when all is said and done, there is not enough good evidence that the story is true.  We stop short of declaring it fiction, but regard it as not sufficiently proven.  The report about Darwin’s change of heart comes from one person, Lady Hope, an energetic Nineteenth Century Christian, while many members of Darwin’s family denied it and there is nothing from Darwin’s friends, colleagues, his own statements or writings to substantiate it.  If Darwin did experience something so dramatic as a conversion to Jesus Christ and a complete revision of the theory of evolution that characterized his life and work, there isn’t a shred of evidence of it outside of the claims of Lady Hope. The book THE DARWIN LEGEND by James Moore is one of the most recent and cautious analyses about the Darwin conversion story.  For many years, detractors claimed that Lady Hope either didn’t exist or never visited Darwin.  Moore demonstrates that she did indeed exist and may very well have visited him.  He also concludes, however, that her account of what happened is not reliable. A response to Moore’s book is TRUE SCIENCE AGREES WITH THE BIBLE by Malcolm Bowden.  His attention to detail is valuable reading, but in trying to argue that the conversion story may be true, he has to do a lot of speculating about what Lady Hope, Darwin, or Darwin’s family might have been thinking.
