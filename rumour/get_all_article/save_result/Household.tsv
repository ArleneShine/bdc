"Bounce Fabric Softener Dryer Sheets Work as Bug Repellent –Truth! & Misleading!","2015-08-14 13:29:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/bounce-fabric-softener-dryer-sheets-work-as-bug-repellent/"," Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets repel bugs like mosquitoes, gnats and flies. "," The rumor that Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets work as an insect repellant is true, but it’s also misleading. Bounce fabric softener is scented with oil that works as a natural insect repellant, but low concentrations of it. So dryer sheets contain a natural insect repellant, but probably not enough to effectively repel most insects. Scientists did, however, find that Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets work as an insect repellent for at least for at least specific kind of insect: fungus gnats. Fungus gnats were put inside a plastic container that had two smaller containers connected to each side of it. One of the side containers had a Bounce fabric softener dryer sheet inside of it, and the other had nothing, according to a study published by HortiScience . After several days, just 12-18% of the fungus gnats were found inside the container with Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets. Meanwhile, 33-48% of the fungus gnats were in the other container. The experiment was repeated five times and scientists concluded that “Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets do in fact repel” fungus gnats. The scented oil in Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets that repelled fungus gnats is called linalool. Linalool , which is made from the oil of linaloe wood, is commonly used as an air freshener in household sprays and detergents. In higher concentrations, it’s also used as a pesticide. In fact, the EPA approved linalool for use as pesticide in 2009: This notice announces the availability of EPA’s final registration review decisions for the pesticides Trichoderma species (case 6050) and Linalool (case 6058). Registration review is EPA’s periodic review of pesticide registrations to ensure that each pesticide continues to satisfy the statutory standard for registration, that is, that the pesticide can perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment. Through this program, EPA is ensuring that each pesticide’s registration is based on current scientific and other knowledge, including its effects on human health and the environment. But there are trace amounts of linalool in Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets. Pesticides, meanwhile, have a 95% concentration of linalool. That means Bounce fabric softener dryer sheets do contain a natural insect repellant, but probably not enought to effectively repel insects in most situations ","Household"
"Ziploc Bags Full of Pennies and Water Keep Flies Away- Fiction!","2015-06-11 10:57:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ziploc-bags-full-of-pennies-and-water-keep-flies-away/"," Ziploc bags filled with water and pennies can be used to keep flies away. "," Ziploc bags full of water and pennies don’t act as a homemade fly repellent. This rumor has been circling the web for years, and people have been using it to scare away flies for even longer. The idea is that flies have poor eyesight, and water-filled bags create some type of optical illusion that scares them away. The most common version claims that light refracted in the water confuses the flies. Another version claims that flies are scared by their own oversized reflections in the bags. First, the claim that flies have poor eyesight is false . Their eyes are made up of thousands of individual lenses that can see polarized light and color spectrums that human eyes can’t: “House fly eyes can recognize even the slightest movements in a wide field. This allows the fly to see a far wider range, as well as detect and react to movement at a quicker pace than species with simple eyes. This is the reason that it is extremely difficult to swat a house fly.” That doesn’t mean all of those lenses don’t haywire when a fly looks into a bag of water, but experts say that it’s unlikely. A bug expert with the Audubon Institute told the New Orleans Times–Picayune he had experimented with the water bag trick, and it didn’t work: “(The bug expert) points out that flies are seasonal, they’re affected by wind, rain and other factors. There are lots of reasons people might come to believe the folksy water bags scare them off, but in his scholarly view, those reasons don’t, well, hold water.” The TV show “MythBusters” also experimented with the homemade flytrap and reported it to be a bust: “The Build Team made a rig consisting of three chambers separated by trap doors. The first chamber would hold the flies, the second would hold some rotten meat, and the third would hold both rotten meat and a bag of water. They then released over 5,000 flies from the first chamber and waited to see how many flies would go into each of the other two. After the chambers were sealed off, they let all the flies die and collected the corpses to weigh for comparison. The chambers with and without the water contained 35 and 20 grams of flies, respectively, busting the myth.” ","Household"

It is a phishing scam that was used by fraudsters to dupe people into giving up their personal information. Lowes responded directly to a number of posts about the $200 coupon on Facebook: “The post on Facebook is not affiliated with Lowe’s in any way. This is a phishing scam to try and gain personal and secure information. Please be careful when it comes to these sorts of pop-ups.” The offer for the so-called $200 Lowes coupon appeared in a pop-up window and encouraged people to fill out a form with their personal information in order to redeem it. Pop-up windows are regularly used in phishing scams. The National Consumer League warns : “Never enter your personal information in a pop-up screen. Sometimes a phisher will direct you to a real company’s, organization’s, or agency’s website, but then an unauthorized pop-up screen created by the scammer will appear, with blanks in which to provide your personal information. If you fill it in, your information will go to the phisher. Legitimate companies, agencies and organizations don’t ask for personal information via pop-up screens. Install pop-up blocking software to help prevent this type of phishing attack.” Trusting your instincts is one of the best ways to protect against scams like this.

"Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) Emit Radiation, Contain Mercury-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-03-31 23:15:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/compact-fluorescent-light-bulbs-cfls-emit-radiation-contain-mercury/"," Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are radioactive and add more toxicity to the environment than regular light bulbs because they contain mercury. "," This one is true, false and misleading all at once. There is truth in claims that CFLs give off ultraviolet (UV) radiation and contain mercury, but studies show that those concerns have been exaggerated. The debate over CFLs started in 2007 after President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act into law. The bill required screw-based light blubs to use fewer watts for similar brightness by 2014 to save energy. The bill also requires most light bulbs to be 60-70% more efficient than regular incandescent light bulbs by 2020. Many have interpreted the law to mean that consumers must use CFLs, but that isn’t the case. The law doesn’t restrict the types of light bulbs that can be sold, just the amount of energy they use. Right now, CFLs and LEDs meet the 2020 energy requirement, according to the bill . But that doesn’t mean more options won’t be available by 2020. Claims that CFLs are radioactive and toxic have been around since Congress introduced the bill. A page posted on the website Live Leak provides one example: “Consider this – instead of saving the environment, CFLs are actually destroying it. CFLs should be thought of as toxic technology, when mercury contamination, ultraviolet radiation, and radio frequency radiation are factored in. From cradle to grave, CFLs pose a danger to people’s health and well being, as well as adding even more toxicity to the environment. In fact, CFLs do not reduce a person’s carbon footprint and may even increase it in some situations. To make matters even worse, CFLs emit harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation. “ Let’s take a look at each of these claims. First, it’s true that CFLs emit ultra-violet (UV) radiation. Researchers at Stony Brook University found that UV leaked from cracks in the phosphor coatings on CFLs. Their study found that CFLs should not be used at close distances and should be placed behind glass covers. The UV radiation was on par with what is given off by standard fluorescent lights, so the risk for skin damage is not great. There is also a small amount of mercury in CFLs, as the eRumor claims. If a bulb breaks, there is some risk of mercury exposure, but, again, it’s not great, the National Institutes of Health reports : “’The amount of mercury gas coming off (broken CFLs) is over a milligram over a few days. If you put that milligram into a poorly ventilated room, the concentration can be over the recommended limit for children,” says Robert Hurt, the director of the Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation. ‘The overall risk is low, but it’s not zero risk, and there is definitely an opportunity to do better.’ “…Hurt’s research suggests that the peak for escaping mercury vapor lasts a few hours. The group also found that plastic bags leaked mercury vapor. ‘This new information may allow for modeling of airborne mercury concentrations following breakage, thus providing the capability to more fully assess the effectiveness of cleanup,’ says Roxanne Smith, a press officer for the EPA.” The EPA’s tips for cleaning up broken CFLs can be found here . Finally, the claim that CFLs add more toxicity to the environment than regular bulbs because of their mercury content is false. CFLs actually reduce the amount of mercury entering the environment because less energy is required to use them. That means less mercury-emitting coal needs to be burned, the National Institutes of Health reports . ","Household"
"Kerosene Cures Cancer-Fiction!","2015-03-19 17:20:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kerosene-cures-cancer/"," Kerosene can be used to cure cancer and other blood diseases. "," There’s no proof that kerosene kills cancer cells, but there’s plenty of proof that it can kill humans. This eRumor surfaced a number of years ago. A report by a person identified as Caro Huptn, the editor of the newspaper TAGO, claimed that a woman had cured more than 20,000 patients with kerosene. It has appeared on many alternative medicine websites, often with a disclaimer like this one: “The following report was given to us by a woman from Michigan. Nothing has been done to verify the information as it sounds quite unusual compared with the knowledge we already have that benefits the cancer patient. It is being printed only to pass on information that arrives at the FACT office, and possibly, for someone doing research to conduct a project to validate or negate the information. If the research is undertaken, we would appreciate receiving the report.” Outside of that one report about kerosene and cancer, there is no record of anyone named Caro Huptn, or the newspaper TAGO, on the Internet. But there has been plenty of research done on how kerosene affects humans, and it’s not good. In 2010, a group of researchers looked at the impact medicinal kerosene had on people in developing countries. The researches looked at cases where kerosene had been used to treat hemorrhoids, but its effect on people who used it to treat cancer would be the same. According to the study : “Kerosene and other petroleum oils were used as the drugs of choice for many medical problems in the past years. The most common use of kerosene was antiseptic aid for cuts and scrapes. Daily applications of kerosene were also used to treat head lice, athlete’s foot, animal problems including cracked or infected hooves, and worm infections… “Nowadays, it is obvious that kerosene chemical-based components are toxic materials for the human body. These materials were found to cause significant direct and indirect dangerous effects on health through inhalation, ingestion, injection, or local dermal contacts. These negative effects may lead to losing the functions of organs of body or lead to long-term disabilities. Although training and increasing of public awareness about these side effects may prevent self-therapy of kerosene, early diagnosis of these side effects can help in the results of care.” That means that even if kerosene could kill cancer cells, it would likely kill the patient along with those cells.

"Beware of potential pollution from certain candles-Truth!","2015-03-17 22:02:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/candles/"," An email is making the rounds that talks about a woman in Texas whose family has experienced a variety of health problems which she says are due to the lead content of some candles.  The email warns that burning candles in the home can lead to health problems. "," The Texas woman’s name is Cathy Flanders and she has been on a crusade to bring the problem of indoor pollution from candles to the forefront.  She has filed a lawsuit against the store that sold her candles which she says resulted in toxic levels of lead in her home and with serious medical consequences on her family.  Regardless of the merits of her case, it is true that indoor pollution from certain kinds of candles is becoming a focus of research and is one of the hot topics right now among professionals concerned with health issues in the home.  Not all the researchers are focused on lead and there are some who say they feel the danger from lead is reduced by the fact that U.S. candle makers have not used lead in candles for more than 25 years.  There is increased focus on what researchers say is a significant contribution of candles to soot residue in buildings, more than has previously been realized, and to what extent that soot can contribute to health problems.  While that is being studied, pollution experts recommend choosing candles from U.S. manufacturers that are made of hard wax, have low aromatic properties, burn with a low, even flame and with wicks that burn down evenly with the rest of the candle.  They also recommend keeping burning candles out of drafts and not allowing an extinguished candle to continue emitting smoke.

"," It is true that Procter       & Gamble contributed to a gay-supported campaign in Cincinnati. It is not true that Procter & Gamble has made a decision to explicitly       support homosexual marriage. In 1992 the Cincinnati, Ohio City Council approved an ordinance that prohibited discrimination       for, among other things, sexual orientation. A loud protest resulted from those who objected to homosexuality       being ranked along with race, gender, age, and religion as a reason       for protection. A year later, 62 percent of Cincinnati voters responded to that       action by passing an amendment to the city charter (Title XII) which forbids the city       from providing protected status to persons “because of       homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation.” It’s been a hot debate ever since and in November, 2004 the citizens of       Cincinnati voted to overturn that ordinance and to once again       include sexual orientation in protection from discrimination. Procter & Gamble’s headquarters is in Cincinnati and the company       made a $10,000 contribution to the group that was pushing for the       repeal of Article XII. Procter & Gamble said that its support of the repeal was not a       vote for homosexuality, but against discrimination. The American Family Association and Dr. James Dobson’s Focus on the       Family had encouraged a boycott of two of Procter & Gambles       products, Tide soap and Crest toothpaste, as a protest of the       company’s policies regarding homosexuality. In a statement, Dobson said that even though Procter & Gamble has       not officially endorsed homosexual marriage, its statements       “communicate the notion that restricting marriage to one man       and one woman is discriminatory.” updated 11/05/04 Subject: P&G policy leads to support for homosexual marriage CREST, TIDE MAKER GIVES MONEY, CLOUT TO REPEAL LAW     FORBIDDING SPECIAL RIGHTS FOR HOMOSEXUALS P&G policy leads to support for homosexual     marriage Dear Walter, Procter & Gamble, makers of Crest toothpaste and     Tide detergent, has publicly thrown their support and money behind the     homosexual political agenda. P&G recently wrote to their Cincinnati employees     <http://www.pgboycott.com/pginformation.pdf> urging them to     support the repeal of a city law that forbids giving special rights to     homosexuals. In 1993, the citizens in Cincinnati adopted the law by a     vote of 62% to 38%. P&G is now working to get that law repealed and     has given $10,000 toward that goal <http://www.pgboycott.com/pgcontributions.pdf>     . To our knowledge, Procter & Gamble is the first     company to support the political agenda of the homosexual movement. While not explicitly saying so in their public     announcement supporting the repeal, P&G clearly showed their support     for homosexual marriage. P&G said they “will not tolerate     discrimination [against homosexuals] in any form, against anyone, for     any reason.” To keep homosexuals from being legally married is     discrimination, which P&G says they will not tolerate.

Some warnings suggest calling the electric company and demanding that they replace these new meters with the old ones because they are vulnerable to hackers who intercept personal data through them. "," This is eRumor sounds like a conspiracy theory but there is little need for concern of loss of personal information or health. Smart meter on the left next to the old style electric meter A Southern California Edison employee told TruthOrFiction.com that smart meters do have radio transmitters to send encrypted data to the electric company. According to the a Frequently Asked Questions page on the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) smart meters operate typically at a frequency in the 902 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands.  The radio transmitter range is intended to be localized with output power of 1 watt or less.  The radio transmission is brief and not a signal that is sent throughout the day.  Once a smart meter is activated remotely by radio signal it then transmits data to a neighborhood concentrator, which are usually mounted on power poles.  That information is then relayed to the power company.    By these guidelines, a smart meter is not going to tell the power company when someone is using an electric toothbrush or watching television. Homeowners may be able to opt out and request their old meters back.  According to the Southern California Edison website there is an option to opt out of the smart meter program but it costs an additional $10 per month and there is also a one time $75 set up charge.  Those interested in opting out may contact their power companies for details. Are the transmissions from smart meters harmful? Smart meters, according to the ARRL, abide by and are protected by the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15, and are enforced by the Federal Communications Commission.  This regulation governs the operation of other radio devices, which are common household and personal items such as wireless networks, blue tooth accessories, automotive alarm and door remote controls,  cordless phones, wireless computer peripherals and portable fm transmitters for personal MP3 players.  The power output of these devices is intended to be low so as not to cause interference with other devices.  Low power transmissions at their designated frequencies are harmless.

It is known for its antibacterial qualities. The pure stuff is dangerous if not used correctly. There are also 30%-35% high strength solutions on the commercial market, typically found in health food stores but also sold as a disinfectant. There has been continuing controversy over using hydrogen peroxide either orally or through injection to treat a variety of internal ailments including arthritis and cancer.  Proponents say that the oxygen released by the breakdown of the hydrogen peroxide is medicinal.  Opponents say there isn’t good evidence of the health benefits and that there are circumstances in which hydrogen peroxide can be dangerous.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved those high strength hydrogen peroxide products for use internally and considers them dangerous.  In July, 2006, the FDA issued a warning about the high strength hydrogen peroxides, saying they could lead to serious health risks and even death.  A warning from the BC Cancer Agency in Canada said that over a three year period 6 children were seriously poisoned and one died from drinking the high strength hydrogen peroxide.

No more canker sores and your teeth will be whiter without expensive pastes. Use it instead of mouthwash- Truth! But Limited Use! The Merck Manuals recommended diluting the 3% hydrogen peroxide 50 percent with water, but suggest it as a rinse and part of a treatment for trench mouth, for example.  The FDA has approved 3% solutions of hydrogen peroxide for use as a mouthwash.  Most sources said to use it only for a short time, however, such as part of a treatment of a mouth infection.  A report from Well-Connected (written or edited by physicians at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital) recommended against extended use, saying that overuse may actually damage cells and soften tooth surfaces. We were not able to find any authoritative information about hydrogen peroxide and canker sores. 2. Let your toothbrushes soak [in] a cup peroxide to keep them free of germs- Unproven! We didn’t find anything authoritative about soaking toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide.  Because hydrogen peroxide degrades quickly when exposed to light, if you do soak a toothbrush, do it in freshly poured hydrogen peroxide.  Just keeping an open cup of the stuff around won’t do much good. 3. Clean your counters, table tops with peroxide to kill germs and leave a fresh smell. Simply put a little on your dishrag when you wipe, or spray it on the counters- Truth! 4. After rinsing off your wooden cutting board, pour peroxide on it to kill salmonella and other bacteria- Truth! The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved hydrogen peroxide as a sanitizer. 5. I had fungus on my feet for years – until I sprayed a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water on them (especially the toes) every night and let dry- Unproven! We were not able to find any authoritative source about foot fungus and treatment with hydrogen peroxide.  Again, we are assuming she means a 50/50 mixture of water and 3% hydrogen peroxide.  An actual 50/50 mixture of pure hydrogen peroxide and water would be too high a concentration to be safe. For many of us, hydrogen peroxide was one of the first things we put on a cut or a wound, but that is less recommended nowadays.  The reason, according to numerous medical sites, is that there is a downside to the hydrogen peroxide as well.  It also damages healthy cells that are needed for the wounds to heal and hinders them from getting to the area where the healing needs to take place. The HealthFinder publication of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says don’t use hydrogen peroxide on a wound because it interferes with healing. The U.S. Gymnastics team has followed the recommendations of researchers and uses soap and water for cleansing wounds and not hydrogen peroxide. The National Safety Council’s First Aid Pocket Guide (1996) says “DO NOT use hydrogen peroxide  It does not kill bacteria, and it adversely affects capillary blood flow and wound healing.”   The Mayo Clinic gives the same advice. 7. Put two capfuls into a douche to prevent yeast infections. I had chronic yeast infections until I tried this once or twice a week- Disputed! Interestingly enough, hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced in the vagina to deal with bacteria.  There is conflicting opinion among the experts, however, about whether douching with hydrogen peroxide is helpful or harmful and even some voices that doubt whether douching is necessary at all under normal circumstances. 8. Fill a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water and keep it in every bathroom to disinfect without harming your septic system like bleach or most other disinfectants will- But be sure you put the mixture into a bottle that filters out sunlight.  Also, it appears that hydrogen peroxide does not harm septic systems.  Again, this is probably a mixture of 50% water with the other half being 3% or 30% strengths of hydrogen peroxide. 9. Tilt your head back and spray into nostrils with your 50/50 mixture whenever you have a cold, plugged sinus. It will bubble and help to kill the bacteria. Hold for a few minutes then blow your nose into a tissue- Undetermined! We couldn’t find much about this in terms of research.  Again, if you choose to do it, this is probably referring to a mixture of 3% hydrogen peroxide with water. 10. If you have a terrible toothache and can not get to a dentist right away, put a capful of 3% peroxide into your mouth and hold it for ten minutes several times a day. The pain will lessen greatly. 11. And of course, if you like a natural look to your hair, spray the 50/50 solution on your wet hair after a shower and comb it through. You will not have the peroxide burnt blonde hair like the hair dye packages, but more natural highlights if your hair is a light brown, faddish, or dirty blonde. It also lightens gradually so it’s not a drastic change- Truth! One of the classic uses of hydrogen peroxide is to bleach hair. The concentrations are between 3% and 6%.  This suggestion to dilute with water probably applies to those solutions. 12. Put half a bottle of peroxide in your bath to help rid boils, fungus, or other skin infections- Undetermined! The half a bottle probably refers to a 3% solution. 13. You can also add a cup of peroxide instead of bleach to a load of whites in your laundry to whiten them. If there is blood on clothing, pour directly on the soiled spot. Let it sit for a minute, then rub it and rinse with cold water. Repeat if necessary- Truth! But Careful! The effectiveness of this method is a matter of experimentation, but the principle is sound.  Some of the so called “oxygen” bleaches contain hydrogen peroxide. Be careful about the suggestion to use it on spots.  Hydrogen peroxide is a bleach! 14 This list didn’t have it, but I use peroxide to clean my mirrors; there is no smearing, which is why I love it so much for this- Unproven! The original hydrogen peroxide eRumor did not include this.  Some of these were added by people along the way. 15. Gargle with hydrogen peroxide, put drops in the ear and nose to end colds, flu, chronic sinustis (including polyps], and infections. A repeat of some previous information. 16. Use as a vegetable wash or soak to kill bacteria and neutralize chemicals- Truth! We don’t know about the chemicals, but there are several credible references about the use of hydrogen peroxide on fruits or vegetables.  Research published by the Journal of Food and Science in 2003 showed effective results of using hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate apples and melons that were infected with strains of E.coli. 17. Disinfect your dishwasher or refrigerator- Undetermined! 18. Use it on trees and plants as a natural fungicide, insecticide, and as a weed killer- Undetermined! We found no research on the use of hydrogen peroxide as an insecticide, fungicide, or weed killer. 19. Clean with hydrogen peroxide when your house becomes a biohazard after its invaded by toxic mold, such as those with water damage- Truth! In a publication about “Healthy Homes,” the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) listed hydrogen peroxide as among the substances that can be used against mold, but also said there had not been enough research to recommend its use.  It is not known what molds hydrogen peroxide is most effective against or what the human health hazards may be from using it so extensively. Also, since hydrogen peroxide is a bleach, be careful where you use it in terms of preserving the colors in your home. Updated 8/5/06 ","Household"
"Instant Noodles Use Wax that Causes Cancer-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/instant-noodles/"," A Facebook post warns that instant noodles contain a wax coating that can cause cancer and requires up to two days for the body to digest.

"Injuries on children caused by cleaning “erasers”-Truth! &Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cleaningproducts/"," There are apparently different versions of this but they all warn that children can experience injuries on the skin from the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser or the Mr Clean Magic Eraser. One of the eRumors says that Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is being removed from store shelves because of containing formaldehyde. "," The bottom line is that there is a first-hand story of a child who experienced skin irritation from a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser but there is dispute about whether it was from chemicals or the abrasive action of the product from being rubbed on the skin. The story about Mr. Clean Magic Eraser being removed from the market is not true. Procter & Gamble Mr Clean Magic Eraser The eRumor claims that the Magic Eraser contains formaldehyde. If you review the government-required Material Safety Data Sheet, you see that one of the ingredients is “Formaldehyde-Melamine-Sodium Bisulfite Copolymer.”  That’s the name of the entire ingredient and it’s different than if the product had formaldehyde alone, according to Procter & Gamble. A company release said that “…the word ‘formaldehyde’ is in its chemical name. However, this ingredient is not formaldehyde and poses no health or safety risks. (Think of this name like ‘sodium chloride’, which is table salt. Sodium by itself can be dangerous, but sodium chloride – salt – is safe.).”  The company said that any formaldehyde found on its product would be in tiny amounts and a result of the manufacturing process and would be “actually less than what is found in indoor air.” Procter & Gamble denies that there is any danger from the product and adds “In fact, no ingredients in Magic Eraser are subject to any health-related labeling laws in North America or in the European Union.” ScotchBrite Easy Eraser The text of the eRumor about a mother’s experience with the ScotchBrite Easy Eraser is authentic.  It’s a first-hand account from the woman who runs a website named Kerflop .  Don’t know if that’s her last name but her first name is Jessica and the text of the eRumor is posted on her site.  The incident took place in 2006. She describes how her son (picture below) got “large, shiny, blistering red marks… across his cheeks and chin” from apparently rubbing a ScotchBrite Easy Eraser on his face.  She got advice over the phone from a poison center, which told her that products like the Easy Eraser and Magic Eraser “…have a pH of 8 – 10 and can cause chemical burns.”  They gave her first-aid instructions.  She then took her son to a hospital for treatment.  It is her contention that the product contained “a harmful alkaline or “base” chemical (opposite of acid on the pH scale) that can burn your skin.”  She describes his injuries as “chemical burns.” We have not found any experts who would agree with the comment from the poison control center that a pH of 8 – 10 can cause chemical burns.”  The pH scale measures the range of acidity on one hand and alkalinity on the other.  The scale ranges from 0 to 14. At the 0 end is solutions that are very acidic.  Lemon juice is about a 2, vinegar is around 3,. Pure water has a neutral pH of 7, which is and some soaps range up to a pH of 9. Although her story is about ScotchBrite’s Easy Eraser, she makes reference to the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser as well and notes that the original packaging of each did not include any warnings of harm from their use on the skin. The 3M company’s Material Safety Data Sheet shows that the product is made of polyurethane foam and melamine foam.  No other chemicals are listed. The sheet does indicate that there can be “mechanical abrasion” and Kerflop says that in January she got a note from 3M that said: “We have addressed the issue and are taking steps to change the packaging to warn other consumers of the potential reaction to using the product on the skin.” Updated 7/25/07 ","Household"
"Butter versus Margarine-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/butter-margarine/"," A list of comparative facts about margarine and butter. "," The heart of this eRumor, the comparison between butter and Margarine, has been circulating since 2005.  Later versions added the tidbit about Margarine being manufactured to fatten turkeys. We’ll go through the email one fact at time but it needs to be kept in mind that not every Margarine product is the same.  There are other spreads that are loosely called Margarine but may, for example, be part vegetable oil or a fat-free Margarine product. 1. Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys. When it killed The turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a Payback so they put their heads together to figure out what to do with this Product to get their money back. It was a white substance with no food Appeal so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in Place of butter. How do you like it? They have come out with some clever New flavorings- Fiction! According to the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers, Margarine was the idea of a Frenchman named Hippolyte Mege-Mouriez in response to a request from Emperor Louis Napoleon for ideas for a substitute for butter.  In 1869 he used margaric acid and the name of his formulation became known as Margarine. It became a hit in the United States in the late 1800’s. 2.  Both have the same amount of calories- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 100 calories.  A tablespoon of Margarine is 100 calories. 3.  Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study- Truth! But Updated! We didn’t find the “53%” study, but Harvard School of Public Health has published a report on this.  It says that more than 30 years ago research indicated that saturated fat (such as in butter) was bad for the heart and people were told to switch to margarine.  A Harvard study of women between 1980 and 1994 found a significant reduction of heart disease risk by reducing smoking, hormone treatment, and dietary improvements including reducing or eliminating saturated fat (such as in butter.)  Further research has shown, however, that some margarines contained trans fat, which was even worse for the heart than saturated fat.  The report cautions us not to make decisions as a result of just one study but to consider the body of recent research about an issue like butter versus margarine. 4. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 Grams- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 7g of saturated fat.  A tablespoon of margarine is 2g of saturated fat. 5.  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other Foods- Unproven! We could not find anything definitive about this. 6.   Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! It depends on what you are measuring.  The advantage of butter is that it is a more natural product than margarine and does have more vitamin content.  But butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk.  Saturated fats are the ones that are solid at room temperature and increase the “bad” cholesterol (LDL) as well as the “good” cholesterol (HDL).  The disadvantage of true margarine is the trans fat level.  The more solid a margarine is at room temperature, the more trans fat it contains, as much as 3 grams per tablespoon.  Margarine makers have responded to that by releasing tub or liquid products that have either reduced or eliminated trans fats.  Watch for the labels.  Heart doctors recommend butter over normal margarine but recommend trans fat free margarines over butter.  It all gets very confusing.  There are even margarine products now that say they actually lower cholesterol. 7. Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods- A Matter of Personal Taste! 8. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for Less than 100 years- Fiction! Margarine was introduced as an inexpensive alternative in France in 1869, according to a history found in the Margarine and Spreads Association in the United Kingdom. 9.   Margarine is high in trans fatty acids- Truth! 10.  Margarine triples the risk of coronary heart disease- Unproven! Although trans fats are to be avoided, we did not find any research that says that the use of margarine triples the risk of heart disease. 11. Margarine ncreases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)- Truth! 12. Increases the risk of cancers up to five fold- Fiction! We could not find any substantiation of this claim. 13. Margarine lowers quality of breast milk- Truth! We didn’t find any research on this but there are studies on how a mother’s eating of trans fats affects the level of trans fats in her milk. One study, for example, comparing Canadian breast milk to Chinese breast milk found that Canadian mothers had 33 more trans fats in their milk than the Chinese mothers.  So the quality of the breast milk can be affected by the consumption of trans fats. 14.  Margarine decreases immune response- Truth! We found several references to this including an article by nutritionist Dr. Mary Enig that said that consuming trans fatty acids “Affects immune response by lowering effeciency of B cell response and increasing proliferation of T cells.” 15. Decreases insulin response- Truth! Actually the trans fat can increase blood insulin levels, which increases the risk for diabetes. 16.  Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC- Fiction! We found no support for this.  Perhaps whoever wrote this heard a discussion about the “plasticity” of margarine.  It is “plastic” at room temperature meaning that the shape of it can be changed when pressure is applied.  That doesn’t mean it is composed of what we normally think of as plastic. It was originally made of animal fats but increasingly now is made from vegetable oils. Updated 3/29/07 ","Household"

"," The use of RFID (radio frequency ID chips) provides easy wireless information from a relatively small and inexpensive device.  Many U.S. shoppers are familiar with the MobilExxon “SpeedPass,” for example.  It is a small key chain device that allows the user to make purchases that are charged to a credit card but without having to carry the credit card or exchange the actual credit card information.  The user merely holds the device near the pump and the information for the transaction is exchanged wirelessly.  Another use of the technology, such as by Benetton and Gillette, is to attach a small inexpensive chip to a product.  According to VigilantTV, Benetton intends to imbed the chips into collars or labels on clothing.  The stated purpose is for inventory and product control.  If it works well, the ease and accuracy of keeping track of product in large stores such as Wal-Mart will be sensational.  Privacy experts, however, fear the implications of the existence of such chips beyond the check-out counter.  The chips need to be within a few feet of a special receiver or reader in order to be useful, but could the receivers be placed in public places and you or information about you be gathered as you went through your day?  To avoid that, the experts say the chips should be disabled in some way at the point of purchase.  Some have said that there could be a booming business in devices that consumers could buy to disable the chips themselves.  Promoters of the technology say it will help companies track product through the manufacturing, shipping, and sales process.

The report in Detroit was in July, 2002 by Steve Wilson of channel 7, the ABC affiliate. He went from store to store to check on prices of a drug that cost the pharmacy $2. Prices ranged up to $100. He says the blood pressure medication Vasotec can cost about $76 per month. The generic version often sells for $60. But he says it costs the pharmacy less than $6. One pharmacist admitted that the mark-up was “unconscionable.” Wilson reports that the widly-used drug Prozac sells for about $100 per month in Detroit.

Prozac was selling for 3,000 to 5,000 percent profit. She compared that with if a grocer who bought an orange for 20-cents would sell it at the same mark-up, the orange would cost $10. She quotes a spokesperson for Walgreens as saying that the pharmacies don’t make much profit on the brand name drugs and need to charge higher profit on the generics, which they can do while still giving the consumer a better deal than the brand name price. She also found that Costco consistently had the best prices with mark-ups between 86 and 423 percent, not 3,000 to 5,000. Philadelphia’s KYW-TV did the same story in November, 2002. KYW’s consumer specialist Paul Moriarty says Rite Aid, Walgreens, Eckerd, and CVS all declined to be interviewed about high mark-ups on generic drugs. He too found that Enalapril, the generic version of Vasotec, selling for $60 at Walgreens and $68 at Eckerd Drugs, even though it costs them about $5, a 1,300 percent mark up. He, too, found Costco to be the cheapest with a cost for Enalapril, for example, of $12.97. He also found lower prices at Wal-Mart and K-Mart, but not as low as Costco. A 3/11/03 article by Wall Street Journal reporter Francesco Fiondella reflected some of the same findings.

"Certain Dryer Softener Sheets can Clog your Lint Filter-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dryer-sheets/"," The eRumor is a first-hand account of a person whose heating unit in a clothes dryer failed. The man who repaired it pulled out what appeared to be a clean lint filter but when taken over to the kitchen sink would not allow water to run through it. It was clogged. The repairman said it was the result of using dryer sheets, that they result in a film that clogs the filter and that can only be removed by scrubbing the filter with a brush as well as soap. "," There appears to be some truth to this one, although not all dryer sheets are the same. We did some checking and found several manufacturers of clothes dryers who discouraged using dryer sheets. The owners manuals for  Eurotech brand tumble dryers say “We recommend using a liquid fabric softener in the washer’s rinse cycle.  We do not recommend using fabric softener sheets in the dryer. Over time, the chemicals on these sheets can build up inside the lint filter and clog the holes that circulate the air.” The Asko Corporation, which makes washers and dryers, publishes a “Dryer Use and Car Guide.” They have the same recommendation against using fabric softener sheets in dryers because of chemical build-up that can clog the filter. Frigidaire in its FAQ about dryers says that not only should the lint screen be cleaned after every load but occasionally washed in soap and water to remove built-up residue from dryer sheets. Dave Harnish of Dave’s Repair Service in New Albany, PA, publishes a newsletter about appliances titled DRSNews. In his 10/18/03 edition, he said “If you use dryer fabric softener sheets, be careful to use only one sheet per load (or two). The chemical used in these sheets can clog lint filters…” He recommends washing them with hot water and soap, scrubbing with a brush. Most of the articles we found said the build-up on the lint filters is because of chemicals used in the dryer sheets. There are some products that claim to reduce static, soften fabric, and do not use chemicals, but we’ve not seen an independent evaluation of those. Doing a search at www.google.com for: dryer sheets “chemical free” will list some of those. . Last updated 2/24/05 ","Household"

"," There is controversy over rBST, which stands for recombinant bovine somatotropin.  It is an artificial growth hormone used in cows. We’ve not found the family of Marissa, the 11-year old girl referenced in the eRumor.  If she is real her family’s suspicions are worthy of consideration but do not constitute proof that what they describe has been caused by ingesting milk from Wal-Mart.  There are other conditions that can cause early menstruation such as hypothyroidism.  Also, although there are fears, there is not scientific agreement about whether rBST is harmful to humans. RBST is a synthetic version of bST or BGH, a natural growth hormone in cows which, among other things, affects the amount of milk produced by a dairy cow.  Use of bST to increase milk production has been around since the 1930’s then along then the synthetic version came into popularity. Critics of the use of rBST say that it is banned for use in cattle in virtually every major country in the world except the United States.  They point out that there is an increase in health problems in cattle that produce the most milk so the use of rBST should be avoided on that ground. Supporters say rBST helps dairy farmers with better milk yield and that there has not been any proof that the hormone causes problems in humans.  It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although this eRumor focused on Wal-Mart milk there are several different milk companies that use cattle treated with rBST and Wal-Mart also sells milk from cows that are not injected with it.  Because of the controversy over rBST a lot of the milk products without it are labeled as such and are not hard to find. In March, 2008, Wal-Mart announced that rBST will no longer be found in milk from either Wal-Mart or Sams Club. Updated 3/25/08 ","Household"

The Vicks company has never made such a claim although Vicks VapoRub and its formula of camphor, eucalyptus oil, and menthol is formulated to deal with coughs.  The company recommends rubbing it on the chest or throat for relieving coughing during a cold or on muscles and joints for relieving minor pain.

The tech website iMore reported that the bending iPhone wasn’t necessarily a surprise because “it’s made out of a generally rigid but deceptively thin metal shell” that can be deformed if too much force is applied. That means carrying your iPhone 6 Plus in your pocket —your back pocket in particular — may leave it forever disfigured. The biggest issues with the bending iPhone 6 Plus are with the LCD screen. Issue like brightness irregularities, dead pixels and color stripping might crop up on the screen, Wired.com reports. Another major issue with the bendy smart phone is that lithium-ion batteries rupture under the stress of repeated bending. If you insist on carrying your iPhone 6 Plus in your pocket, the magazine suggests placing it with its back facing your body and to take it out before sitting down. A video of an iPhone 6 Plus “bend test” is available here . However, Consumer Reports conducted a scientific test that calls into question the extent of the bendy iPhone 6 eRumor.

"," TruthOrFiction.Com was contacted a spokesperson at Kimberly-Clark who gave us an official statement saying that “there is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues.”  The statement also said that such customer complaints are rare but when Kimberly-Clark hears about them they follow up to ensure the safety of their products. Here is their statement : At HUGGIES, nothing is more important than the safety of the little ones who use our products. Families have put their trust in HUGGIES diapers for decades and all of our diapers have been thoroughly tested to ensure they are safe. Our primary interest remains with the wellbeing of the child involved. When we first learned about this report, we immediately reached out to the mom to express our concern and learn as much as we could about what happened. In addition to requesting samples of the diapers used by the mom for testing, we also initiated an internal review. While we have not yet received any samples from this consumer, our internal review has not found any product issues or abnormalities. We understand how deeply moms care about the health of their baby’s skin and we are always troubled by any report of skin irritation. In each and every case, we try to work closely with the moms to learn about their individual situation to ensure that our products can better meet their needs and help inform our ongoing product development. All of our products must pass stringent safety reviews prior to making it to retailer shelf. This review includes the superabsorbent material in question which has been thoroughly evaluated by more than 450 medical and scientific studies and has been used safely for years in our HUGGIES products and across the diaper industry. There is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues. Complaints of this nature are highly unusual – in fact over the past six months the rate is about one for every 40 million diapers sold. We take our responsibility to provide families with products they can use with confidence very seriously, and will continue to do everything we can to understand what occurred and how we can help. Additional Background The Superabsorbent materials (SAM) found in HUGGIES diapers is being used in virtually all disposable diapers on the market today. Superabsorbent materials (SAM), also known as polyacrylate absorbents, are a family of polymers that have extraordinary absorbency — the particles will absorb up to 100 times their weight in moisture. The safety of superabsorbent material has been proven in more than 450 consumer safety tests that have studied every way a person could come in contact with it — through skin contact, ingestion or even inhalation. Each study has consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this material. The crystals in the diaper are forms of a superabsorbent material that’s been used in diapers for many years. The superabsorbent material looks like a tiny bead when it’s dry and looks like a gel when it’s wet (and mixed with the other fluffy fibers in the diaper). Superabsorbent material in diapers offers significant benefits, like drawing wetness away from baby’s skin and helping to keep baby’s skin healthy. In HUGGIES diapers, superabsorbent material is mixed with the fluffy diaper padding. This material turns liquid into a gel, helping to prevent leakage. Occasionally, you may see small beads of gel on the diaper or on your baby, but the gel is nontoxic and not harmful. Posted 11/7/13  Updated 11/13/13 ","Household"

It is true that some of these companies are facing tough times    financially, but not all of them are going out of business.     Bankruptcy sometimes means they are closing their doors.  But    sometimes it also means that they are reorganizing and intend to continue.     Sometimes other companies may purchase them out of bankruptcy. The Wall Street Journal said on April 28, 2008, that bankruptcy laws do    not require companies to redeem gift certificates so a lot of consumers    might end up with worthless cards.  Not all the struggling companies    are handling gift certificates the same way. Let’s go through the list: Hollywood Video Hollywood Video’s parent company, Movie Gallery, announced plans at    the end of 2007 to reorganize through bankruptcy.  As of this writing    Hollywood Video is still operating although a lot of stores have been    closed as a part of the reorganization. Levitz Furniture Levitz is currently in the process of liquidating assets and the only    advice the company has had for holders of gift cards is to file a claim in    bankruptcy court.  Consumers are usually the last in line when bills    are being paid, however. Sharper Image Sharper Image filed bankruptcy in February, 2008, and for a while it    stopped accepting gift cards.  It later began accepting them again    but customers needed to buy something worth double the card’s value and    were required to use the full amount of the card. Performance Team Freight This company is not going bankrupt, does not do retail sales, and does    not issue gift cards!  We don’t know why it was included in this    list.  The company describes itself as providing third party    logistics services to retailers and their vendors. Linens ‘n Things As of this writing, Linen’s ‘n Things has not filed for bankruptcy but    there has been speculation about it because the company deferred an    interest payment to lenders. Circuit City The company has not filed for bankruptcy.  There was talk of    selling the company to Blockbuster, in which case gift cards would still    be usable. The bottom line is that if you hear of a company going bankrupt, contact    that company to find out the status of your gift cards. Updated 4/30/08 ","Household"

ABC-13 in Lynchburg, Virginia conducted a similar test.  Not every car opened with the GM key, but enough did to convince them that the threat was real.  They talked with a locksmith who said that the biggest risk is valuables stored in the car.  Even though the key may open the door, it doesn’t mean the key will work in the ignition, which has more tumblers in the lock. This is apparently not new information both to a lot of car owners who have made the discovery themselves and to thieves who prowl parked cars looking for things to steal.  We even found that sets of GM keys are available on the Internet from sites that boast that the keys will open the majority of GM cars.  Sets of keys are available for Fords as well. The bottom line is to avoid leaving valuables in the car and to make sure you have some kind of an alarm system that would prevent any thief from getting away with a break-in, according to the locksmiths.

On September 29, 2009,   the prepaid cell phone provider Tracfone Wireless, Inc., announced the   launch of SafeLink Wireless in Illinois.  According to a September   29, 2009 Reuters article, SafeLink Wireless is the first and only   completely free offering of Lifeline — a U.S. government supported   program for income eligible households that ensures telephone service is   available and affordable for eligible low-income households. The   TracFone Wireless company is a subsidiary of América Móvil S.A.B. de   C.V. based in Mexico City. The eRumor jokingly   calls this an “Obama phone” but the Reuters article said that the   program was based on   a decision made by the FCC to “enhance its Lifeline program and keep the   right to communicate in pace with technology.”      The concept of providing cellular phones to low income families actually   dates back before the Obama administration.  According to a June 3,   2008  wirelessandmobilenews.com article, TracFone became the “first wireless   provider to be designated by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC)   as an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) for the purpose of   offering Lifeline.” Click for news release. In order to qualify,   families must meet certain criteria and verify income annually.     This program is currently available in Alabama, Connecticut, District of   Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,   Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,   Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.      The company expects to offer the service nation wide soon. Funding for the   Lifeline program is collected in the form of surcharges that are   included in telephone and cellular phone bills. updated 10/26/09 ","Household"
"Foreign toothpaste at U.S. discount stores-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dollar-toothpaste/"," It is a warning that a TV news report said that at “dollar stores,” including Dollar Tree and Greenbacks, name-brand toothpastes were not “the same as from Wal-mart, grocery stores, etc,”  They were manufactured for other countries, which have different standards than in the U.S. "," When one TV station does an innovative investigative report, it often results in numerous stations across the country doing the same thing.  In 2004 there were numerous local investigations by TV stations of discount stores across the country. An example is in May of 2004, NBC 5, which serves Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas, broadcast an investigative report on discount stores. According to the report, tubes of toothpaste were found in local stores that had been manufactured in foreign countries.  They looked like the products that U.S. customers would expect but closer inspection revealed their origins and that some did not have required U.S. labeling.  They quote an expert from the Baylor College of dentistry who said that the biggest concern about the foreign toothpastes was the fluoride levels.  For example, he said, one of the toothpastes from South African had 10 times the fluoride of products normally sold in the U.S.  The report said that toothpastes sold in the United States should have the seal of the American Dental Association on them. We also found similar reports by NBC 4 in Columbus, WROC-TV in Rochester, New York, KXAN 36 in Austin, Texas, and many others.  All of them discovered foreign toothpastes in discount or so called “dollar” stores.

"Best Buy Restock Fee-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/best-buy-refund/"," A message from a consumer complaining that when he returned a GPS that he’d purchased from a Best Buy store, he was charged a 15% restocking fee and would have to wait for a check to be sent to him for his refund.  He complained that he was not told of the return policies when he purchased the item. "," TruthOrFiction.com contacted Best Buy’s corporate office and was told that the 15% restocking fee is accurate. Best Buy told us: “ A 15% restocking fee will be charged on returns or exchanges of any opened notebook computers, projectors, camcorders, digital cameras, radar detectors, GPS/navigation and in-car video systems unless defective or prohibited by law. A restocking fee of 25% will be charged on Special Order Products, including appliances unless defective or prohibited by law. If a returned item is not in new condition or any accessories are missing, the full purchase price will not be refunded or credited. For the benefit of our customers, the above policies are printed at all checkout lanes, the customer service counter and on the backs of purchase receipts.” Refund policies and restocking fees have become the focus of regulatory interest in some states.  In 2005 this led to fines for several retailers from the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).  The DCA fined Express, Staples, and the Sports Authority nearly $100,000 “for refusing customer returns without disclosing the conditions of their return policies.”  Seven other companies, including Best Buy, paid fines for “charging customers ‘restocking fees’ without clear disclosure.” There are many retailers that have restock fees so it’s best to check that ahead of time when making a purchase.

"Water in a microwave can be dangerous-Truth!","2015-03-17 17:52:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/microwavewater/"," The writer of the email says his or her 26 year old son was scalded by water that erupted from a container after being heated in a microwave.  The son experienced severe burns.  The writer warns that water should never be heated by itself in a microwave and quotes a science teacher who says the eruption was because the water was heated in a new container that lacked scratches on the sides to allow bubbles to accumulate and be released.  The email also quotes a doctor who treated the injured son as saying that theses incidents are fairly common. "," This       has been a complex one to try to track down and we’ve consulted a       number of different sources.  Here is our best understanding of       the truth: …As the millions of people who heat water in the microwave for       coffee and tea can attest, this is not a common occurrence and we       could find no record of injuries from it, although that doesn’t mean       none has happened. …When water is heated on a stove and reaches the boiling point,       there are usually the characteristic bubbles that emerge from the       bottom of the heated pan.  It would be easy, then, to think       that all water boils like that when reaching the boiling       point.  The problem is, that’s not always the case. … It is possible to       sometimes heat water beyond the boiling point but without the       bubbles.   Why are there no       bubbles?  When water reaches the boiling point, the water       molecules need to start joining arms with other water molecules in       order to create the bubble of vapor that we see as boiling.  In       order to do that, some molecules need to all meet together at the       same place and at the same time at what is called a “nucleation       site.”   A nucleation site can be a tiny impurity,       another air bubble, even a scratch on the surface of the       container. …So, here’s the scenario:  Some water is heated in the       microwave and both the water and the container are clean enough that       there are no nucleation sites.  The water temperature goes       higher than the boiling point, but without       “boiling.”  Not only that, but because of the way       microwaves work, not all of the water in the cup is the same       temperature.  The water lining the sides of the cup becomes       heated, while some of the water toward the interior of the cup       is cooler.

"Avoid Ultra Clorox Bleach…it’s poisonous-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:37:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ultraclorox/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Avoid “Ultra” Clorox Bleach Because It’s Poisonous and More Dangerous Than Normal Bleach- Fiction! Summary of eRumor There are several versions   of this eRumor.  Some simply say to not buy ultra bleach   because it has poisons in it.  Others have been targeting pet   owners saying that the new Ultra Clorox product is both sodium   hypochlorite AND sodium hydroxide, which is lye.  The eRumor   says the lye has been added to make the bleach work faster but is   difficult to rinse off surfaces so can be toxic to animals.  It   recommends against using the product in areas where animals   live.  It also claims that Ultra Clorox has been “cruelty   tested” with animals.  Some versions go on to recommend   the brands that they feel you should use instead of Ultra Clorox. "," There is no truth to this and the cynical would say that the originators of these emails have not so much been opposed to Ultra Clorox as they have been loyal to whatever products they recommend be used instead. According to the folks at Clorox, the “Ultra Clorox” product is the same bleach, the same formula that Clorox has used for years.  The only difference is that it’s more concentrated so less is needed per load of laundry.  When diluted, it’s virtually the same as the original Clorox bleach. Even ordinary chlorine needs to be used with caution and the labels on the products need to be read and any warnings heeded. Does Ultra Clorox contain sodium hydroxide (lye)?  According to Clorox, yes…and so does every other bleach on the market.  It is generally less than 1 percent of the volume.  Contrary to the claim in the eRumor, sodium hydroxide is not “added” to the chlorine to make it work faster.  It is a natural byproduct of the process of making chlorine, according to Clorox.

"Gel candles are exploding and causing injuries-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gellcandles/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Gel” Candles Can Explode – Fiction! The eRumor: This is a warning from a       person who says his former secretary’s house burned down after a gel       candle exploded.  It says the fire marshal told the lady this       was not the first time it has happened and that the gel candle emits       a gas that can then explode and set the room on fire.  The       story says the fire was so hot it melted the smoke alarm and that       nobody noticed anything wrong until her toilet blew up.  The       email then has a message, apparently from a different person who       forwarded it, saying that a friend of her actually saw the explosion       from a gel candle and suffered burns when she grabbed it, but saved       her home from burning. "," : We have not found a source or validation for this particular story and there are no official reports of gel candles “exploding.”  There were some gel candles pulled off the market in 1998 (see below) because of excessive flame that could be dangerous, but no reports of explosion and, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, no reports of damage or injuries. Some of the description in this email does not seem credible.  Whether a fire melted a smoke alarm or not is not relevant because any hot room fire can melt the typical home smoke alarm.  The alarm is not intended to survive a fire, but to warn of one ahead of time.  Also, it is possible to blow up a toilet by putting something explosive into it, but whether a gas escaping from a candle would accomplish that is questionable. Even if the gas was heavier than air, what would ignite it in the toilet? Gel candles have been in the news, however.  There was a voluntary recall in 1998 of hardened gel candles from GLADE by the S.C. Johnson & Son company, of Racine, Wisconsin.  According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, some of the candles could burn with a flame higher than normal, as much as 3 inches above the container.  At the time the recall was announced, the CPSC said there had not been any reports of damage or injuries. There is at least one recall by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission involving candles with breaking or “exploding” glass, but not in connection with gel candles. That was with regard to a more conventional wax candle. There are numerous warnings around the country from various consumer protection organizations and fire departments about the dangers of using ordinary candles around the house.  The National Fire Protection Association says that during 1997, there were more than 11,000 candle-related fires in the United States, including several fatalities.

"Breast cancer can be caused by underarm antiperspirants-Disputed!","2015-03-16 17:08:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/breastcancer/"," An email claims that the use of antiperspirants is the leading cause of breast cancer.  The theory is that toxins are released by sweat, especially under the arms, and antiperspirants are blocking the release of the toxins, allowing them to build up, and the result is cancer.  It also claims that nearly all breast cancers are in the upper, outside quadrant of the breast, near the armpits. "," According to the American Cancer Society and several other respected medical authorities, the use of antiperspirant does not cause cancer.  Additionally, sweating is not the prime way the body gets rid of toxins, so even if the pores under the arms were clogged, that would not doom the body to an accumulation of cancer-threatening build-ups.   According to the American Cancer Society, the upper, outside quadrant is not the site of “nearly all” of breast cancers, but about half that.
