"Latest Facebook Hack Arises Between Comments on Your Contacts’ Posts-Fiction!","2016-07-29 14:16:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/latest-facebook-hack-arises-comments-contacts-posts/"," Posts about “the latest Facebook hack” warn users that hackers are posting offensive messages or pornography “between the comments” on  contacts’ pages that appear to come from your account. "," While it’s very possible for rogue apps or malware to post offensive comments under your name, we couldn’t find any instances of this so-called “latest Facebook hack” actually happening. The post warns that hackers have been able to post offensive content between the comments on a contact’s post so that it appears to have come from your account. Even worse, the post warns, these offensive comments are impossible for you to see, which “can create hurt and misunderstandings” between you and your contacts. Again, we couldn’t find any examples of that actually happening. It’s impossible for offensive content to be posted “between the comments” unless a rogue app or malware infect your Facebook account. And, while that’s a very real threat, it’s not a “new hack” at all. Malware has been known to post content (including porn and offensive comments) with its victims’ accounts since the beginning of Facebook. Malware also tags its victims contacts in these posts to trick other people into clicking on links that will infect their devices with the same virus. If you notice unauthorized posts or comments coming from your account, immediately click the “V” dropdown icon in the upper right hand corner and remove any friends that have been tagged. Then, delete the post and check your apps to locate the source of malware. Follow these steps to remove any suspicious applications. And, if you find malware installed on your device, run a full scan with an antivirus program using these helpful tips . ","Viruses"

In order to redeem the coupon, customers were directed to an outside, third-party website that asked them to like and share the post on Facebook in order to redeem the $55 coupon. Like most offers that sound too good to be true, however, this one is a scam. Safeway issued a statement on its Facebook page when asked about $55 coupon: Unfortunately, this coupon is fraudulent.

Or, these types of scams can also be used for “like farming,” a scam in which a fake offer for products or services is used to entice people to “like” a page so that it can be sold to third-parties for a profit because of its increased visibility. We’ve investigated many fake coupons for companies like Home Depot , Lowes and Aldi , just to name a few.

"," We weren’t able to find any credible reports of the “Sonia Disowns Rahul” virus, so we’re reporting this one as fiction. Warnings about the Sonia Disowns Rahul video began circulating in early March on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. The “warning,” which has been repeated in different forms, reads: ***WARNING*** Tell all contacts from your list not to accept a video called the “Sonia disowns Rahul”. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on the radio. Fwd this msg to as many as you can. There aren’t any credible reports from radio stations or other media outlets about the so-called virus. The language is suspiciously similar to the “dance of the Pople” false virus warning that was widely circulated in 2015 as well. Click here to read our previous coverage on that one. These false warnings could very well come from another country since they appear to have been written by someone who speaks English as a second language. Also, it’s not clear what it would mean for a virus to “format your mobile,” or exactly what it means to “accept a video.” Given all that, we’re calling this one fiction. ","Viruses"
"Turbo Clean PC Free Download Offer-Virus!","2016-01-26 13:12:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/turbo-clean-pc-free-download-offer/"," A so-called “PC Optimizer” called Turbo Clean PC offers a free download that can supposedly boost the speed of your computer by eliminating errors and helping it to operate cleanly. "," Whether or not Turbo Clean PC can actually help your computer run faster is open for debate, but downloading it can definitely damage your computer, and the “free download” offer is misleading at best. First, Turbo Clean PC downloads are often packaged with harmful malware installers that can harm your computer and encrypt your data. Second, the “free download” will only scan your operating system; you’ll have to pay for the full download to fix any problems. Third, there’s evidence that Turbo Clean PC won’t actually help your computer run faster at all. Let’s take a step back and look at Rainmaker Software Group, Turbo Clean PC’s Delaware-based developer. The company released an earlier PC optimizer called Pro PC Cleaner that has been widely described as adware and malware. Symantec Corporation describes Pro PC Cleaner as “a misleading application (rogue software) designed to display false information, such as claiming your system is infected with malicious threats or other system errors” to get users to buy unneeded software to remove threats that don’t exist. Entering “Pro PC Cleaner” into Google returns nothing but customer complaints and instructions to remove it from computers. That might be why Rainmaker Software Group shifted its focus to a similar application with a different name, Turbo Clean PC. Once you download the free version of Turbo Clean PC, it will scan your operating system and compile a lengthy list of system errors and threats. The blog site Spyware-Techie investigated and found that the list of threats and errors are “misleading and suspicious.” It includes temporary files, folders and register entries that “do not affect your operating system in any way.” But, in order to fix the so-called errors, you’ll be prompted to buy the full version of Turbo Clean PC. Spyware-Technie also notes that Turbo Clean PC is often spread through bundled installers, which pose serious malware threats: Such means of distribution are often used by malware developers to spread their intrusive software; thus, there is a chance that your PC could be already infected with some other malicious program if this questionable application is already operating on your computer. Make sure to check the %APPDATA% folder for any dubious files or folders as this directory is known to be used by malicious software most often. Also, you should analyze your registry system for any questionable keys or values. To avoid such potentially harmful instance, you should avoid all third-party download websites as they are well-known to provide setup files filled with suspicious software. Also, you should always have a professional antimalware tool active on your PC at all times as it can notify you about any suspicious installers or websites in advanced. VirusResearch.org stopped short of saying that Turbo Clean PC does not work at all, or that it will damage your computer if it’s downloaded directly from the developer. The site did, however, note that four reputable anti-virus engines have flagged Turbo Clean PC as a threat. Given all that, we’re going to classify this one as a virus. It’s best to avoid downloading the program all together, but if you already have, click here for instructions on how to uninstall it. ","Viruses"

"," There isn’t a “dance of the pope” virus infecting mobile phones. The rumor started in early 2015 on the WhatsApp messaging app. By mid-April, it was spread to social media sites and was shared millions of times in a post that warned: “URGENT: Tell all contacts from your list not to accept a video called the dance of the Pope. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on the radio. Pass on to as many as you can. It was announced on the radio in USA.” There’s no record of a radio station warning listeners about the virus. There also haven’t been any first-hand accounts from people whose phones were infected with the virus. The eRumor likely started overseas because “dance of the pope” isn’t how Americans speak. The post also says that the warning was “on the radio in USA,” which means whoever wrote it was in a different country. Another version of the eRumor claims that BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) had issued the warning about the “dance of the pope” video. That’s also not true, according to the company’s website . ","Viruses"

"," Update 04/06/14: The latest version of this hoax now warns to be aware of software updates claiming to come from Microsoft for Windows Live.   Microsoft does not send out email notifications when update software are available and will never initiate such a contact with users of their products.

There is no such virus. One of the clues that the eRumor is a hoax is that it borrows language from another classic virus hoax. The reference to CNN, the description that Microsoft has classified it as “the most destructive virus ever,” the contention that it was discovered “yesterday” by McAfee, and the reference to the “Zero Sector” of the hard disc are all wording borrowed from a classic Internet virus hoax about “ A Card for You .” Posted 09/22/11    Updated 04/06/14 ","Viruses"

One of the commonly accepted origins of April Fools day involves the  change of calendars in the 1500’s.   King Charles IX of France adopted the Gregorian calendar which  changed the beginning of the new year to January 1, which is the  reason that the eRumor calls the virus by his name. Many ancient cultures celebrated the new year on April 1, which  closely follows the vernal equinox, the moment the sun crosses  directly over the Earth’s equator on March 20 or 21).

A variety of warnings about Koobface have been circulating on the Internet that have caused a little confusion. Some of the warnings talks about a “Koobface”  or “Koob Face” virus. Others refer to a “Knob Face” virus, which may just be a variation on “Koob face.” The mere exchange of text messages on Facebook will not infect your computer. The 2008 Koob Face virus, however, offered to show you a video. When you clicked the link you were prompted to update your Flash player—and that led you to an infected file. Contrary to the warnings, it did not destroy your computer, but did install it as part of a network of computers that stole legitimate search engine results and redirected them to smaller, less legitimate search sites.

"," Beware!  We encountered several of these cleverly disguised invitations, similar to the sample below.  These invitations have buttons to accept or ignore the invitation but clicking them or any of the links in the email will reroute the computer user to a website that could possibly infect them with a computer virus. The easiest way to check questionable emails is to hover the mouse (without clicking any buttons) over the links in the suspected emails. Looking at the bottom border of the email window, an Internet location in the form of a URL to the website can be seen. If that link does not appear to be from the company sending the email it is a very good indication that it is a redirecting scam. It is a good practice to never click links in unsolicited emails until the computer user is certain that the links are safe. updated 10/19/12 ","Viruses"

A warning has been issued by the United Stated Federal Trade Commission (FTC) saying that the email is not from them. The email says it is from “frauddep@ftc.gov” and includes the FTC’s official seal. It claims that a complaint has been filed against you by a third party who feels that a business deal was not handled properly. This is not the kind of virus that comes in an attachment that you click to activate.  Rather the email has links for you to click, for example if you feel the email or the complaint are invalid and clicking those links is what can activate the virus.  A statement from the FTC says the virus is the type that can monitor the activity on your computer and steal credit card numbers, passwords, etc. A spokesperson for the agency says they’ve received large numbers of calls and emails about the virus and believe it is widespread. This is one of the most successful types of virus infection in 2007. Instead of an email with an infected attachment, which could be blocked by anti-virus software, the email points you to links that accomplish the infection.
