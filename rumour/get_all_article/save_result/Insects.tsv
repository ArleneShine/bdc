"Monsanto Says Genetically Modified Ants Could Replace Honey Bees-Fiction!","2015-06-24 09:16:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/monsanto-says-genetically-modified-ants-could-replace-honey-bees/"," Monsanto plans to replace honeybees that are wiped out by pesticides with genetically modified ants. "," There aren’t any plans to replace honeybees with genetically modified ants. That claim surfaced on the fake news website World News Daily Report and quickly went viral on social media sites. Taken out of context, many believed that fake news report was real: A team of researchers at Monsanto believe they might be on the verge of finding a solution to the mysterious drop in honey-bee populations all over the planet, a threat that endangers the world’s food supply as a whole. The $3 million dollar grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has led the team of researchers at Monsanto to develop alternative strategies to “survive” an eventual honey bee Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a phenomenon that has been increasing in the past decade and that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear, a situation that could “dramatically impact the world’s food supply”, admit experts. “Latest studies have found a link between neonicotinoid pesticides that are vastly used in GE corn crops. As GE farming has become an essential part of agriculture in today’s modern world, we had to develop ways to promote both the continuity of GE farming and the survival of the honey bees, a fascinating challenge” admits John Leere, head biochemist of the project. The team of researchers has developed a genetically modified ant that could “possibly save the world’s food supply.” But World News Daily Report’s disclaimer states that it assumes “all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.” Many readers didn’t read the disclaimer and sounded off on Monsanto’s fictional plans to produce genetically modified ants: Protect the ‘natural’ species we have. Stop the use of indiscriminate pesticides. We are killing them off, lets stop and infest the huge amount of money monsanto are chucking about. To make this a world we actually ‘share.’  Stop with the genetics we’ve destroyed enough wildlife already! But it’s true that bee populations have been dropping due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). That happens when adult worker bees are killed off and a queen bee is left alone in a hive with immature bees, according to USDA’s Agriculture Research Service : Bee pollination is responsible for more than $15 billion in increased crop value each year. About one mouthful in three in our diet directly or indirectly benefits from honeybee pollination. Commercial production of many specialty crops like almonds and other tree nuts, berries, fruits and vegetables depend on pollination by honeybees. These are the foods that give our diet diversity, flavor, and nutrition. Experts have scrambled to understand what is causing Colony Collapse Disorder, and pesticides have been investigated as a cause. Researchers in England actually developed genetically modified olive flies in an effort to solve the problem — but they are intended to replace some pesticides, not honeybees: The idea is to release a large number of GM olive flies that will be used to kill off wild pests that damage the crop. The company responsible for their manufacture and release is Oxitec. They plan to release GM male olive flies that would naturally mate with the females, ultimately resulting in the death of female offspring at the larvae or maggot stage. The thought is that this would lead to a reduction in the olive fly population, which would allow the trees to produce fruit without the need for chemical sprays. So, in the end, reports that Monsanto is developing genetically modified ants to replace honeybees are false. ","Insects"
"Ziploc Bags Full of Pennies and Water Keep Flies Away- Fiction!","2015-06-11 10:57:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ziploc-bags-full-of-pennies-and-water-keep-flies-away/"," Ziploc bags filled with water and pennies can be used to keep flies away. "," Ziploc bags full of water and pennies don’t act as a homemade fly repellent. This rumor has been circling the web for years, and people have been using it to scare away flies for even longer. The idea is that flies have poor eyesight, and water-filled bags create some type of optical illusion that scares them away. The most common version claims that light refracted in the water confuses the flies. Another version claims that flies are scared by their own oversized reflections in the bags. First, the claim that flies have poor eyesight is false . Their eyes are made up of thousands of individual lenses that can see polarized light and color spectrums that human eyes can’t: “House fly eyes can recognize even the slightest movements in a wide field. This allows the fly to see a far wider range, as well as detect and react to movement at a quicker pace than species with simple eyes. This is the reason that it is extremely difficult to swat a house fly.” That doesn’t mean all of those lenses don’t haywire when a fly looks into a bag of water, but experts say that it’s unlikely. A bug expert with the Audubon Institute told the New Orleans Times–Picayune he had experimented with the water bag trick, and it didn’t work: “(The bug expert) points out that flies are seasonal, they’re affected by wind, rain and other factors. There are lots of reasons people might come to believe the folksy water bags scare them off, but in his scholarly view, those reasons don’t, well, hold water.” The TV show “MythBusters” also experimented with the homemade flytrap and reported it to be a bust: “The Build Team made a rig consisting of three chambers separated by trap doors. The first chamber would hold the flies, the second would hold some rotten meat, and the third would hold both rotten meat and a bag of water. They then released over 5,000 flies from the first chamber and waited to see how many flies would go into each of the other two. After the chambers were sealed off, they let all the flies die and collected the corpses to weigh for comparison. The chambers with and without the water contained 35 and 20 grams of flies, respectively, busting the myth.” ","Insects"
"Camel spiders in the gulf-Truth!","2015-03-18 18:06:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/camelspider/"," Photo of a gigantic spider allegedly caught by military members serving in Iraq. "," We haven’t tracked down exactly who took this picture or when and where, but the chances are good that it’s authentic. Camel spiders are real, are large, and are in the Middle East including Iraq. They don’t get as big as a man’s leg, however, as appears in this picture. The photo, if authentic, was taken at close range as is indicated by the hand and cuff of the soldier that are visible in the upper right. Also, it appears to be a picture of two spiders. Some pictures of camel spiders first came from soldiers headed for Iraq but who encountered them in Kuwait. There are some urban legends about camel spiders that claim they scream when they run, that they can run as fast as 25 miles-per-hour, and that they climb onto the undersides of camels and eat their stomachs. According to the experts we’ve consulted, they do not make any noise, they do run very fast but not 25 miles-per-hour, they are primarily nocturnal, they do not eat camel stomachs, and their bite can sting or produce numbness, but is not lethal.

"The man-eating snake-Unproven!","2015-03-17 22:02:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/snake/"," This eRumor comes in several versions.  All of them include pictures of a large snake that has obviously swallowed a very large meal.  Then there are pictures of a human body apparently being cut from the belly of the snake.  The differences among the versions are the location and explanation of the stories behind the pictures. "," TruthOrFiction.com is interested in tracking down the actual information about the pictures, but the consensus of the reptile experts that we have either talked with or discovered on the Internet is that the pictures are not what they are represented to be. The pictures of the engorged snake, for example, are more likely the aftermath of the snake having killed and eaten an animal.  The angular shape seems to be of some kind of four-legged creature rather than the form of a human. There are a few stories of large snakes killing humans, but not many of them swallowing humans.  The main reason, according to snake experts, is that snakes begin swallowing their prey at the head and with humans, the snake is confronted with a major obstacle when it gets to the shoulders.  Snakes can ingest remarkably large creatures, but need a more gradual contour to do it. The snake in the pictures is variously described in the eRumors as a boa constrictor, anaconda, or a python.  The experts say it is a reticulated python. The pictures of the man or boy appear to be from a different incident and a different snake and, according to experts, were apparently staged.  They point out that the body is not in the kind of condition that would be true if it had been inside of a living snake.  There victim would be more covered in slime.  Also, the snake’s entrails seem to be missing and were probably already removed prior to the entry of the body.   Additionally, some pictures show that whoever was brave enough to stick his head inside the carcass may have had the help of a plastic bag over his head.  Finally, if this person had been swallowed by a snake, he would have been swallowed head-first and his arms would be at his side. As for the location and the stories, TruthOrFiction.com has received several versions: …That a crew member on a land oil rig in Amazonas was captured by the snake as he took a nap. …A man in India was captured by a python as he napped by a roadside. …The victim is one of three men in Brazil who were sleeping when attacked by an anaconda. …That the victim was a crew member on an oil rig in Nouakchott, the capitol of Mauritania, West Africa. …That the victim was in Indonesia. …That the victim was in Ecuador. …That the victim was in Peru. …That the victim was in Borneo. …That the victim was in Singapore. …That the victim was in Venezuela ","Insects"

"Warning about Formosan Termites-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:57","https://www.truthorfiction.com/formosan-termites/"," The forwarded email warns that mulch showing up in your local home improvement store could include Formosan termites.  The reason is that trees that were blown over during the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast are being turned into mulch and given to anyone who will haul it away.  New Orleans is one of the places in the country for Formosan termites established a foothold–so buyers beware. "," There is widespread and legitimate concern in Louisiana and other parts of the South about the destructive Formosan subterranean termite, but not because of mulch made from downed trees from New Orleans.  The local governments are not “trying to get rid of tons and tons of this mulch to any state or company who will come and haul it away.”  The Louisiana Department of Agriculture has established a quarantine that prohibits taking any goods or materials damaged by the hurricanes out of the 12-parish area of New Orleans.  That includes all wood waste, such as fallen trees, whether the trees are intact or have been chipped into bits and pieces. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Formosan subterranean termite is one of the most destructive termite species in the world.  It takes only one king and queen to produce an enormous colony.  A mature colony can include millions of termites and can produce 3,000 new termites per day.  The USDA says it is believed that the pests came into the U.S. from Taiwan aboard ships during World War II.  The University of Florida says that the first recorded infestation of Formosan termites was in 1957 in Charleston, South Carolina.  Within a few years colonies were found in Galveston and Houston, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana.  The USDA estimates that in New Orleans alone the Formosan termites infest 30 percent of the trees. The Formosan termites are weak fliers so they do not naturally move long distances.  They spread to other areas primarily through being transported in infected wood.  In Louisiana authorities believe the prime method of spreading the termite has been through infested railroad ties such as is used for landscaping.  Louisiana is also monitoring or restricting the movement of telephone poles and other large timber. Dr. Matthew Messenger of Dow AgroSciences confirmed for TruthOrFiction.com that most of the trees in New Orleans are being run through chippers and either being burned or dumped into landfills.  Also, he says that the termites are soft-bodied, including the queen, and would probably not survive the chipping process. He adds that the only case he’s heard of where termites were found in mulch at a retail store was when the bags were left on the ground long enough that the termites infested them directly, not because they were from any trees that were used to make the mulch. TruthOrFiction.com also talked with with of the top experts on Formosan termites, Dr. Afhok Raina, Supervisory Research Entomologist, for the Formosan Termite Research Unit of the USDA.  He said that the chances are poor of any live termites from New Orleans ending up in bags of mulch going to other parts of the country.  He said that to begin with almost all of the damaged trees were underwater, which would have killed the termites.  He, too, said that the termites are not likely to have survived the chipping process and adds that if any live termites did end up in a bag of commercial mulch, they would not survive the heat that results from being sealed in a plastic bag especially if exposed to sunlight.  Dr. Raina said that there are concerns about termites in mulch, but that applies to mulch that already exists in a particular location and can easily become infested with local termites.  He says that he does not recommend that homeowners put mulch very close to their homes.  Pest control professionals will frequently establish a chemical barrier around the home to keep termites out.  He says that mulch can compromise that barrier and become the bridge for termites to regain access. One of the retail stores mentioned in the eRumor is Home Depot. TruthOrFiction.com contacted their corporate offices and was told that Home Depot does not sell mulch from any termite-infested trees and does not use any mulch suppliers from the New Orleans area.  The Mulch and Soil Council  (MSC) has established standards that are based on criteria for mulch and soil certification and inspection.  Home Depot requires that all mulch suppliers be certified by the MSC.

CLICK HERE for a site that has hundreds of stories from, and pictures of, alleged brown reclusive bites. Brown recluse spiders are primarily found in the Southern United States and portions of the Midwest.  According to the Department of Entomology at the University of California at Riverside, bites from the brown recluse spider are relatively rare and most people who are bitten do not develop nasty symptoms. The pictures of reported spider bites commonly show a “slow healing necrotic lesion.” Experts warn, however, that not every case of gruesome pictures may be from a reclusive spider bite. There has been a lot of publicity, especially on the Internet, about the effects of the bite of the brown reclusive spider but doctors caution that an injury should not be classed as a spider bite unless the spider has been seen doing the biting.  In Canada, for example, there have been several cases reported of brown reclusive spider bites even though there are no brown reclusive spiders that live that far north. Robert G. Bennett and Richard S.Vetter are professional entomologists. In an article in Canadian Family Physician magazine in August, 2004, they said that 80 percent of spider-bite diagnoses are in error and that when someone gets a necrotic lesion, it is easy to think it might be from a spider.  In reality, according the article, many of the wounds are from other kinds of infections and could even be the result of cancer, which would be important to diagnose correctly.
