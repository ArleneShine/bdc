"Planned Parenthood Sells Body Parts for Profit-Disputed!","2015-07-23 07:52:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/planned-parenthood-sells-body-parts-for-profit/"," An undercover Planned Parenthood video claims that the group sells fetal body parts from partial birth abortions for profit. "," An undercover Planned Parenthood video that claims the group sells body parts from abortions for profit has been disputed. Planned Parenthood said patients who seek abortions can elect to “donate tissue to scientific research.” But the organization disputes that it, or its patients, profits from those donations. The controversy started when and anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress posted an undercover video on YouTube. The video reportedly showed Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood, discussing the sale of fetal tissue and body parts with so-called “potential buyers.” One excerpt from the video — which had nearly 2 million views within days of being posted — captures a conversation between Nucatola and the two people posing as buyers over lunch: Nucatola: Every provider has had patients who want to donate their tissue, and they absolutely want to accommodate them. The just want to do it in a way that is not perceived as, “this clinic is selling tissue, this clinic is making money off of this.” Buyers: Okay, so, when you are, or the affiliate is, determining what that monetary… Nucatola: Yes Buyers: So that it doesn’t raise any question of this is what it’s about, this is the main — what price range would … Nucatola: You know, I would throw a number out, I would say it’s probably anywhere from $30 to $100, depending on the facility and what’s involved. Planned Parenthood responded with a statement that said it follows all state and federal laws related to tissue donations, and that it does not profit from them: In health care, patients sometimes want to donate tissue to scientific research that can help lead to medical breakthroughs, such as treatments and cures for serious diseases. Women at Planned Parenthood who have abortions are no different. At several of our health centers, we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research, and we do this just like every other high-quality health care provider does — with full, appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards. There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or for Planned Parenthood. In some instances, actual costs, such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers, are reimbursed, which is standard across the medical field. The Center for Medical Progress responded that Planned Parenthood had made “key admissions” in its response: Planned Parenthood makes two key admissions in their statement today: 1) aborted fetal parts are harvested at their clinics, and 2) money is exchanged in connection with this. They also tell several lies: 1) That proper consent is obtained from patients, 2) That Planned Parenthood does not make money off the body parts, and 3) that everything is legal. The Center for Medical Progress also released a flier from StemExpress, a California-based biomedical company that (the video claims) purchases fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. The flier discusses the possibility of financial gain for clinics: StemExpress promotes global biomedical research while also providing a financial benefit to your clinic. By partnering with StemExpress, not only are you offering a way for your clients to participate in the unique opportunity to facilities life-saving research, but you will also be contributing to the fiscal growth of your own clinic. The stem cell rich blood and raw materials that are usually discarded during obstetrical procedures can, instead, be expedited through StemExpress to research laboratories with complete professionalism and source anonymity. Nucatola referenced conversations with StemExpress in the video, but she implied that there wasn’t an agreement between the groups in place at the time. Then, in a prepared statement to The Hill , Planned Parenthood said Nucatola was not discussing the sale of body parts and that reimbursements for donated tissue costs were not uncommon: “Deborah Nucatela was speculating on the range of reimbursement that patients can receive after stating they wish to donate any tissue after a procedure,” the organization wrote in a report prepared by its PR firm. “The promotional video mischaracterizing Planned Parenthood’s mission and services is made by a long time anti-abortion activist that has used deceptive and unethical video editing, and that has created a fake medical website as well as a fake human tissue website that purports to provide services to stem cell researchers,” the group wrote in a two-page statement. It also provided several pages of background research about the organization’s use of donated fetal tissue, which it describes as “humanitarian undertaking that hold the potential to cure disease, save lives, and ameliorate suffering.” Planned Parenthood and other critics of the undercover video have argued that it was a carefully edited attack by an anti-abortion group. The Center for Medical Progress (not the same as the Center for Medical Progress at the Manhattan Institute ) has a minimal online footprint, so little is known about the group. But David Daleiden, the group’s self-identified founder , has been a long time anti-abortion activist. In 2009, Daleiden posted another video in which he suggested during a Q&A session that Planned Parenthood had “an institutional tolerance for adult-child sexual relationships,” the Daily Beast reports . So, it’s true that Planned Parenthood donates fetal tissue to medical research. But the claim that Planned Parenthood does so illegally, or profits from it, are disputed. ","Medical"
"Puerto Ricans Get Disability Because They Don’t Speak English-Truth!","2015-04-17 13:05:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/puerto-ricans-get-disability-because-they-dont-speak-english/"," Puerto Ricans who don’t speak English receive disability benefits. "," It’s true that some Puerto Ricans have received disability benefits because they don’t speak English. A report released by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that 218 Puerto Ricans had received disability benefits from 2011 to 2013 because they didn’t speak English. That angered many people because Puerto Rico is a predominately Spanish-speaking country, even though both English and Spanish are listed as its official languages . The Social Security Administration has medical-vocational guidelines that assume people who can’t read or write in English have limited ability to find a job in the U.S., making them eligible for disability benefits. The problem is that these guidelines — or grid rules — also apply to Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory) even though most people in the country speak Spanish, according to the report : “A claimant asserting an inability to read, write, or communicate in English may increase his/her likelihood of receiving disability benefits under the English-language grid rules in Puerto Rico when the claimant’s residual functional capacity and other vocational factors line up under grid rules. In attempting to determine the number of cases associated with the English-language grid rules, we found the agency lacked complete data to determine how often adjudicators in Puerto Rico used these grid rules since policy required DDS staff report on only a portion of the cases where these grid rules were relevant.” The report said that the Social Security Administration would change its rules so that “factors that may affect a claimant’s ability to adjust to other work in the economy” could be considered.

"Amish Cure for Hearing Loss – Fiction!","2015-04-07 17:11:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/amish-cure-for-hearing-loss/"," The Amish have found a natural way to cure hearing loss. "," The Amish haven’t developed a secret formula to cure hearing loss. Claims about the so-called Amish miracle cure for hearing loss can be traced back to websites that focus on holistic healing. Most of the websites claim that herbal supplements (which they happen to sell) can cure hearing loss. Other sites, like this one , sell books on how to improve your hearing naturally. There’s no scientific proof that herbal supplements can be used to cure hearing loss. The Mayo Clinic says that the known treatment options for hearing loss are: removing wax blockage, surgical procedures, hearing aids and Cochlear implants. But there is hope for a cure. Most noise-induced hearing loss comes from damaged cells and nerves in the inner ear. The Hearing Health Foundation said that chickens are able to regenerate these cells, and that could be a good sign for humans: “The key to restoring hearing in humans is to regenerate cells deep within the inner ear. In fact, most types of hearing loss in humans results from damage to these cells, called hair cells. “While humans cannot regenerate hair cells in the inner ear after they are damaged, chickens can. In fact, most animals other than mammals can regenerate these delicate cells, restoring their hearing spontaneously after damage. Our goal is to translate this to humans.” Still, there aren’t any known herbal cures (Amish or otherwise) for hearing loss. Be wary of any product or company that makes that claim. ","Medical"
"Chaplain Says Officials Ordered Him To Cover Christian Symbols In VA Chapel-Truth!","2015-03-30 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/va-covers-religious-symbols/"," The Veterans Administration (VA) ordered that Christian symbols and statutes in a chapel at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, be covered when the chapel was not being used for Christian services. "," It’s true that Christian symbols were once covered by a curtain when Christian services were not being held in the chapel at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC, but that policy is no longer in place. The story went viral in the spring of 2014 after a number of news outlets reported that the VA facility in Iron Mountain was not in compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that requires houses of worship to be nonsectarian. The story went viral again in early 2015, so TruthorFiction.com followed up with staff at the Oscar G. Johnson VAMC for an update. Bradley Nelson, the public affairs director at the facility, told TruthorFiction.com that the curtain was temporarily used to meet requirements outlined in the VA’s Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures that were issued in 2008. The policy states that the VA must “uphold the free exercise of religion by all medical, domiciliary, and nursing home patients in the health care facility.” “In keeping with this, it has been long standing policy that VA chapels not reflect any one denomination or faith when not being used for specific faith services or activities,” Nelson said. “This allows for our patients and their families who do not identify with the Christian faith to use the room for prayer, meditation or reflection according to their faith tradition. We were coming into compliance with this policy last spring and the person responsible for the Chapel thought the curtain would be the easiest way to do this, i.e., open it for chapel services and close it when not being used. Based on constructive feedback and what other VA medical centers have done, the curtains were taken down.” But VA medical facilities must still comply with the Spiritual and Pastoral Care Procedures. Today, Christian symbols are allowed in the main chapel while Protestant and Catholic services are being held, as well as 24/7 in the Holy Sacrament room located inside the chapel, Nelson said. “We have the smaller Holy Sacrament Room, which is dedicated solely to Christian worship and includes the crucifix, statues of Jesus and Mary, Stations of the Cross, Holy Water, stained glass windows, and other accoutrements found in churches, all of which remain in place 24/7,” Nelson said. “The room is available for anyone wishing to use it.” And there aren’t any specific directives that prohibit the use of scripture or religious items like the crucifix and statues of Jesus and Mary during worship services in the main chapel — but they can’t remain there 24/7. “These religious items are put away between chapel services, however, they are accessible for any group or individual wishing to use them in the chapel for their own prayer, meditation or worship,” Nelson said. Several versions of the Holy Bible and Catholic Rosaries are also available in the chapel. Nelson also provided a number of photos of the Oscar G.

"Kerosene Cures Cancer-Fiction!","2015-03-19 17:20:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/kerosene-cures-cancer/"," Kerosene can be used to cure cancer and other blood diseases. "," There’s no proof that kerosene kills cancer cells, but there’s plenty of proof that it can kill humans. This eRumor surfaced a number of years ago. A report by a person identified as Caro Huptn, the editor of the newspaper TAGO, claimed that a woman had cured more than 20,000 patients with kerosene. It has appeared on many alternative medicine websites, often with a disclaimer like this one: “The following report was given to us by a woman from Michigan. Nothing has been done to verify the information as it sounds quite unusual compared with the knowledge we already have that benefits the cancer patient. It is being printed only to pass on information that arrives at the FACT office, and possibly, for someone doing research to conduct a project to validate or negate the information. If the research is undertaken, we would appreciate receiving the report.” Outside of that one report about kerosene and cancer, there is no record of anyone named Caro Huptn, or the newspaper TAGO, on the Internet. But there has been plenty of research done on how kerosene affects humans, and it’s not good. In 2010, a group of researchers looked at the impact medicinal kerosene had on people in developing countries. The researches looked at cases where kerosene had been used to treat hemorrhoids, but its effect on people who used it to treat cancer would be the same. According to the study : “Kerosene and other petroleum oils were used as the drugs of choice for many medical problems in the past years. The most common use of kerosene was antiseptic aid for cuts and scrapes. Daily applications of kerosene were also used to treat head lice, athlete’s foot, animal problems including cracked or infected hooves, and worm infections… “Nowadays, it is obvious that kerosene chemical-based components are toxic materials for the human body. These materials were found to cause significant direct and indirect dangerous effects on health through inhalation, ingestion, injection, or local dermal contacts. These negative effects may lead to losing the functions of organs of body or lead to long-term disabilities. Although training and increasing of public awareness about these side effects may prevent self-therapy of kerosene, early diagnosis of these side effects can help in the results of care.” That means that even if kerosene could kill cancer cells, it would likely kill the patient along with those cells.

"," The surgery cited in this story did take place, but the accounts of what actually happened are hotly disputed. Photo by Michael Clancy Dr. Joseph Bruner at Vanderbilt is known for his work in fetal surgery, especially on babies with spina bifida, a condition in which the spine does not close properly during development. Vanderbilt confirms that little Samuel Armus was 21 weeks-old in the womb when this surgery took place in 1999, which made the surgery very risky because if anything went wrong, the baby wouldn’t survive on its own.  Dr. Bruner and his colleagues, however, had done numerous successful spina bifida surgeries on fetuses that are not yet viable. In this particular surgery, photographer Michael Clancy was in the operating room to document surgery on such a young fetus. Clancy said that “out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one’s hands were near it. It was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor’s finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist.” The picture became a sensation as a forwarded email especially among opponents of abortion.  The surgeon, Dr. Bruner, told USA Today in 2000 that the picture was being treated like an urban legend and that he’d even received a report that a team of medical experts had called it a hoax.  Bruner confirmed that the surgery and the photo were real but said that it was “not true” that the baby reached out of the womb and grabbed his hand, as some of the forwarded emails alleged.  “ Samuel and his mother, Julie, were under anesthesia and could not move,” he said.  “The baby did not reach out. The baby was anesthetized. The baby was not aware of what was going on.” Michael Clancy, who owns the copyright to the photo, was stunned by Bruner’s comments and maintains that they do not fit what he saw happen during the surgery and when he took his pictures. On his website at www.michaelclancy.com , Clancy said he knows what he saw and also quoted a nurse at Vanderbilt who told him that she’d seen babies do that “all the time.” The surgery was successful and little Samuel Armas was born on December 2, 1999.

"Postal Service stamp helps fund breast cancer research-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/uspscancer/"," You are encouraged to go to the Post Office and purchase “Fund the Cure” stamps that will be benefiting research on breast cancer. "," This is true. The postal stamp for fighting breast cancer was the nation’s first fund-raising stamp, according to the U.S. Postal Service.  It was issued in 1999.  The U.S.P.S. announced in 2002 that the cost of the stamp was being raised from 40-cents to 45-cents and that the stamp would be on sale until at least December, 2003. This is what the U.S.P.S. calls a “semipostal stamp,” meaning that it is priced above the normal cost of First-Class postage with the net proceeds going to a worthy cause.  In the case of the breast cancer stamp, 30 percent of the net proceeds goes to the Medical Research program of the Department of Defense (for breast cancer research).  Seventy percent goes to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

"Toxic tampons-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tampons/"," This email is a warning to women and the writer urges that you send it to “every woman you know.”  It claims that U.S. tampon manufacturers are creating a larger market for their product by adding asbestos to the tampons which creates heavier menstrual flow.  It also claims that there are cases of toxic shock syndrome occurring because of chlorine contamination from the manufacturing process. "," The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the safety of tampons, says there is no truth to the allegation that tampons made in the United States have asbestos in them.  The FDA says it knows of no reports of tampons tainted with asbestos.  Regarding the Rayon and dioxin concerns, the FDA says that’s old news.  U.S. tampons are made of cotton, Rayon or blends of both, according to the FDA.  Rayon comes from a process from wood pulp and there was a time when a bleaching process used on the wood pulp which, according to the FDA, “…was a potential source of trace amounts of dioxin…” but that process is no longer used.  Further, the FDA says that sophisticated testing shows that dioxin levels are at or below the detectable limit.  Additionally, Dr. Stephanie Baker, one of the names listed as having originated the email, says her name has been attached by a hoaxster and that she regards the email as false and had nothing to do with it.   The bottom line is that if you have any concerns about the safety of tampons, this email is not the document on which to base them. Additionally, we contacted Dr. Stephanie Baker and she sent us the following email: I am Stephanie Baker.

"The Generous Gift of a Glass of Milk that Ended up Paying for Medical Care-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/oneglassofmilk/"," A boy from a poor family who was a door-to-door salesman ran out of money.  He was hungry and decided to ask for food from the next person who answered the door.  He ended up merely asking for a glass of water, however, and the woman he asked brought him a glass of milk instead.  Many years later, the poor boy was now a famous physician named Dr. Howard Kelly and the woman who gave him the glass of milk was seriously ill.  He gave himself to her care, she recovered, and when the bill was presented, Dr. Kelly wrote, “Paid in full with one glass of milk.” "," As is often the case, someone has fictionalized the details of this story and gotten some of it wrong, but it is essentially a true event. Dr. Howard Kelly was a distinguished physician who, in 1895, founded the Johns Hopkins Division of Gynecologic Oncology at Johns Hopkins University.  According to Dr. Kelly’s biographer, Audrey Davis, the doctor was on a walking trip through Northern Pennsylvania one spring day when we stopped by a farm house for a drink of water.  A little girl answered his knock at the door and instead of water, brought him a glass of fresh milk.  He visited with her briefly, then went his way.  Sometime after that, the little girl came to him as a patient and needed surgery.  After the surgery, the bill was brought to her room and on it were the words, “Paid in full with one glass of milk.” Our thanks to Andrew Harrison, the Processing Archivist and Fine Arts Coordinator for the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, for help with this story.

"Parasites infesting the breast from new bras-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/infestedbreast/"," This one is accompanied by both a photograph and a video of what is said to be parasites infesting a woman’s breast and creating a grotesque site.  The story warns that women should be sure and wash a new bra to make sure any parasites have been eliminated.  It also recommends ironing underwear for the same reason.  It tells the story of an anthropologist named Susan McKinley who returned from a trip to South America with a rash that evolved into a worm-infested breast. "," We’ve not found anything to substantiate the Susan McKinley story or the photograph of the alleged larvae in a female breast. There is no alarm being spread by doctors about getting worms from new and unwashed bras.  The picture accompanying the eRumor is a fabrication.  It combines a picture of a woman’s breast with a picture of what has been identified as flower seeds.  A flower expert suggested to TruthOrFiction.com that it was the pod of a water lotus. The video that comes with some versions of the eRumor, however, is real but has nothing to do with either the story told in the eRumor or the photograph. The eRumor circulated for more than two years before the video started appearing attached to it.  The video shows a close-up of a medical worker using tweezers to remove worms from a woman’s breast. It is from a case reported from Africa in which Nigerian woman has what is called “cutaneous myiasis” of the breast due to an infestation by the larva of the Tumbu fly.  The medical report says it is the only reported instance of the infestation so there is no need for spreading an alarm.  It is interesting, if not coincidental, to note that the woman who had the infestation was described as spreading her washed clothes outside for drying and not ironing them before wearing them.  The eRumor makes reference to that as well and it brings up the question of whether the warning was initiated by someone who knew of the lone case. Some more recent versions of the story also include pictures of a couple of white worms that it says are the type that are infesting the breast.  As is clear on the picture, however, it was taken by Michael Bohne of the U.S. Forestry service and is of the larva of the Asian longhorned beetle.  It has nothing to do with any of the other stories.

"Hobby Lobby is Suing the U.S. Government Over Obamacare-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hobby-lobby-lawsuit/"," This is a forwarded email that contains a letter allegedly written by David Green, the owner of Hobby Lobby.  The letter says that his company is run on Christian principles and that he feels that it is wrong to be federally ordered to enroll his employees in a government mandated healthcare program that provides abortion-causing drugs. "," Update 7/2/14 – The Supreme Court made a ruling on June 30, 2014 that “certain ‘closely held’ for-profit businesses can cite religious objections in order to opt out of a requirement in ObamaCare to provide free contraceptive coverage for their employees.” This according to a June 30, 2014 article by Fox News, which said that the Supreme Court justices ruled 5-4 in favor of Hobby Lobby and one other company, after legal teams argued that a 1993 federal law on religious freedom, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , applied also to business. Original findings of eRumor: We have not been able to confirm that this letter was written by David Green but according a September 12, 2012 article by Reuters , the Hobby Lobby Company is suing the U.S. Government over the healthcare mandate. TruthOrFiction.Com has made inquiries as to this letter’s origin and will update this page when we get further findings. The Reuters article said that a lawsuit was filed in District Court in the Western District of Oklahoma “seeks a permanent injunction against the government on behalf of Hobby Lobby and other companies that have religious convictions against abortion.” Green, the CEO and founder of the Oklahoma City based Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., told reporters, “These abortion-causing drugs go against our faith. We simply cannot abandon our religious beliefs to comply with this mandate.” The article also said that there is a January 1, 2013 deadline for the company to comply with the mandate.  A lawyer representing the company told reporters that failure to comply could result in stiff fines. On December 20, 2012 the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Hobby Lobby citing the lack of proof “the rule would ‘substantially burden’ its religious freedom.” One week later, on December 26, 2012 the Supreme Court denied the “request by Hobby Lobby to shield the company from the so-called contraceptive mandate while its legal battle plays out, after a federal court last week similarly ruled against the Christian-owned company.”  This according to a article on the same day by Fox News . On July 19, 2013 “ Hobby Lobby Inc. was given a temporary exemption Friday from a requirement in the new federal health care law to offer insurance coverage for the morning-after pill and similar emergency birth control methods or face steep fines.”   This according to a Fox News article dated that day.   The article said the the judge gave the federal government until October 1 to “ consider filing an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.” Posted 12/26/12 updated 07/02/14 ","Medical"
"Various emails about the proposed Health Care Bill – Truth! Fiction! & Disputed!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/health-plan/"," Several emails circulating about the Obama administration’s proposed Universal Health Care bill.   One concern is that the passage of this bill will levy an additional capital gains tax on the sales of homes of 3.8%. "," Many eRumors and opinions are still circulating about the Health Care Reform Bill or HR-3200 which was abandoned for a new bill 1990 page bill HR-3962 titled the  “Affordable Health Care for America Act.” On December 24, 2009 the Senate passed the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” by a yea-nay vote of 60-39.  The House version of the 2409 page bill is HR-3590.  On the afternoon of March 18, 2010 Congress announced that the House posted an additional package, HR-4872 – Reconciliation Act of 2010, that contains 153 pages of fixes to the Healthcare bill.   On March 21, 2010, Congress passed the two bills. In November 2010 the Republican Party won majority control of Congress on the campaign promise that they would repeal Obamacare.  The new GOP led Congress met on January 19, 2011 to debate the repeal of the Health Care Reform Law.  They voted 245 to 189 in favor to repeal the bill.    The next step for the bill is to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has vowed to block it.  The text of HR-2 – Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act  can be found at this link: Click for HR-2 The current Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act HR-3590 and the Reconciliation Act of 2010HR-4872 can be viewed on the Thomas Library site: Click for HR-3590 Click for HR-4872 On October 1, 2013 the Affordable Care Act roll out began with the opening of the long awaited sign up website at HealthCare.gov . The roll out was shaky after a series of website crashes as people tried to investigate their health care options. A short time later letters from insurance companies began to be sent to nearly 5 million people living in the U.S. notifying them of policy terminations because of new regulations set down by the Affordable care act. When people called the insurance companies they were directed to purchase new policies. TruthOrFiction.Com has a special report. Click here for report. HR-3590 eRumors: Medical devices sold will now have a  2.3% Excise Tax- Truth! According to the Internal Revenue Service , “section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by the manufacturer or importer of the device.”  This is a 2.3 % of the sale price of taxable medical devices and went into effect January 1, 2013.   Some items are exempt from the tax, such as eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids.   According to the Internal Revenue Service, it is the manufacturer or importer of the taxable medical device who is responsible for paying the excise tax, not the consumer.  Customers should not see any added taxes on their sales slips but the cost of the actual item to customers could increase as a result of this excise tax. Some versions of this rumor include a photo of a sales slip from a sporting goods chain and allege that the tax is included on sporting equipment.   The tax is not applicable on anything other than the medical devices. Real estate sales will be taxed 3.8%- Mostly Truth! Congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois released a statement on March 21, 2010  on HR-3590 saying that the health care bill will increase taxes “by imposing a new 3.8% tax on capital gains.” At first, it was believed that taxes and surcharges could be imposed on income over $250,000 for single tax filers and $500,000 for married couples filing together.  That imposed tax is to help fund the $210 Billion needed to fund the new Health Care Bill. According to the National Board of Realtors, the new law will take effect January 1, 2013 and  “may impose a 3.8% tax on some (but not all) income from interest, dividends, rents (less expenses) and capital gains (less capital losses).”   It said that this “tax will fall only on individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) above $200,000 and couples filing a joint return with more than $250,000 AGI.” To help realtors and investors the National Association of Realtors released a brochure that explains the new tax called, The 3.8% Tax Real Estate Scenarios & Examples Effective January 1, 2013. Click here for a copy of the brochure . The actual tax increases may be generated by the HR-4872 Reconciliation Act according a March 21, 2010 article by Life and Health News Insurance News. This is also confirmed in a March 25, 2010 article by CNNMoney.com that said, “couples making $500,000 in wages will pay an additional $2,250. If they made $1 million, they would pay an additional $6,750.  In addition, high-income households would also be subject to a new 3.8% Medicare tax on investment income starting in 2013.” Aspirin Tax become effective June 1, 2013- Truth! & Fiction! Effective June 1, 2013, aspirin will be heavily taxed under Obamacare. The only explanation given was that they are white and they work. No other reason was given, but I thought you’d want to know about it. This is someone’s attempt at humor but all kidding aside Obamacare not affects consumer purchases of aspirin but it also affects all over the counter medications and how consumers should purchase them.    According to a July 5, 2012 article by Fox News there is a medicine cabinet tax in Obamacare, “which since 2011 has barred the 13.5 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts from purchasing over-the-counter medicines with pre-tax funds.” This is not found in the text of HR-3590 but in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HR-4872). Under the old rules prior to Obamacare consumers could use funds in their HSA or other health insurance tax free savings accounts to purchase medication such as aspirin or allergy drugs.  According to the HSA Resources website funds from HSA may be used to pay for qualified medical expense, such as  ambulance costs, artificial limbs, birth control pills,contact lenses, lab fees,  and prescriptions. Employer healthcare insurance contributions on the 2011 W-2 form will be added to the employee’s gross income- Fiction! The amount entered for employer contributions to the health insurance plans on the W-2 form are for evidence that the employee has health insurance coverage.  This amount will not be taxable nor added to the employee’s gross income. In an April 5, 2010 article called “Health Care Reform: 13 Tax Changes on the Way” , Senior Tax Editor, Joan Pryde of the Washington D.C. based Kiplinger Letters wrote about a “requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income.” “The Mark of the Beast” in the Healthcare Bill- Fiction! A new eRumor began circulating in early April 2010 that claims that the new healthcare reform bill includes requirements for every American to have microchips implanted in their bodies that would contain medical and other encoded personal information.  The email message says it may be a form of the “Mark of the Beast” indicated in the Bible as one of the signs of the end of the world.  It is not true. It refers to what is called in the health care legislation the “National Medical Device Registry.”  The registry does exist in the bill but has nothing to do with requiring implanted microchips in American citizens.  It proposes a national database of medical devices that have already been put into people’s bodies such as artificial knees, artificial hips, heart stents, pacemakers, etc.  The purpose of the registry is to track the effectiveness and performance of the devices. Whoever originated this eRumor took the wording from the bill about the medical device registry and added their own interpretation that it involved microchips and would apply to every person. Individuals and families can opt out of the health care system if they belong to a religious organization that has a health care sharing ministry- Truth! Members of some religious organizations may claim a Religious Conscience Exemption if their sects meet the conditions by having a health care sharing ministry that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a). Members of the Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientists),  might not object to medical care purchasing health insurance.  The church’s official websites says that it teaches members that they “are always free to choose medical treatment, which many individuals feel is the most obvious solution to health difficulties.”  Members might be free to enroll in the health care plan or opt out of it. Amish do not believe an accepting assistance from the government but according to the frequently asked questions section on the Amish.net web site , members of the sect use local doctors, and if they have a medical condition that requires them to do so,  they will seek the help of medical specialists or go to hospitals.  The Amish subscribe to health plans or purchase medical insurance and if they are sick, will treat the ailments at home first. Such individuals and families will not be subject to the 2.5% tax.  This is outlined on pages 326-328 discuss religious conscience exemptions: ‘‘(2) RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS.— ‘‘(A) RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof described in section 1402(g)(1) and an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section. ‘‘(B) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.— ‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual is a member of a health care sharing ministry for the month. ‘‘(ii) HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.—The term ‘health care sharing ministry’ means an organization— ‘‘(I) which is described in section 501(c)(3) and is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), ‘‘(II) members of which share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs and without regard to the State in which a member resides or is employed, ‘‘(III) members of which retain membership even after they develop a medical condition, ‘‘(IV) which (or a predecessor of which) has been in existence at all1 times since December 31, 1999, and medical expenses of its members have been shared continuously and without interruption since at least December 31, 1999, and ‘‘(V) which conducts an annual audit which is performed by an independent certified public accounting firm in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and which is made available to the public upon request. A word about forwarded emails that reference pages from the Affordable Healthcare Act: One of the most common errors concerning the Affordable Healthcare Act that is circulating on the Internet is when the messages reference page numbers to the older versions of the bill.  Text and page numbers from HR-3200 is often found in messages, video and graphics that have gone viral on the World Wide Web or social network cites such as Facebook.   Computer users should exercise discernment before passing them on.

Mandatory end of life counseling every five years to instruct patients how to determine ways to end suffering- Truth! & Fiction! To be excluded by the Senate! On August 13, 2009 the Associated Press reported that, “Key senators are excluding a provision on end-of-life care from health overhaul legislation after language in a House bill caused a furor.” Click for article Betsy McCaughey, a former New York Lt. Governor and conservative health activist, was interviewed on July 16, 2009 on the of former Senator and Presidential candidate Fred Thompson. In the interview she stated that page 425 of the health care bill said that everyone on Social Security & Medicare would have to undergo mandatory counseling every five years to determine ways to end their suffering. The counseling would be more frequent in the case of a terminal illness. McCaughhey’s comments dovetailed with several statements from critics of the health care legislation who claimed that the same portion of the bill could be used to promote euthanasia.  House minority Leader John Boehner and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Thaddeus McCotter said that such concerns were valid.  They are quoted by LifeNews.com as saying, that the measure “could create a slippery slope for a more permissive environment for euthanasia, mercy-killing, and physican-assisted suicide because it does not clearly exclude counseling about the supposed benefits of killing oneself.” The Vice President of AARP, John Rother, disagrees. He said the bill does not, in his view, create a problem of euthanasia. He said that under the bill, Medicare would be required to cover the consultations for the first time but does not mandate that people get end-of-life consultation. He said that any consultation would be with the patient, the doctor or nurse practitioner—not a government bureaucrat. Pages 424 to 434 in the proposed healthcare bill discusses Advance Care Planning and the mandatory consultation is to discuss end of life services such as hospice care and living wills. Click for Fred Thompson interview. Another eRumor originated by the American Family Association warns of Rationing and Euthanasia – Disputed! and Fiction! Don Wildmon of the American Family Association (eRumor example #3) warned that Health Care Bill this could be the next next step towards euthanasia.   Assisted suicide and euthanasia are not mentioned in the text of the bill and differ greatly from hospice care.   Both private medical insurance policies and the proposed Universal Health Care plan have set limitations of coverage and deductibles could be be defined as the “rationing” of benefits. Another eRumor includes a long list of concerns from the organization Family Security Matters. (eRumor Example #2) Pg 22 of the HC Bill mandates the Government will audit books of all employers that self insure. – A Matter of Interpretation! The text of the bill reads, “The Commissioner, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor Secretary of Labor, shall conduct a study of the large group insured and self-insured employer health care markets.”  There is no mention of  audits. Pg 30 Sec 123 of HC bill — a Government committee (good luck with that!) will decide what treatments/benefits a person may receive. – Fiction! The text of the bill reads” IN GENERAL.—There is established a private-public advisory committee which shall be a panel of medical and other experts to be known as the Health Benefits Advisory Committee to recommend covered benefits and essential, enhanced, and premium plans.”  There is no mention of treatment procedures or policies. Pg 29 lines 4-16 in the HC bill — YOUR HEALTHCARE WILL BE RATIONED! (they call it allocated) – Disputed! Rationing could be defined as the controlled distribution of resources and goods or services. This section of the bill deal with cost sharing and co-payments and annual limitations,  The text of the bill says, “The cost-sharing incurred under the essential benefits package with respect to an individual (or family) for a year does not exceed the applicable level specified in subparagraph.”   It is then defined as $5,000 per individual and $10,000 per family each year. The setting of co-payments and coverage limitations is a standard procedure for all medical health plans. Pg 42 of HC Bill — The Health Choices Commissioner will choose your HC Benefits for you.  – Truth! According to the text of the bill, the commissioner’s duties include the establishment and enforcement of “qualified health benefits plan standards”.  The list of his duties also includes the “establishment and operation of a Health Insurance Exchange” and accountability. PG 50 Section 152 in HC bill — HC will be provided to ALL non US citizens, illegal or otherwise. – Disputed! There is no provision to check for citizenship prior to receiving health services even though there are the provisions:. Section 152 is a discrimination clause that basically said that all health services “covered by this Act shall be provided without regard to personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.”   Citizenship is not mentioned. Section 246 on page 143 under the heading of  “NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS” said, “Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States.” Pg 58 HC Bill — Government will have real-time access to individual’s finances and a National ID Health Card will be issued!- Truth !  and Fiction! Under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS”, this section is for a “real-time (or near realtime) determination of an individual’s financial responsibility at the point of service and, to the extent possible, prior to service, including whether the individual is eligible for a specific service with a specific physician at a specific facility, which may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identification card”   Co-payments which need to be collected are part of the plan and it also appears that the new health plan is designed to work with insurance supplement programs.  There is no mention in the bill that personal finance records would be collected. Pg 59 HC Bill lines 21-24 Government will have direct access to your bank accts for election funds transfer. – A Matter of Interpretation! This falls under the heading of “STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSACTIONS” the bill says,”enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.”   The text of the bill is not clear if the electronic funds transfers means between the patient and the health care provider. PG 65 Sec 164 is a payoff subsidized plan for retirees and their families in Unions & community organizations (read: ACORN).- Fiction! Section 164 deals with “REINSURANCE PROGRAM FOR RETIREES” and says, “Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a temporary reinsurance program (in this section referred to as the ‘‘reinsurance program’’) to provide reimbursement to assist participating employment-based plans with the cost of providing health benefits to retirees and to eligible spouses, surviving spouses and dependents of such retirees.”    Unions and community organizations (such as ACORN) do not appear to be singled out in the text of the bill.   Also, non union private business that offer retirement plans and benefits for employees exist in the country.

"The Many Uses of Hydrogen Peroxide-Truth! Fiction! & Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hydrogen-peroxide/"," This eRumor lists a number of different uses for hydrogen peroxide from using it as mouthwash to its alleged value for cleaning sinks. (The full text of the eRumor is at the bottom of this page.) "," Hydrogen peroxide’s chemical representation is H2O2.  It has uses in industry in it’s purest form but the product available to most of us over-the-counter is usually only 3% hydrogen peroxide and 97% water.  It breaks down quickly when exposed to light so it generally comes in brown bottles that filter out the sun’s rays. It is known for its antibacterial qualities. The pure stuff is dangerous if not used correctly. There are also 30%-35% high strength solutions on the commercial market, typically found in health food stores but also sold as a disinfectant. There has been continuing controversy over using hydrogen peroxide either orally or through injection to treat a variety of internal ailments including arthritis and cancer.  Proponents say that the oxygen released by the breakdown of the hydrogen peroxide is medicinal.  Opponents say there isn’t good evidence of the health benefits and that there are circumstances in which hydrogen peroxide can be dangerous.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved those high strength hydrogen peroxide products for use internally and considers them dangerous.  In July, 2006, the FDA issued a warning about the high strength hydrogen peroxides, saying they could lead to serious health risks and even death.  A warning from the BC Cancer Agency in Canada said that over a three year period 6 children were seriously poisoned and one died from drinking the high strength hydrogen peroxide. They report one near-fatal case of an adult ingesting high strength hydrogen peroxide. Let’s go through the claims of the eRumor one at a time: 1. Take one capful (the little white cap that comes with the bottle) and hold in your mouth for 10 minutes daily, then spit it out. (I do it when I bathe or shower.) No more canker sores and your teeth will be whiter without expensive pastes. Use it instead of mouthwash- Truth! But Limited Use! The Merck Manuals recommended diluting the 3% hydrogen peroxide 50 percent with water, but suggest it as a rinse and part of a treatment for trench mouth, for example.  The FDA has approved 3% solutions of hydrogen peroxide for use as a mouthwash.  Most sources said to use it only for a short time, however, such as part of a treatment of a mouth infection.  A report from Well-Connected (written or edited by physicians at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital) recommended against extended use, saying that overuse may actually damage cells and soften tooth surfaces. We were not able to find any authoritative information about hydrogen peroxide and canker sores. 2. Let your toothbrushes soak [in] a cup peroxide to keep them free of germs- Unproven! We didn’t find anything authoritative about soaking toothbrushes in hydrogen peroxide.  Because hydrogen peroxide degrades quickly when exposed to light, if you do soak a toothbrush, do it in freshly poured hydrogen peroxide.  Just keeping an open cup of the stuff around won’t do much good. 3. Clean your counters, table tops with peroxide to kill germs and leave a fresh smell. Simply put a little on your dishrag when you wipe, or spray it on the counters- Truth! 4. After rinsing off your wooden cutting board, pour peroxide on it to kill salmonella and other bacteria- Truth! The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved hydrogen peroxide as a sanitizer. 5. I had fungus on my feet for years – until I sprayed a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water on them (especially the toes) every night and let dry- Unproven! We were not able to find any authoritative source about foot fungus and treatment with hydrogen peroxide.  Again, we are assuming she means a 50/50 mixture of water and 3% hydrogen peroxide.  An actual 50/50 mixture of pure hydrogen peroxide and water would be too high a concentration to be safe. For many of us, hydrogen peroxide was one of the first things we put on a cut or a wound, but that is less recommended nowadays.  The reason, according to numerous medical sites, is that there is a downside to the hydrogen peroxide as well.  It also damages healthy cells that are needed for the wounds to heal and hinders them from getting to the area where the healing needs to take place. The HealthFinder publication of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says don’t use hydrogen peroxide on a wound because it interferes with healing. The U.S. Gymnastics team has followed the recommendations of researchers and uses soap and water for cleansing wounds and not hydrogen peroxide. The National Safety Council’s First Aid Pocket Guide (1996) says “DO NOT use hydrogen peroxide  It does not kill bacteria, and it adversely affects capillary blood flow and wound healing.”   The Mayo Clinic gives the same advice. 7. Put two capfuls into a douche to prevent yeast infections. I had chronic yeast infections until I tried this once or twice a week- Disputed! Interestingly enough, hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced in the vagina to deal with bacteria.  There is conflicting opinion among the experts, however, about whether douching with hydrogen peroxide is helpful or harmful and even some voices that doubt whether douching is necessary at all under normal circumstances. 8. Fill a spray bottle with a 50/50 mixture of peroxide and water and keep it in every bathroom to disinfect without harming your septic system like bleach or most other disinfectants will- But be sure you put the mixture into a bottle that filters out sunlight.  Also, it appears that hydrogen peroxide does not harm septic systems.  Again, this is probably a mixture of 50% water with the other half being 3% or 30% strengths of hydrogen peroxide. 9. Tilt your head back and spray into nostrils with your 50/50 mixture whenever you have a cold, plugged sinus. It will bubble and help to kill the bacteria. Hold for a few minutes then blow your nose into a tissue- Undetermined! We couldn’t find much about this in terms of research.  Again, if you choose to do it, this is probably referring to a mixture of 3% hydrogen peroxide with water. 10. If you have a terrible toothache and can not get to a dentist right away, put a capful of 3% peroxide into your mouth and hold it for ten minutes several times a day. The pain will lessen greatly. 11. And of course, if you like a natural look to your hair, spray the 50/50 solution on your wet hair after a shower and comb it through. You will not have the peroxide burnt blonde hair like the hair dye packages, but more natural highlights if your hair is a light brown, faddish, or dirty blonde. It also lightens gradually so it’s not a drastic change- Truth! One of the classic uses of hydrogen peroxide is to bleach hair. The concentrations are between 3% and 6%.  This suggestion to dilute with water probably applies to those solutions. 12. Put half a bottle of peroxide in your bath to help rid boils, fungus, or other skin infections- Undetermined! The half a bottle probably refers to a 3% solution. 13. You can also add a cup of peroxide instead of bleach to a load of whites in your laundry to whiten them. If there is blood on clothing, pour directly on the soiled spot. Let it sit for a minute, then rub it and rinse with cold water. Repeat if necessary- Truth! But Careful! The effectiveness of this method is a matter of experimentation, but the principle is sound.  Some of the so called “oxygen” bleaches contain hydrogen peroxide. Be careful about the suggestion to use it on spots.  Hydrogen peroxide is a bleach! 14 This list didn’t have it, but I use peroxide to clean my mirrors; there is no smearing, which is why I love it so much for this- Unproven! The original hydrogen peroxide eRumor did not include this.  Some of these were added by people along the way. 15. Gargle with hydrogen peroxide, put drops in the ear and nose to end colds, flu, chronic sinustis (including polyps], and infections. A repeat of some previous information. 16. Use as a vegetable wash or soak to kill bacteria and neutralize chemicals- Truth! We don’t know about the chemicals, but there are several credible references about the use of hydrogen peroxide on fruits or vegetables.  Research published by the Journal of Food and Science in 2003 showed effective results of using hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate apples and melons that were infected with strains of E.coli. 17. Disinfect your dishwasher or refrigerator- Undetermined! 18. Use it on trees and plants as a natural fungicide, insecticide, and as a weed killer- Undetermined! We found no research on the use of hydrogen peroxide as an insecticide, fungicide, or weed killer. 19. Clean with hydrogen peroxide when your house becomes a biohazard after its invaded by toxic mold, such as those with water damage- Truth! In a publication about “Healthy Homes,” the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) listed hydrogen peroxide as among the substances that can be used against mold, but also said there had not been enough research to recommend its use.  It is not known what molds hydrogen peroxide is most effective against or what the human health hazards may be from using it so extensively. Also, since hydrogen peroxide is a bleach, be careful where you use it in terms of preserving the colors in your home. Updated 8/5/06 ","Medical"

It says that the 2004 flu vaccine shortage was the result of sanitation problems at Chiron, the British Company making the vaccine. It further says that the whole liability mess that forced the American companies out of the flu vaccine business was from a lawsuit filed by a man over a flu shot…and that the attorney representing him was Democratic Vice Presidential candidate John Edwards.

"Cancer can be caused by foods in plastics and that’s how Sheryl Crow gotcancer-Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dioxins/"," There are a several versions of this eRumor. The first to appear on the Internet was a message that says a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from the Castle Hospital (no location mentioned) appeared on television and said plastic containers should not be used for heating foods in a microwave oven. He said this is especially true if the foods contain fat. The message claims that the combination of fats and plastics will release dioxins into the food and into the cells of the body with a risk of cancer. The doctor recommended using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers instead in order to avoid the dioxin. Prepared foods such as TV dinners should be taken out of plastic containers before heating. The second version tells the story of a seventh-grade student who decided to do some experiments with microwave radiation on food wrapped in plastic. She is said to have enlisted the help of the National Center for “Toxicological”  Research in Arkansas.  The student allegedly found that not only are there carcinogens migrating from the plastic into food during microwaving, but other substances as well. This eRumor also lists an article about Dr. Edward Fujimoto saying that he appeared on a TV station in Huntsville, Alabama. Another version claims all this was in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center. Yet another version says that singer Sheryl Crow, who is suffering from breast cancer, got her cancer from drinking from plastic water bottles left in the sun and that got too hot and, as a result, were contaminated with dioxins. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find any research that supports the fear that food can become contaminated with dioxins either from plastic wrap or plastic in microwave ovens. It’s an understandable concern because dioxins are among the most poisonous chemical group known and steps have been taken by many world governments to reduce the amounts of dioxins in the environment. Dr. Edward Fujimoto is real and is the Manager of the Wellness and Lifestyle Medicine Department at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii. (not Alabama).  Part of this eRumor is the result of an interview he did on KHON-TV channel 2 in Hawaii on January 23, 2002. TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Fujimoto who said the eRumor quoted him fairly accurately.  His concern was whether a combination of ingredients, especially plastics and food fats, could result in food being contaminated by dioxins when heated in a microwave. That is his observation and he claims to have research substantiating it. TruthOrFiction.com has twice asked for him to give us that research but has never received it.  He said that he is surprised about how little Americans know about dioxins in everyday life because in Japan, the majority of the population knows about them and the country has enacted regulations to protect its people.  He explained that in his view, heating food in a plastic container will produce the release of dioxins and fat will absorb them. The amount of migration of dioxins to fat, he said, will be a function of the heat in the microwave, the type of plastic, the length of time of exposure, and the amount of fat that is in contact.  Dr. Fujimoto pointed out that the amounts of dioxins in any given piece of plastic or food that is microwaved in plastic is very small, but that the problem is that dioxins get into the human body and accumulate. He sad that in Japan, there has been a complete change in the way foods are packaged so that plastic is avoided. They use more glass, for example. In early 2004, a corrupted version of the eRumor started circulating that made it appear as though Dr. Fujimoto was also concerned about putting water in plastic bottles and freezing it, but he never addressed that.  This version of the eRumor also made it sound as though the plastic itself was the problem, not the plastic in combination with food and heat.  It says, for example, that the heat causes dioxin (sic) to “drip from the plastic” into the food but none of the researchers has claimed that. A variation of the bottled water version said that was how singer Sheryl Crow got cancer, by drinking bottled water and that she appeared on the Ellen show or the Oprah show to tell the story. Crow has been treated for breast cancer but she’s never blamed it on bottled water. Another version of eRumor about the seventh-grader has been a little more difficult to detail.  We’ve confirmed that there is a Dr. Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxilogical Research who, along with a Claire V. Nelson, published a paper at a professional event in Orlando, Florida in 1998 and it was on the subject of food contamination from plastic wrap.   We’ve not found the actual study, however, and have never received a response from Dr. Wilkes. The eRumor about Jon Wilkes and Claire Nelson appears to have come from the Options Newsletter published by People Against Cancer at www.peopleagainstcancer.com . The folks who make Saran Wrap have responded to the eRumor.  A statement by the SC Johnson company says the “plasticizer” in Saran Wrap is derivative of naturally occurring citric acid found in citrus fruits and is 100% dioxin free.  The statement further adds that dioxins can only be formed with chlorine is combined with the kinds of high temperatures associated with waste incinerators, temperatures like 1,500 degrees F. Even the most powerful microwaves are not capable of those temperatures, according to the company. SC Johnson says none of its products contains dioxins. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dioxins are both natural and man-made.  The man-made dioxins are released into the air from sources like waste incineration, from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil), and certain types of chemical processing.  Almost every person has been exposed to low levels of dioxins and the EPA says there is research that suggests that high levels of dioxins may be correlated with various health problems, although some of that is extrapolated from studies of animals, not humans. The only reference we could find about dioxins and microwaves was from an FDA publication that was concerned about dioxins resulting from the bleached manufacture of paper goods including milk cartons and some paper containers for microwave dinners.  That was not about plastics and high temperatures, however, and the levels of dioxins were described as safe. The Food and Safety Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has published guidelines for safe cooking in microwave ovens and warns against using materials that are not regarded as microwave safe. CLICK HERE for those guidelines.  You’ll note that one of the guidelines is to avoid letting plastic wraps touch food.  That is another issue, however, and not related to dioxins or high heat in microwaves. The Food and Drug Administration has also issued a statement about plastics and microwaves.v CLICK HERE for that document. The American Plastics Council has also posted a page on the subject. CLICK HERE for their take on the dioxin question. Somewhere along the way someone decided to add that all this information had appeared in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center but neither has promoted the dioxin story. Even though Johns Hopkins has not been the source of the eRumor, there have been enough emails that falsely attributed the story to them that the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health asked Dr. Rolf Halden, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Services at the school’s Center for Water and Health to address the concerns over dioxins. He said that the principal sources of dioxins are from various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and volcanic eruptions.  Plastics do not actually contain dioxins, he said, but wastes that contain certain compounds can serve as dioxin precursors when incinerated. According to Halden, most people are exposed to dioxins when eating meat and fish rich in fat because dioxins that have been sent into the atmosphere become attached to particles that fall back to the earth and get concentrated and store in the fat of fish and other animals. Halden said that the alleged danger or freezing water in plastic bottles is unfounded and an urban legend.  First, because there are no dioxins in plastics.  Second because freezing actually inhibits the release of chemicals.  He said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water in the bottles, not the bottles themselves.  He added that there is another group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle that could disrupt endocrine functions in humans and animals and that heating up the plastics could increase their being released into water and food. Regarding cooking with plastics, Halden said that whenever you heat something it increases the likelihood that chemicals could be pulled out.  he recommends using heat-resistant glass or ceramics for microwave cooking, just to be safe.

"Butter versus Margarine-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/butter-margarine/"," A list of comparative facts about margarine and butter. "," The heart of this eRumor, the comparison between butter and Margarine, has been circulating since 2005.  Later versions added the tidbit about Margarine being manufactured to fatten turkeys. We’ll go through the email one fact at time but it needs to be kept in mind that not every Margarine product is the same.  There are other spreads that are loosely called Margarine but may, for example, be part vegetable oil or a fat-free Margarine product. 1. Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys. When it killed The turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a Payback so they put their heads together to figure out what to do with this Product to get their money back. It was a white substance with no food Appeal so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in Place of butter. How do you like it? They have come out with some clever New flavorings- Fiction! According to the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers, Margarine was the idea of a Frenchman named Hippolyte Mege-Mouriez in response to a request from Emperor Louis Napoleon for ideas for a substitute for butter.  In 1869 he used margaric acid and the name of his formulation became known as Margarine. It became a hit in the United States in the late 1800’s. 2.  Both have the same amount of calories- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 100 calories.  A tablespoon of Margarine is 100 calories. 3.  Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study- Truth! But Updated! We didn’t find the “53%” study, but Harvard School of Public Health has published a report on this.  It says that more than 30 years ago research indicated that saturated fat (such as in butter) was bad for the heart and people were told to switch to margarine.  A Harvard study of women between 1980 and 1994 found a significant reduction of heart disease risk by reducing smoking, hormone treatment, and dietary improvements including reducing or eliminating saturated fat (such as in butter.)  Further research has shown, however, that some margarines contained trans fat, which was even worse for the heart than saturated fat.  The report cautions us not to make decisions as a result of just one study but to consider the body of recent research about an issue like butter versus margarine. 4. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 Grams- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 7g of saturated fat.  A tablespoon of margarine is 2g of saturated fat. 5.  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other Foods- Unproven! We could not find anything definitive about this. 6.   Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! It depends on what you are measuring.  The advantage of butter is that it is a more natural product than margarine and does have more vitamin content.  But butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk.  Saturated fats are the ones that are solid at room temperature and increase the “bad” cholesterol (LDL) as well as the “good” cholesterol (HDL).  The disadvantage of true margarine is the trans fat level.  The more solid a margarine is at room temperature, the more trans fat it contains, as much as 3 grams per tablespoon.  Margarine makers have responded to that by releasing tub or liquid products that have either reduced or eliminated trans fats.  Watch for the labels.  Heart doctors recommend butter over normal margarine but recommend trans fat free margarines over butter.  It all gets very confusing.  There are even margarine products now that say they actually lower cholesterol. 7. Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods- A Matter of Personal Taste! 8. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for Less than 100 years- Fiction! Margarine was introduced as an inexpensive alternative in France in 1869, according to a history found in the Margarine and Spreads Association in the United Kingdom. 9.   Margarine is high in trans fatty acids- Truth! 10.  Margarine triples the risk of coronary heart disease- Unproven! Although trans fats are to be avoided, we did not find any research that says that the use of margarine triples the risk of heart disease. 11. Margarine ncreases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)- Truth! 12. Increases the risk of cancers up to five fold- Fiction! We could not find any substantiation of this claim. 13. Margarine lowers quality of breast milk- Truth! We didn’t find any research on this but there are studies on how a mother’s eating of trans fats affects the level of trans fats in her milk. One study, for example, comparing Canadian breast milk to Chinese breast milk found that Canadian mothers had 33 more trans fats in their milk than the Chinese mothers.  So the quality of the breast milk can be affected by the consumption of trans fats. 14.  Margarine decreases immune response- Truth! We found several references to this including an article by nutritionist Dr. Mary Enig that said that consuming trans fatty acids “Affects immune response by lowering effeciency of B cell response and increasing proliferation of T cells.” 15. Decreases insulin response- Truth! Actually the trans fat can increase blood insulin levels, which increases the risk for diabetes. 16.  Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC- Fiction! We found no support for this.  Perhaps whoever wrote this heard a discussion about the “plasticity” of margarine.  It is “plastic” at room temperature meaning that the shape of it can be changed when pressure is applied.  That doesn’t mean it is composed of what we normally think of as plastic. It was originally made of animal fats but increasingly now is made from vegetable oils. Updated 3/29/07 ","Medical"

"," Anyone who has had treatment for ovarian cancer knows what an important role the CA-125 test can play, but TruthOrFiction.com has reviewed numerous professional documents regarding the CA-125 test and has not found a single one that recommends it alone as the primary screening tool for ovarian cancer. CA-125 is a substance found in the blood of some women with ovarian cancer.  According to the American Cancer Society, however, a CA-125 test is not a reliable tool for finding ovarian cancer because of its poor accuracy.   There is a large number of false negatives because some ovarian cancers do not raise CA-125 levels and some false positives because other conditions can sometimes raise CA-125 levels. Partly in response to the email eRumor, a statement was issued by a medical panel at a conference of the National Institutes of Health in April of 1994 that said the CA-125 test “…alone is not an adequate screening test.” The Louis Busch Hagar Cancer Center of Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown, New York, says that more than 50 percent of the women with ovarian cancer will not show results on a CA-125 test and a statement by the center calls the test a “disappointment.” It is regarded as a valuable tool, however, when sometimes combined with other tests or in targeted groups of women, such as those who have already gone through menopause.   Also, a study in the February 16, 1999 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine and cited by the American Cancer Society found that the CA-125 test was a valuable in tracking the progress of one of the most common forms of ovarian cancer, but that was after the cancer had already been found and was being treated.  The same article says the CA-125 test does not meet the standards of a screening test. According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer and fifth most common cause of cancer death among women and accounts for four percent of all cancers in women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. There is no question that early detection should be every woman’s goal and that she should work with her physician to that end .

"ALS Association Supports Embryonic Stem Cell Research-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/als-association-warning/"," Religious groups have raised concerns that the ALS Association, which has seen an overwhelming influx of donations through its ice bucket challenge, supports embryonic stem cell research to help find a cure for the degenerative neurological condition. "," The ALS Association funds one study that uses   embryonic stem cell research, according to an August 23, 2014, article by the   Minneapolis Star Tribune. The ALS Association said that the research was funded by “one specific   donor who is committed to this area of research.” Additionally, the ALS Association said donors were able to stipulate   that they do not want their donations used to fund any stem cell   research, if they so choose.

After the Obamacare roll out over 5 million people in the US have been notified by mail of policy cancellations from their health insurance companies because they do not meet up to the standards of the new law. "," There have been several reports from various news agencies, including CBS , Forbes , NBC and Fox that said millions throughout the U.S. are loosing their health insurance coverage.  The number has exceeded five million and it is expected to grow larger. The Obama administration “knew millions could not keep their health insurance.” This according to an October 28, 2013 article by NBC , which also warned that “50 to 75 percent of the 14 million consumers who buy their insurance individually can expect to receive a ‘cancellation’ letter or the equivalent over the next year because their existing policies don’t meet the standards mandated by the new health care law.” The state of California was hardest hit, according to a November 12, 2013 article by a CBS-TV affiliate in Sacramento that said, “More than 1 million cancellation notices have been sent to Californians as the Affordable Care Act begins allowing individuals to buy insurance through exchanges.” On November 20, 2013, citing the independent analysis of the American Enterprise Institute, a Fox News article said that 50 to 100 million more people are expected to lose there health insurance policies. Insurance Premium Sticker Shock To make matters worse, the ACA is driving premium costs higher.  On November 6, 2013, NBC News reported that the new conditions set into policies “To a larger degree than other requirements of the law, it is fueling the ‘sticker shock’ now being voiced by some consumers about premiums for new policies, say industry experts.”  This means people will either have to pay more to get similar coverage to what they are used to or shop for a plan with a higher deductible and less benefits. On November 7, 2013 President Obama, in an interview on NBC News, said that he was sorry “to Americans who are losing their health plans.”   This according to a Washington Post article dated the same day. As of November 2, 2013, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that 106,185 people have signed up for new health care policies, a number 1/5 the number of enrollments anticipated by the Obama Administration.  This according to a November 13, 2013 article by CNBC. Keep Your Health Plan Act On October 28, 2013 HR-3350: Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 was introduced in the House of Representatives and is currently in the committee process.  The purpose of the bill is  “to authorize health insurance issuers to continue to offer for sale current individual health insurance coverage in satisfaction of the minimum essential health insurance coverage requirement, and for other purposes.” There are also a couple of bills on the Senate side.

On November 4, 2013 Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) introduced S. 1642: Keeping the Affordable Care Act Promise Act .  The bill currently has five sponsors, including California’s Senator Dianne Feinstein. On November 13, 2013 Fox News reported that the “House Democrats delivered a fix-it-or-else ultimatum Wednesday to President Obama, giving his administration until Friday to find an affordable solution for the millions of Americans losing their health plans under ObamaCare — or risk some Democrats backing a Republican solution.”   The article also said that the “ultimatum from President Obama’s own party is another sign of the unrest within the Democratic caucus about the cancellation notices.”   It is unknown if the Democrat Representatives would support the HR-3350 bill if the administration fails to come up with an alternative solution. There are resources on the Govtrack.com site for people to follow the bill and call their Congressional Representatives to urge them to support the bill.    Concerned citizens should also call the White House at (202) 456-1414 and ask the President to support the bill by encouraging the Senate to read the bill and vote for it.

"Test to determine a whether a stroke is happening-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/stroke-test/"," The eRumor says that the American Stroke Associations suggests a simple three question test to give to someone who may be experiencing the symptoms of a stroke. "," According to the website of the American Stroke Association (ASA) this eRumor is true.  The American Stroke Association is a division of the American Heart Association. In an article published in February of 2003, the ASA says that a 60-second test can help determine whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  The three question test has been used by health care professionals as an initial way of determining whether someone may be experiencing a stroke.  But a research project by North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, N.C. looked into the question of whether non-medical professionals could administer the short test and correctly identify the symptoms of a possible stroke.  The conclusions was yes, that bystanders could be helpful in determining whether a person is experiencing a stroke.  One of the reasons they looked into it was to see whether bystanders could be helpful to a 9-1-1 dispatcher in helping narrow down what is happening to a potential patient. The three questions given to the suspected stroke sufferers were: Can you raise your arms and keep them up? Can you smile? Can you repeat a simple sentence? The study found that when non-medical volunteers were asked by a telephone dispatcher to administer the test, they correctly identified the symptoms 96 percent of the time…especially the raising of the arms and the speaking of a simple sentence.  They were less effective in evaluating whether there was facial weakness in a smile, probably because of not knowing what the person’s normal smile looked like.  Doctors caution that this does not mean that citizens should try to diagnose stroke symptoms themselves. This study focused on citizens who were being given instruction over the telephone by emergency dispatchers. Any sign of weakness in the face, slurred speech, or weakness or numbness in the limbs should be evaluated by medical professionals immediately. If stroke victims are given proper help within 3 hours of the stroke, the ability to recover is greatly increased.

"," There is controversy over rBST, which stands for recombinant bovine somatotropin.  It is an artificial growth hormone used in cows. We’ve not found the family of Marissa, the 11-year old girl referenced in the eRumor.  If she is real her family’s suspicions are worthy of consideration but do not constitute proof that what they describe has been caused by ingesting milk from Wal-Mart.  There are other conditions that can cause early menstruation such as hypothyroidism.  Also, although there are fears, there is not scientific agreement about whether rBST is harmful to humans. RBST is a synthetic version of bST or BGH, a natural growth hormone in cows which, among other things, affects the amount of milk produced by a dairy cow.  Use of bST to increase milk production has been around since the 1930’s then along then the synthetic version came into popularity. Critics of the use of rBST say that it is banned for use in cattle in virtually every major country in the world except the United States.  They point out that there is an increase in health problems in cattle that produce the most milk so the use of rBST should be avoided on that ground. Supporters say rBST helps dairy farmers with better milk yield and that there has not been any proof that the hormone causes problems in humans.  It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although this eRumor focused on Wal-Mart milk there are several different milk companies that use cattle treated with rBST and Wal-Mart also sells milk from cows that are not injected with it.  Because of the controversy over rBST a lot of the milk products without it are labeled as such and are not hard to find.

A major epidemic spread through Africa from 1959-1961 and reached as far as Arabia, Pakistan and India. In all, 300,000 horses were killed in that outbreak. More recently, African Horse Sickness outbreaks have been reported in a number of sub-Saharan countries in Africa, according to the Merck Veterinary Manual .

"," The television report is true.  Whether John Kanzius’ discovery is revolutionary or not remains to be seen. Kanzius is a former television station owner and broadcast engineer from Pennsylvania who now lives in Florida. According to the report, Kanzius came up with an idea for using radio waves to kill cancer cells.  It involved injecting tiny bits of certain metals into cancer patients—metals that would be attracted by the cancer cells.  Since radio waves can make certain metals hotter, the thought was that the radiated pieces of metal might make the cancer cells die. Kanzius has a personal interest in the quest.  He has been diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. Along the way Kanzius made an accidental discovery of a different nature.  He found that when salt water was placed into the radio waves, it would burst into flame—an incredibly hot flame.  He said it was because the hydrogen and the oxygen were being released from the salt water. A company in Akron has checked out Kanzius’ discovery and says it’s quite remarkable.  A small steam engine has been constructed to demonstrate the potential. There is work to be done, though, before the radio wave-salt water device will be powering cars or generating plants.  A lot of energy goes into creating the radio waves in the first place so there needs to be some assessment as to whether the energy that comes from it is worth it. Meanwhile, his original goal of fighting cancer is being looked into.  In January, 2007, researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston say they reached a milestone by killing pancreatic cancer cells in the laboratory using Kanzius’ method.  Next will be animal experimentation then human.

"," It’s true that a former post-doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University questioned the safety and effectiveness of flu vaccines in a scholarly article, but that view isn’t widely accepted in the epidemiology field. Peter Doshi was a post-doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine when he published an article in the British Medical Journal in May 2013 titled “Influenza: Marketing Vaccine by Marketing Disease.” Doshi argued in the article that flu vaccines could be less beneficial and less safe than once believed, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has overstated the threat of influenza. After his fellowship ended, Doshi became an assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, according to the school’s website . Doshi’s article gained widespread attention when the website Newsmax Health reported on it in May 2013. Still, Doshi’s views are not widely accepted in the epidemiology field.

"EV-D68 Outbreak is Spreading Due to Illegal Immigrant Children -Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/evd68-outbreak/"," The U.S. has seen an explosion in the number of cases of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) because illegal immigrant children allegedly brought the enterovirus to the U.S. and have fueled the respiratory condition’s transmission. "," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a dramatic rise in enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases by October 2014, but there’s no evidence that illegal immigrant children are responsible for the outbreak. EV-D68 isn’t a new non-polio enterovirus. It was first identified in California in 1962, and the CDC has regularly confirmed a handful of EV-D68 cases in the U.S. each year since 1987. Health officials have also identified clusters of EV-D68 outbreaks in Japan, the Philippians and the Netherlands in recent years. No clusters of outbreaks had been reported in Central America or Mexico. By October 2014, nearly 700 cases of EV-D68 had been confirmed in 46 states across the U.S. Arizona and Nevada were the only continental states that did not have a confirmed EV-D68 case as of October 2014. The 2014 outbreak was first identified in Illinois and Missouri, and from there it’s believed to have spread to the Southeast. Given the history of EV-D68 in the U.S., and the progression of the 2014 outbreak, there’s no evidence that it was fueled by an influx of illegal immigrant children. And when it comes to vaccinations for preventable diseases like polio and measles, the vast majority of children from Central America are vaccinated, the Texas Observer reports . Health professionals also indicate that the biggest difference with the 2014 EV-D68 strain may be that it’s more potent than in years past, not that it was more prevalent. Some children who were stricken with the EV-D68 strain in 2014 even exhibited polio-like symptoms, the Atlantic reports . “What’s different this year are the number of children coming to the ER and actually being sick enough to be admitted or end up in the pediatric intensive care unit,” Lisa Miller, division director for Disease Control and Environmental Epidemiology at Colorado’s Department of Public Health, said. “Those numbers were higher than normal for this time of year. That’s what first got people’s attention, how sick these children were.” In the past, many cases of EV-D68 were not diagnosed because it often caused mild, flu-like symptoms that could be treated with over-the-counter therapies, Vox Media reports . The CDC said the current strain had led to heightened public awareness and a spike in testing, which led to an increase in confirmed cases. Posted  10/14/14 ","Medical"

It tells the story of an anthropologist named Susan McKinley who returned from a trip to South America with a rash that evolved into a worm-infested breast. "," We have not found anything to substantiate the Susan McKinley story or the photograph of the alleged larvae in a female breast. There is no alarm being spread by doctors about getting worms from new and unwashed bras. The picture accompanying the eRumor is a fabrication.

The video that comes with some versions of the eRumor, however, is real but has nothing to do with either the story told in the eRumor or the photograph. The eRumor circulated for more than two years before the video started appearing attached to it. The video shows a close-up of a medical worker using tweezers to remove worms from a woman’s breast. It is from a case reported from Africa in which Nigerian woman has what is called “cutaneous myiasis” of the breast due to an infestation by the larva of the Tumbu fly. The medical report says it is the only reported instance of the infestation so there is no need for spreading an alarm. It is interesting, if not coincidental, to note that the woman who had the infestation was described as spreading her washed clothes outside for drying and not ironing them before wearing them. The eRumor makes reference to that as well and it brings up the question of whether the warning was initiated by someone who knew of the lone case. Some more recent versions of the story also include pictures of a couple of white worms that it says are the type that are infesting the breast.

"Women and Children in Portions of Africa are Being Sexually Violated by Men Who Believe That Sex With a Virgin will Cure Their AIDS-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/virgin-aids-cure/"," This eRumor says that there is a myth in Africa, especially South Africa, that having sex with a virgin will cure AIDS.  It talks about an epidemic of infected males violating virgins, including children because of the belief that the younger the virgin, the more potent the cure.  It references the rape of a 9-month-old by 6 men.  It also says that another 9-month-old was raped and is fighting for her life.  The email asks you to participate in an email petition to retain the Child Protection Unit in South Africa. "," This is one of the issues TruthOrFiction.com has often cited as an example of “urban legends that kill.” The spread of AIDS in Africa is startling and the debris in the lives of its people is heartbreaking.  Jeffrey Bartholet said in the 1/17/2000 issue of Newsweek that 85 percent of the world’s deaths from AIDS in 1999 were in Africa.  The life expectancy in some African countries is decreasing alarmingly.  In the same issue, a different article said there are millions of orphans in Africa whose parents have died of aids and that in Sub-Sahara Africa, 6,000 men and women are dying each day of AIDS. Added to that, however, is the rumor in parts of Africa, including large portions of South Africa, that having sex with a virgin will cleanse a male of AIDS.  The Johannesburg city council conducted a three-year study of about 28,000 men.  They found that 1 in 5 believed in the virgin-AIDS cure.  The fallout from that is a rise in assaults of women and children, some of whom contract AIDS themselves. Of particular alarm has been the rise in infant rapes.  Not all researchers blame that on the virgin-AIDS cure myth, but they believe it has contributed to it.  The rape of the nine-month-old by six men in Upington at the end of 2001 enraged many South Africans.  That was followed by the discovery of a seven-month-old who had been raped and left for dead in a suburb of Capetown in November, 2001.  There have been other high profile cases since. The eRumor asks readers to add their names to an email petition to protest the closing down of South Africa’s Child Protection Unit, but South Africa’s Minister of Safety and Security, Steve Tshwete, says the unit is not being closed.  That rumor got started in mid-2001 when a parliamentary committee convened to discuss the unit and observers though it meant the unit was in trouble. Christina Jordaan, a social worker for the Department of Education in South Africa, says there is a companion myth to the virgin-AIDS cure that says that if a girl has her hymen intact, she will not contract AIDS (CBS Healthwatch, 10/2000) Complicating the problem in South Africa is a revival of an old Zulu system of virginity testing.  According to the July, 1999 issue of the AIDS Information Newsletter, tens of thousands of young people in South Africa are participating in the practice in which an adult examines a girl for evidence of virginity.   Proponents say it promotes and honors abstinence, which helps cut down on sexual activity, pregnancy, and disease.  Opponents say it’s like advertising the virgins to potential perpetrators.  The girls who pass the test get white stars on their foreheads and a certificate of virginity. The belief in the virgin-AIDS cure is not restricted to Africa.  According to a Knight-Ridder report from Mark McDonald in January of 2000, it is also helping fuel an increase in child prostitution in Cambodia.  McDonald says there are many Asian men who believe that having sex with a virgin will cleanse their AIDS.  The same is true for India, according to the Fall, 1995 Harvard AIDS Review, and Jamaica, according to the Ministry of Health in Jamaica.  The belief in curing AIDS by having sex with a virgin is apparently an outgrowth of a long-standing belief in many cultures in the restorative and healing powers of virgins and having sex with virgins.

"," We don’t know whether this particular first-hand account is true but the concerns about Zircam are not fabricated. Zicam is the brand name of products from Matrixx Initiatives.  The company promotes its Zicam Cold Remedy nasal gel by saying that it shortens your cold.  Their website says it will “…help you get over your cold three times faster.”  Matrixx has several other Zicam products for both adults and children that are for flu, allergies, congestion, and sinus problems. Concerns about whether Zicam might be causing a loss of smell began accumulating in 2004.  Zicam contains a form of zinc (zinc gluconate) and medical researchers pointed to the 1930’s when another form of zinc (zinc sulfate) was used nasally in an attempt to protect from polio.  One of the results was that some users lost their sense of smell.  Matrixx countered by saying that the two forms of zinc should not be equated.   The anti-polio products had concentrated forms of the sulfate which, according to Matrixx, reacted with water to create a strong acid.  The gluconate in their product, said Matrixx, is a weak organic salt that dissolves into a “…naturally occurring, non toxic compound found in all human tissue.” Matrixx had strongly denied that Zicam destroys the sense of smell and taste and when contacted by TruthOrFiction.com about this story sent us a summary of a two-day meeting of its Scientific Advisory Board in September, 2004.  It said, “was the unanimous opinion of the Scientific Advisory Board that the cumulative scientific evidence does not support the contention that Zicam® Cold Remedy zinc gluconate nasal gel is associated with disorders of smell.”   The panel concluded that a loss of smell is most commonly associated with the common cold, sinusitis, and nasal injury and that there are statistically significant associations between the pernament loss of smell and numerous other medical conditions and multiple classes of drugs.  In other words, the board felt that there was not enough evidence in the midst of all those other factors to pinpoint Zicam as the culprit. Nonetheless, the lawsuits kept coming and in January, 2006, Matrixx, without admitting any fault, settled a class action lawsuit with 340 people for nearly $12 million. As of this writing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had not looked into the Zicam complaints. Updated 10/27/06 ","Medical"

We will post findings here if we find anything. Still, there’s hope that okra, a plant high in fiber and vitamin C, may offer health benefits to diabetes sufferers. This according to a 2011 study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information concluded that dried and ground okra peels and seeds decreased blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.    The study said, ““There are many reports available to support the multiple mechanisms of antidiabetic plants to exert their blood glucose lowering effect, such as inhibition of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, regeneration of damaged pancreatic islet cells and enhancement of insulin secretion and release,” the researchers concluded.” It is always a good practice to check with primary care physicians before changing any medical treatment or substituting prescribed medications for natural remedies.

"Health Benefits of Oil Pulling-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/oil-pulling/"," Swishing oil around in your mouth for 20 minutes may reap some health benefits. "," We have not found any evidence that this holistic treatment for gingivitis and other conditions of the mouth, gums, throat or the rest of the body is better than or equal to the methods used in modern medicine. According to the Foodmatter.TV website , “Oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic remedy for oral health and detoxification. It involves the use of pure oils as agents for pulling harmful bacteria, fungus, and other organisms out of the mouth, teeth, gums and even throat.”    Ayurvedic is a traditional/alternative practice of medicine that comes from India and dates back to 5000 BCE. This is what ancient health practitioners used before the discovery of antibiotics. It is always sound advice to consult a medical professional before approaching alternative treatment for such conditions. Also, this should not replace dentist office visits to remove accumulating  plaque on teeth, which is the primary cause for the gum disease gingivitis.   Seeing a dentist twice a year with a daily regiment of brushing, flossing and mouth washing with a mouthwash is still what dentists consider to be the best maintenance program for chronic sufferers of gum disease.

"Onions Prevent Influenza Infection-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/onions-flu/"," This is a forwarded email about onions.   It says that during a 1919 influenza scare farmers would cut onions and place them on plates to  ward off infection.   It also warns about leftover onions and how they can be poisonous to dogs. "," There is no medical evidence that onions attracts viruses.  Onions have been mythically thought to ward off diseases since the days of the bubonic plague in the middle ages.   The Vetinfo.com web site does warn that onions are unsafe for dogs and included the tasty vegetable on their list of toxins for dogs. Left over onions, alone, may not be toxic but can easily pick up contamination from preparation utensils. FoodHygieneTraining.com , a website in the United Kingdom offering expert food safety tips, suggests using different cutting boards when preparing meals and vegetables, to prevent cross-contamination.    The web site also warns that bacteria, viruses and parasites can grow in a matter of 20 minutes on a cutting board that was used for uncooked meat if not cleaned properly. It is not difficult for onions and other vegetables to pick up  such microorganism that are invisible to the naked eye.  Natural enzymes in vegetables may even inhibit growth. If stored improperly, onions can eventually go bad.  The National Onion Association posted suggestions on their web site regarding the storage of unprepared onions recommending that be stored in a cool dry place where air can be allowed to circulate.  Depending on the type, onions can be last in storage between 30 to 180 days.  They also said that “Chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in your refrigerator for up to 7 days.” updated 02/26/10 ","Medical"

Her understanding of pharmacology and metabolism is largely incorrect”.  He concludes by saying, “…, this series of allegations by MS. Markle are almost totally without foundation. They are rabidly inaccurate and scandalously misinformative.” 4.  The American Diabetes Association says it “…recognizes that there is no credible scientific evidence linking aspartame to any health-related problems for people with diabetes.” and that “…aspartame–as well as the other FDA-approved nonnutritive sweeteners saccharin, acesulfame K, and sucralose–acceptable sugar substitutes and a safe part of a diabetic meal plan.” http://www.diabetes.org/community/info_news/news/aspartame.jsp 5.  The official NutraSweet website has a response to the email at http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/search.asp?Id=61&srch=danger .

Researchers with the American Society of   Topical Medicine and Hygiene estimated that there were about 300,000 cases of Chagas disease in the U.S. by   early November 2014. The potentially fatal disease is caused by an   infection by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, or T. cruzi, and was   first diagnosed in the U.S. in 2007. Kissing bugs feed on the blood of sleeping humans and animals. After   they feed, infected bugs defecate, and T. cruzi parasites from their   feces are able to enter the body through the eyes, mouth, nose or an   open wound, according to the Mayo Clinic . The   Mayo Clinic says it’s also possible to become infected by eating   uncooked contaminated food, blood transfusions, infected pets and   spending time in forests where infected animals like raccoons and   opossums live. Symptoms of Chagas disease are often mild or non-existent at first,   which is why it’s called “the silent killer.” As the disease progresses,   patients experience fever, body aches and swelling around the bite mark.   More advanced symptoms include irregular heartbeat, an enlarged heart,   problems with digestion and bowel movements and strokes, according to   the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC). The   World Health Organization estimates that 8 million people are infected with Chagas disease, most of them in   Latin America. Researchers from Baylor University collected 40 kissing bugs from 11   counties in south-central Texas and identified 17 patients from Houston   who were diagnosed with Chagas disease, the Washington Posts reported in   November 2014. “We   are astonished to not only find such a high rate of individuals testing   positive for Chagas in their blood, but also high rates of heart disease   that appear to be Chagas-related,” Nolan Garcia, a researcher with the   American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, said .

"Doctors More Dangerous Than Gun Owners-Humorous Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doctor-deaths/"," The forwarded email compares the rate of accidental deaths between physicians and gun owners and concludes that rate of accidental deaths per physician is much higher than the rate of accidental deaths per gun owner. "," This email is obviously the humorous creation    of a gun enthusiast. We don’t know when it was written but not all of  the statistics    appear accurate. According to the U.S. Department of    Health Services there were about 780,000 licensed physicians in the United    States in 2008, so that figure seems good. Finding statistics that everybody agrees with regarding deaths caused by    doctors is a little more difficult.  Dr. J. Mercola released a book    in 2000 titled Doctors are the Third Leading Cause of Death in the US,    Causing 250,000 Deaths Every Year. His breakdown, however,    largely focuses on errors in hospitals and includes 12,000 deaths by    unnecessary surgery, 7,000 due to medication errors in hospitals, 20,000    due to other errors in hospitals, 80,000 from infections in hospitals, and    106,000 from the negative effects of medications. Regarding gun owners, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA) 2010   Fact Sheet , they tallied in the U.S. between 70 and 80 million.    The NRA fact sheet also said that there are close to 300 million   privately owned firearms in the United States with hand guns counting   for nearly 100 million and that somewhere between 40-45% of American   households have firearms. According to the National Rifle    Association there were 776 accidental deaths from firearms in 2000, a    lower figure than in the email.

"Ebola Has Gone Airborne-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ebola-airborne/"," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United Nations (UN) have been forced to admit that Ebola has gone airborne and can be contracted by breathing in germs. "," Ebola has not gone airborne, and the disease can only be transmitted through the bodily fluids or blood of infected humans or animals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says Ebola cannot be spread through air or water. There’s also no evidence that mosquitoes and other insects are able to transmit Ebola because the virus has only been shown to infect mammals. But people who rely on “bushmeat,” or wild game, for food in Africa could be at risk of contracting Ebola from handling or consuming the meat of an infected animal. Contrary to the eRumor’s claims, the CDC hasn’t changed its position on Ebola going airborne. The CDC warns that Ebola could, however, be transmitted by coughing or sneezing if mucus or saliva — both bodily fluids — were projected from an infected person onto an unaffected person. Anthony Banberry, the UN’s Ebola response chief, told the Telegraph on October 2, 2014, that Ebola going airborne would be a “nightmare scenario” that could plausibly happen. But Banberry said that scenario was “unlikely,” and he did not warn that Ebola “is possibly now, and probably soon will be an airborne pathogen,” as the eRumor claims. In fact, no virus that is transmitted by bodily fluids has ever gone airborne over the course of human history, David Heymann, chairman of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said in at a panel discussion of the virus. “There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology,” Heymann said. Other serious viruses like HIV and Hepatitis B that are transmitted by bodily fluids never morphed into respiratory viruses, Heymann noted. Posted 10/10/14 ","Medical"

The inspiration for the eRumor was the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat two white American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia. Drug developer Mapp Biopharmaceutical said clinical trials were needed to see how safe and effective the drug was, and that it hadn’t been distributed in West Africa because quantities were extremely limited. ZMapp isn’t a vaccine, however. It’s a therapeutic drug designed to treat people who already have Ebola. Vaccines, meanwhile, prevent people from contracting viruses all together.

Rumors spread that a deputy who had been inside Duncan’s apartment was hospitalized and tested for Ebola on October 8, 2014, after he fell ill.

Medical officials ordered a test to quell public fear, even though the deputy didn’t have contact with the Ebola patient or any contaminated items, the Texas Health Commission reported . “The risk is extremely low because this individual didn’t have contact with the Ebola patient, but we want to err on the side of caution,” Lakey said. False reports of a confirmed Ebola case in Hawaii also swarmed the Internet in early October 2014. The Hawaii Department of Health said an individual who had been held in isolation with Ebola-like symptoms did not meet the criteria for Ebola testing. “The hospital acted in the best interest of the community, with an abundance of caution,” Hawaii Health Director Dr. Linda Rosen said. “After our investigation by the health department, it was determined that the individual did not meet the clinical or travel exposure criteria for a an Ebola infection.” More false reports of Ebola cases are likely with the public on high alert.

"Tampax Pearl Tampons","2015-03-17 16:37:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tampaxpearl/"," The story is that an unnamed woman who had been using Tampax Pearl tampons for five months had a series of problems including yeast infections. Visits to doctors don’t provide relief.  At one point, the woman discovers that fibers from the tampon have been accumulating in her vagina.  The email postulates that the fiber mass was both causing the problems and preventing doctors from finding the cause.  It says the lady is thinking about filing a lawsuit and fearing Toxic Shock Syndrome. "," According to the folks at Procter and Gamble, the maker of the Tampax Pearl tampons, this email was started by a woman who claims she was relating the experience of a friend of hers, but the woman has refused to reveal her friend’s identity so the story is without substantiation. If the story is not true, then it is a fabrication and probably came from the fears and imagination of a person who felt discomfort about the Tampax Pearl tampons and wanted to create a story that gave substance to her warnings. The fears may have been based on genuine concerns about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which can be fatal. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the number of TSS cases in recent years has been less than a dozen each year, some of which have been associated with the use of tampons, especially among young women. TSS has also occurred, however, in children, men, and non-menstruating women. The FDA says a connection between TSS and some types of Tampons has been suggested, especially associated with materials that are no longer used in Tampons in the United States. An FDA report says, “Vaginal dryness and ulcerations may occur when women use tampons more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Ulcerations have also been reported in women using tampons between menstrual periods to try to control excessive vaginal discharge or abnormal bleeding. Women may avoid problems by choosing a tampon with the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow and using tampons only during active menstruation.” For more information, CLICK HERE for the FDA page on tampons.

"Popular substance in cold medications pulled from the shelves-Truth!& Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/phenylpropanolamine/"," There are several different versions of emails warning against taking medications that contain phenylpropanolamine, which is popular in cold and decongestant products as well as some weight loss products.    Some of the emails list the over-the-counter products that contain phenylpropanolamine.  It also urges you to call the product manufacturers to get a refund. "," According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA), all firms that use phenylpropanolamine in their products are being asked to voluntarily discontinue them. The suggestion from the eRumor that there are refunds on the products is a hoax. Phenylpropanolamine is commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter nasal decongestants and weight control products. The FDA action was in response to a study by researchers at Yale University that found an increased risk of stroke in people who were using products with phenylpropanolamine in them. The FDA says the chance of stroke is small and was found to have mostly affected women, but because of the seriousness of stroke and the difficulty in predicting who could be at risk, it was best to ask for the manufacturers to voluntarily remove it. One of the problems in the wake of the FDA request is that some emails circulating on the Internet and that list particular products from particular companies give the impression that the company should be blamed for a defective product, a misunderstanding that the drug manufacturers are worried about.  They want the public to know that they are voluntarily removing phenylpropanolamine from their products. Some versions of the story say phenylpropanolamine is also harmful to children, but that was not a conclusion of the Yale study. The FDA posted a notice on their website saying that they are “aware of emails circulating widely that list many products allegedly containing PPA. These emails, however, generally contain dated and inaccurate information and should be ignored.” Click for FDA notice updated 01/18/09 A version of the eRumor that has appeared on the Internet: All drugs containing PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE are being recalled.  You may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and inquire about a REFUND.

"Poinsettia plants are poison to children and pets-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/poinsettias/"," It’s common around Christmas time for people to warn one another about the alleged toxicity of poinsettias. "," This is one of those beliefs that is so widespread that a survey of       florists found that most of them believed it to be true. That’s       because it has been the conventional understanding about poinsettias       for many years. The consensus of government agencies, health centers, veterinary       groups, and plant and       flower organizations that we’ve surveyed, however, is that poinsettias are not       toxic and do not pose a health threat to children or pets. The belief in poinsettia poison appears to extend back to 1919 when       the two-year-old child of a U.S. Army officer died.  It was       believed that the death was caused by the child ingesting poinsettia       leaves.  The American Society of Florists has looked into the       matter extensively and says there was never any proof that       poinsettia leaves were responsible for the child’s death and the       report was later determined to be hearsay. The America Society of Florists joined with researchers at Ohio       State University to test various parts of the poinsettia plant on       rats.  Their conclusion was that there was no toxicity or any       other side effects even when the rats were given large       doses. POISENDEX is the source of poison information for the majority of poison       control centers.  It says that a 50-pound child would have to       eat more than a pound-and-a-quarter of poinsettia leaves to exceed       the doses used in the Ohio State research, which would be 500 to 600       leaves. The American Society of Florists says no other consumer plant has       been tested for toxicity more than the poinsettia. The ASPCA Animal Poison Center in Urbana, Illinois says it regards       poinsettias as having such low toxicity risk that it doesn’t even       recommend decontaminating animals that may have ingested them.        The center says that there can sometimes be gastrointestinal       distress from having ingested something alien to the digestive       system. The American Veterinary       Medicine Association of America (AVMA), doesn’t include poinsettias       on its list of plants that are a threat to animals. Because of the belief that poinsettias are toxic, there are numerous       visits to hospitals each year by concerned parents or pet owners whose children       or pet have ingested or in some other way been exposed to       poinsettias. A study released in 2000 by Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and       Carnegie Mellon University found that out of nearly 23,000       poinsettia exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide,       there was essentially no toxicity of significance of any kind.

"," Dr. Ken Alibek is acknowledged as one of the world’s foremost       experts on not only bioterrorism, but on anthrax.  He was the head of the Soviet Union’s offensive biological weapons program       before defecting to the United States and is now a private       consultant on biological weapons defense.  According to Reuters       News Service, he was participating in a briefing for members of       Congress during the third week in October when he said that hot,       moist heat could kill anthrax spores.  “If you are scared,       just iron this letter,” he told lawmakers. “After that, they       become harmless.” In an AP article from October 19, Arthur Trapotsis, a scientist from       Boston, said “Anthrax is easy to kill.”  His company       makes steam sterilizers, one of the options that companies are       considering to try to eliminate anthrax that could come through the       mail. While there is agreement that steam can kill anthrax spores, there       is not agreement about relying on a steam iron to do it. The 10/19 AP story says that other experts estimate that in order       for the ironing of an envelope to be effective, it would have to be       done continuously for 20 minutes.  Dr. John Clements of Tulane       University in New Orleans told ABC News “Steam irons are not       going to get you where you need to be.”  There is also       concern over the fact that there are different kinds of envelopes       made from different substances.  Would all of them allow the       steam to affect their contents?

"," The    experts are saying it’s a hoax, a fabricated story.  We’ve checked    with several sources for veterinary medicines and veterinary training    schools and none of them has ever heard of Progesterex.  The Food and    Drug Administration, which regulates medications for both humans and    animals, has no knowledge of it.  The other drug mentioned, Rohypnol,    does exist and has the reputation of being a date-rape drug.     According to the FDA, it’s not legal in the United States but is used in    Europe as, among other things, a sedative.  The FDA says it not only    induces sleep, but those who have taken it frequently cannot remember    anything that happened while they were under the influence of the    drug. A real example of the story as it has    been circulated: Ladies, be more alert and cautious when getting a drink offer from a guy.    Good guys out there, please forward this message to your lady friends.    Andboyfriends,take heed. There is a new drug that has been out for less    than a year.

Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals. Rumour has it    that the Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape    drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girls    drink. The girl cant remember a thing the next morning, of all that had    taken place the night before. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the    victim doesnt conceive from the rape and the rapist neednt worry    about having a paternity test identifying him months later. The drugs effects ARENT TEMPORARY. Progesterex was designed to    sterilize horses. Any female that takes it WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE.    The crooks can get this drug from anyone who is in the vet school of any    university. Its that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses    everywhere.

Her    understanding of pharmacology and metabolism is largely    incorrect”.  He concludes by saying, “…, this series of    allegations by MS. Markle are almost totally without foundation. They are    rabidly inaccurate and scandalously misinformative.” 4.  The American Diabetes Association says it “…recognizes    that there is no credible scientific evidence linking aspartame to any    health-related problems for people with diabetes.” and that    “…aspartame–as well as the other FDA-approved nonnutritive    sweeteners saccharin, acesulfame K, and sucralose–acceptable sugar    substitutes and a safe part of a diabetic meal plan.” http://www.diabetes.org/community/info_news/news/aspartame.jsp 5.  The official NutraSweet website has a response to    the email at http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/search.asp?Id=61&srch=danger .
