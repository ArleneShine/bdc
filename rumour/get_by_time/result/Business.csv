"The Buffet Rule and the Congressional Reform Act of 2017-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-22 08:06:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/buffet-rule/"," A chain email that has been in circulation since at least 2011 discusses Warren Buffet’s five-minute plan, known as the “The Buffet Rule,” to fix Congress for good. Tho "," During a 2011 interview, Warren Buffet said he could end the federal deficit and fix Congress in less than five minutes using what has become known as “The Buffet Rule” — but Buffet’s reps later said he wasn’t making a serious policy proposal. Buffet made the comment that gave rise to “The Buffet Rule” email during an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick. And the comment has since been attached to chain emails and blog posts about the Congressional Reform Act. Recently, the Buffet Rule has begun trending again with claims about the Congressional Reform Act of 2017 (more on that later). The exchange came during a discussion about the federal deficit and congressional turmoil as Democrats and Republicans faced a budget standoff that later resulted in the federal government temporarily shutting down: BUFFETT: And that’s a real question and the question is whether you’re better off making decisions on those things at the point of a gun or whether there’s enough maturity in a Congress that they face this, just like they faced 120 percent debt of GDP back after World War II. You know, we’ve got… BECKY: But these problems — these problems aren’t new. These problems aren’t problems that have built up over decades and there hasn’t been a Congress that’s been mature enough or a president that’s been mature enough to take this head on. BUFFETT: I can — I can— I can end the deficit in five minutes. BECKY: How? BUFFETT: You just pass a law that says that any time there’s a deficit of more than 3 percent of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election. Yeah. Yeah. Now you’ve got the incentives in the right place, right? So it’s capable of being done. And they’re trying to use the incentive now we’re going to blow your brains out, America, you know, in terms of your— of your— in terms of your debt worthiness over time, and that’s being used as a threat. A more effective threat would be just to say if you guys can’t get it done, we’ll get some other guys to get it down. And incidentally, we had— we had Simpson-Bowles, you know, almost eight or 10 months ago. Buffet’s “proposal” to pass a law that says sitting members of Congress can’t seek reelection if the federal deficit is more than 3 percent of GDP immediately went viral. It appears that Buffets quote, or at least a version of Buffet’s quote, was attached to the beginning of a chain email about the 2011 Congressional Reform Act that was already in widespread circulation. However, a representative from Buffet’s Berkshire-Hathaway company later told the Wall Street Journal in an email that Buffet had proposed the “Buffet Rule” to prove a point about the effectiveness good incentives — not to make a serious policy proposal: In an email, a Berkshire spokeswoman said that the company has heard from quite a few people who have received the chain letter, but that (and this is a shocker) Buffett had never suggested someone start one. In fact, the spokeswoman wrote that he never even meant it as a serious proposal and just wanted to emphasize the importance of proper incentives. And CNBC later updated a story on Quick’s interview with Buffet to clarify that his proposal would be extremely difficult to carry out because the very people who would lose their jobs because of it (congressmen) would be the ones who’d have to approve it: An attorney in St. Louis, Jarrad Holst, points out by email that there is a way to enact Buffett’s idea without the cooperation of Congress. Under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, a “Convention for proposing Amendments” is convened when called for by the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. A proposed amendment would then need to be ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the states. If that happens, and it is a very, very big if, Buffett’s deficit plan would become the law of the land. That process would, however, take more than five minutes. And we thoroughly investigated the email’s specific claims about the Congressional Reform Act back in 2011 and found every one of them to be “fiction.” You can read our entire report here. By the end of 2016, however, the rumor was circulating yet again. This time, the exact same points were being attached to the so-called Congressional Reform Act of 2017. So, although emails about the Buffet Rule and the Congressional Reform Act go viral at the beginning of each year, they’re all based on the same claims that are “mostly fiction.” ","Business"
"Ford Moves Manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio after Trump Win-Mostly Fiction!","2016-11-17 08:08:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ford-moves-manufacturing-mexico-ohio-trump-win/"," After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Ford Motor Company announced that it would move its manufacturing operations from Mexico to Ohio. "," Ford has shifted production of some of its trucks from Mexico to Ohio — but the change happened in August 2015, more than a year before Donald Trump was elected president. Various websites re-reported the story to make it appear that Trump’s election had led to Ford shifting production of its full-size F-650 and F-750 trucks from Mexico to a plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. The site Viral Liberty , for example, re-reported the 2015 story under the headline, “Trump Wins the Presidency & Ford Shifts Truck Production from Mexico to Ohio.” However, large portions of that story were lifted from an August 2015 report filed by CNN Money Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. …”Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” But although Ford’s decision to move some of its truck production from Mexico to Ohio didn’t have anything to do with Trump being elected president — Trump was a vocal critic of Ford’s $2.5 billion investment in Mexico back in 2015, and he was credited at the time for shedding light on the issue, the Detroit News reports : Trump, who announced his plans to run at an appearance in New York on Tuesday, vowed to impose 35 percent taxes on imported Ford vehicles and parts coming from the new Mexican plant. Trump said he would call Ford CEO Mark Fields — whom he identified only as “the head of Ford” — to explain the “bad news.” “Let me give you the bad news: every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax — OK? — and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction,” Trump said. “They are going to take away thousands of jobs.” The good news ends there, however. After Trump’s election, Fields said the company would continue its plans to move some of its manufacturing operations to Mexico despite threats by President-elect Trump to impose tariffs, BBC reports : But the Ford boss said a levy on car imports would hurt the US economy. “A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector that could have a major impact on the US economy,” Mr Fields told reporters at the Los Angeles auto show. “I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy,” he said. Ford has previously said it would shift production of its US-produced Focus and C-Max models to a new facility in Mexico by 2018. Mr Fields said on Tuesday it was moving the Focus to make room for two new products in Michigan. He also expressed support for free trade deals like Nafta, echoing comments from BMW chief executive Harald Krueger last week. Given that a 2015 story was re-reported as breaking news after Trump was elected in 2016, and that Ford has said it will continue on with plans to move some manufacturing to Mexico despite Trump’s election, we’re calling this one “fiction.” ","Business"
"PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooya Bashes Donald Trump-Misleading!","2016-11-15 14:26:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pepsico-ceo-indra-nooya-bashes-donald-trump/"," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooya’s comments about Donald Trump, racism and sexism after the 2016 election have led to calls for a boycott of Pepsi products. "," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooya’s comments about Donald Trump and the 2016 presidential election have  been taken out of context. A day after the 2016 presidential election, Nooya appeared at the New York Times Dealbook Conference in Manhattan, and her appearance can be viewed in its entirety here . Bits and pieces of Nooya’s comments have been taken out of context and reframed to make it appear that she was speaking out against Donald Trump’s election, but that’s not necessarily the case. At the start of her appearance, Nooya, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 campaign, was asked how she felt about the results of the election. She replied: Do you have a box of tissues? First of all, I want to congratulate President-elect Donald Trump. Because the election is over, I think we should mourn, for those of us who supported the other side. But we have to come together. Life has to go on. What did I do yesterday? First of all, I had to answer a lot of questions from my daughters, from my employees. They were all in mourning. The question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white, is “are we safe?” Women are asking are we safe? LGBT are asking are we safe? I never thought I would have to answer those questions. So, the first thing we have to do, is to assure everybody in the United States is that they’re safe. Nothing has changed because of this election. What we heard is election talk. We will all come together and unify the country. The process of democracy happened, but we have to go on. Later, the moderator said Trump has used some “coarse language” about women, and he noted that Pepsi is a sponsor of the NFL, which has struggled to address domestic violence issues among its players. Nayoo was asked how those developments might have changed the Pepsi brand or her perspective on public views. She replied: Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare you talk about women that way? … Why do we talk that way about a whole group of citizens that way? I don’t think there’s a place for that kind of language in part of society. Not in locker rooms, not in football player’s homes. Not in any place. If we don’t nip it in the bud, this is going to be a lethal force that’s going to t5ake over society. I think that’s wrong. I hope that in every forum we talk about locker room conversations about women being intolerable …. It’s got to stop. Right-wing and conservative news sites largely took Nooya’s comments out of context and made it appear that she was saying that Trump or his views had to be “nipped in the bud,” when that wasn’t the case. She indirectly condemned comments he made about forcefully grabbing women in a 2010 video, but she never directly condemned Trump. Given all that, we’re calling claims about Pepsi’s CEO speaking out against Trump “misleading.” ","Business"

Bernie Marcus threw his support behind Donald Trump in an editorial published by Real Clear Politics on June 1 under the headline, “Why I Stand with Donald Trump.” In his endorsement of Turmp, Marcus wrote: As a backer of former Republican presidential candidates, I now stand in support of Donald J. Trump because the fate of this nation depends upon sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House. I know Donald Trump, but we’re not close friends. However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn. Like many, I am deeply concerned about the US Supreme Court. When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped. Marcus, who co-founded Home Depot in 1978, added that if he were to try to found the home improvement chain today, he would likely fail because of government regulations. As word of Bernie Marcus’s endorsement of Trump spread across social media, a grassroots effort to boycott Home Depot sprang up among Trump’s critics. Viral posts that listed Marcus as the founder, CEO and chairman of the board for Home Depot were only partially correct, however. Bernie Marcus co-founded Home Depot in 1978, but he retired in 2001 to focus on philanthropy, Forbes reports .

"," A fake news website is behind rumors that Anonymous has released Donald Trump’s tax returns. Free Wood Post published the story under the headline “Anonymous Hacks IRS Database — Publishes Trump’s Tax Records.” The site reported that Anonymous recovered 12 years of Trump’s tax returns and released them to “hundreds of top websites” that published and then removed them within minutes: Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson stated last week that “there has been no year in which Trump paid zero taxes”. In 2012, this was true. He earned $37,746,530, far less that the $400+ million he claims. His final tax burden? Trump didn’t pay $0 in taxes, he actually received a tax refund of $7,832,224. That’s right, he cashed in a 7.8-million dollar tax refund. Recently, Trump stated that “I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.” So, how did Trump “earn” a tax refund? According to his return, he had approximately $37,743,000 in itemized deductions. In addition to massive business write-offs for legal fees relating to his fraudulent Trump “University” and fraudulent real estate transactions, Trump had other more unusual deductions. Trump’s deductions ranged from $118,923 for “Tribble Hair Services” to a $3.8 million dollar write-off for “Anal Bleaching” both listed as an “image expense.” He also made numerous charitable contributions to places like The National Association for the Advancement of White Men and the Trump Fund which provides financial and emotional assistance to wealthy men going through divorce. The Trump family also paid salaries to their numerous employees including, eight chauffeurs, two yacht captains, four pilots for their private jets, two professional dog walkers, one full-time “Tribble stylist” and perhaps most unusual of all a “live-in Hillary Clinton Impressionist” supposedly used for “debate prep”. Of course given the sordid details revealed about Trump’s “Favorite Fantasy Scenario” in the Ashley Madison hack, he likely has other uses for the unfortunate impressionist.

"," There’s no indication that fluctuations in Target’s stock have been triggered by a boycott resulting from the store’s public support of the transgender community. Target announced that it would not change the store’s transgender-friendly policies on bathroom and changing room usage on April 19, and the American Family Association announced a boycott of the store on April 20. By early May, conservative news sites like Breitbart and the Daily Caller were reporting on the impact of AFA’s boycott on Target’s stock prices. Breitbart reported that the boycott had led to a $1.5 billion drop in Target’s market valuation, and the narrative that Target’s stock had plummeted took flight. However, there’s no indication that Target’s stock prices have been impacted by the AFA boycott at all. In fact, a year-over comparison of Target’s stock prices shows that the company had very similar market performance in April 2015 and April 2016, so the company’s market fluctuations during the boycott aren’t unusual. Target opened April 2015 with stock prices at $81.83, and it closed the month at $78.78 — a difference of $3.05, according to Yahoo! Finance historical data : Target opened April 2016 with stock prices at $81.76, and it closed the month at $80.60 — a difference of $1.76: So, Target’s stock actually performed better in April 2016 during the AFA boycott than it performed in April 2015 without it.

"Washington Redskins Owner Dan Snyder Drops “Redskins” from Team Name-Fiction!","2016-04-29 14:09:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-drops-redskins-team-name/"," Rumors are floating around that Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder has dropped “Redskins” from the team’s name because of its racist overtones. "," Dan Snyder has not announced that he’s dropping “Redskins” from his NFL team’s name, and he’s showed no signs of being open to that. The “Redskins” team name has been a source of controversy for years. American Indian tribes and their supporters have called for owner Dan Snyder to change the team’s name — and a MoveOn.org petition sums up their argument: The name “Washington Redskins” is racially derogatory and has no place in today’s culture. For decades, Native Americans have asked the team to choose a different name, and in recent months the movement has gained momentum as major media outlets like the San Francisco Chronicle and Slate Magazine (owned by The Washington Post Company) have decided to stop using the term, as has award-winning Sports Illustrated NFL writer Peter King. Now is the time. Dan Snyder, however, has shot down claims that “Redskin” is a racial slur. He told the Washington Post in 2014 that: “I think you’re going to have some people that feel a certain way, absolutely, and we respect those opinions,” Snyder said. “But I hope they respect our opinion. The respect needs to be mutual, and I hope they do.” Snyder was also asked why he had agreed to an interview about the nickname controversy at all, which is something I had wondered. Snyder’s opinion on the matter is well documented. What more is there to say? “I actually didn’t want to,” Snyder said, laughing. “I don’t know, people think that they need to hear the truth, they need to hear some history, they need to hear the facts. So I said, okay, I’ll tell them.” Snyder returned to the issue of truth later in the interview. “As my father would say, the truth’s on your side,” said Snyder, who stands by the story that George Preston Marshall renamed the team in 1933 to honor its first coach, William ‘Lone Star’ Dietz. “We’ve traveled and we’ve seen the truth. Nobody in Washington, D.C. wants to talk about the truth, so the truth is on our side.” However, Slate relates a different origin for the term “Redskins,” one that’s not as friendly as Snyder’s: In 2005, the Indian language scholar Ives Goddard of the Smithsonian Institution published a remarkable and consequential study of redskin’s early history. His findings shifted the dates for the word’s first appearance in print by more than a century and shed an awkward light on the contemporary debate. Goddard found, in summary, that “the actual origin of the word is entirely benign.” Redskin, he learned, had not emerged first in English or any European language. The English term, in fact, derived from Native American phrases involving the color red in combination with terms for flesh, skin, and man. These phrases were part of a racial vocabulary that Indians often used to designate themselves in opposition to others whom they (like the Europeans) called black, white, and so on. But the language into which those terms for Indians were first translated was French. The tribes among whom the proto forms of redskin first appeared lived in the area of the upper Mississippi River called Illinois country. Their extensive contact with French-speaking colonists, before the French pulled out of North America, led to these phrases being translated, in the 1760s, more or less literally as peau-rouge and only then into English as redskin. It bears mentioning that many such translators were mixed-blood Indians. Half a century later, redskin began circulating. It was used at the White House when President Madison requested that various Indian tribes steer clear of an alliance with Britain. No Ears, a chief of the Little Osages, spoke in reply and one of his statements was translated as, “I know the manners of the whites and the red skins.” Only in 2004, however, when the Papers of James Madison project at the University of Virginia reached the year 1812 did this and another use of redskin from the same meeting come to light. Either way, contrary to reports, Dan Snyder has showed no willingness to change the team’s name — neither has the NFL. That’s why we’re calling this one fiction. ","Business"

"," Target has announced that transgendered customers and employees will be allowed to use their bathroom of choice at Target stores. The retailer issued a statement announcing that it would not change its storewide policy on transgendered bathroom use in states that passed “bathroom laws” that require individuals to use public bathrooms that correspond with their born gender, regardless of how they identify now. In a statement, Target said that it would “continue to stand for inclusivity” by not changing its current policies in those states: April 19, 2016 Recent debate around proposed laws in several states has reignited a national conversation around inclusivity. So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It’s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day. We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination. In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity. We regularly assess issues and consider many factors such as impact to our business, guests and team members. Given the specific questions these legislative proposals raised about how we manage our fitting rooms and restrooms, we felt it was important to state our position. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong. And you’ll always be accepted, respected and welcomed at Target. Last September, Target voiced support for the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to extend legal protections to people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In doing so, Target released a statement about discrimination in the workplace: “Target proudly stands with the LGBT community through all that we do,” says Caroline Wanga, Target’s senior director of diversity and inclusion, “from our partnerships with organizations like the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), to our volunteer efforts, and even the products we sell. We want to be a champion for an inclusive society by using our influence and resources to support equality in the communities where our team members and guests live and work.” This year, Target is also deepening its long-standing support of the HRC by becoming a national platinum partner. This weekend, Target will also be the presenting sponsor of the HRC’s 2015 Twin Cities gala dinner. “Target is helping to lead the fight against discrimination by putting its support behind the Equality Act. Discrimination has no place in the workplace, and Target is demonstrating to all that inclusion is a pillar of any successful business,” says HRC President Chad Griffin. “The time has come for full federal equality, and HRC is proud to include Target as a partner in this fight. Everyone should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live free from fear of discrimination, including Americans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender.” To be clear, Target hasn’t changed its position on gendered bathroom use in any way. The retailer vocally supported the notion in 2007, and it has been consistent ever since. ","Business"
"AAA Warns Motorists Not to Use E15 Gasoline-Outdated!","2016-04-19 13:56:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aaa-warns-motorists-not-use-e15-gasoline/"," AAA has strongly recommended that motorist avoid using E15 or ethanol gasoline in their vehicles. "," Rumors that AAA has warned motorists not use of E15 or ethanol gasoline are mostly outdated and misunderstood. E15 gasoline cannot be used in vehicles that were made before 2001, and AAA warned legislators that consumers had not been properly educated about that back in 2013. That has snowballed into (mostly false) reports that AAA has urged motorists not to use E15. . Flap over gasoline that contains up to 15 percent ethanol, or E15, actually dates back to 2011. That’s when the EPA issued fuel pump labeling and other requirements for E15 gasoline blends. Additionally, the EPA issued waivers under the Clean Air Act that allowed E15 gasoline to be sold for use in cars made in model year 2001 and later. In 2013, AAA President and CEO Robert Darbelnet testified before a congressional committee that sales of E15 should be suspended until stronger consumer protections could be put into place. Specifically, Darbelenet cited inadequate consumer protections and education efforts, as well as the need for additional testing by the National Academy of Sciences, according to an AAA news release : “Congress’ decision to examine potential problems associated with the sale of E15 is encouraging news for motorists,” said Darbelnet. “Most drivers are unaware of the potentially harmful effects of E15 and have not been properly educated about this new fuel entering the market.” “AAA is not opposed to ethanol, but we are against the way E15 has been introduced and sold to consumers,” continued Darbelnet. “We welcome the committee’s support today as AAA calls for additional impartial research and for regulators and industry to suspend the sale of E15 gasoline until motorists are properly educated and protected.” By November 2013, AAA had applauded the EPA’s decision to decrease ethanol requirements, stating “while we would like to increase the use of alternative fuels, it is a plain fact that the Renewable Fuels Standard’s original targets are unreachable without putting motorists and their vehicles at risk.” Given that the EPA heeded AAA’s concerns and decided not to ramp up E15 fuel standards too quickly, the issue should have been laid to rest in 2013 — but that wasn’t to be. AAA found itself in the middle of debate over E15 and the development of alternative fuels. Michael Green, a public relations manager at AAA, clarified that the group was concerned with how the industry had introduced and marketed E15 to consumers — but that AAA was not opposed to E15 in general: Ethanol producers have proposed expanding sales of E15 gasoline to help meet a federal requirement called the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS).  The RFS requires renewable fuels such as ethanol to be blended into gasoline in increasing amounts each year. When Congress passed the law, experts predicted that U.S. gasoline consumption would continue to rise, which would support correspondingly higher ethanol use.  This has proven incorrect as gasoline consumption has remained relatively flat due to more fuel efficient vehicles, a weaker economy and changes in driving habits. The volume of ethanol originally required by law in the Renewable Fuels Standard next year is likely to exceed 10 percent of the fuel supply. Exceeding this level is known as the “blend wall,” given that most gasoline contains 10 percent ethanol. The EPA does not believe it is possible to meet the RFS next year given market and infrastructure limitations with both E15 and E85, and has proposed reducing requirements to avoid the blend wall. So, it’s true that AAA opposed expanding “blend wall” required under Renewable Fuel Standards in 2013 — but it has not opposed E15 or urged motorists not to use it so long as their cars were made after 2001.

"Hobby Lobby Closing All Stores Across the Nation-Fiction!","2016-04-14 14:08:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hobby-lobby-closing-stores-across-nation/"," Rumors are circulating that Hobby Lobby plans to close 500+ retail locations across the country. "," Rumors that Hobby Lobby is closing all stores have been around since 2013, and none of them have proven true. The flap started when Hobby Lobby CEO David Green wrote an open letter about Christian companies being forced to bow to the “sinful” mandates of Obamacare like health plans that require morning after contraception for female employees: But now, our government threatens to change all of that. A new government health care mandate says that our family business must provide what I believe are abortion-causing drugs as part of our health insurance. Being Christians, we don’t pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means that we don’t cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs. It goes against the biblical principles on which we have run this company since day one. If we refuse to comply, we could face $1.3 million per day in government fines. Green continued that he wanted to continue growing the company that he founded and providing jobs, but added that, “the government is forcing us to choose between following our faith and following the law.” The letter immediately sparked questions about whether Green would rather close Hobby Lobby’s 500+ stores instead of complying with a government mandate for contraception that flies in the face of his Christian beliefs. Many of those questions were answered by 2014. Green filed a lawsuit on behalf of Hobby Lobby, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Christian-owned businesses could not be forced to follow a birth control mandate, the Christian Post reports : In a landmark religious freedom case the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Woods Specialties, stating that corporations can refuse to provide certain drugs that may abort a fetus on the basis of religious objection. In a five to four decision, the highest court in the land ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act applies to privately owned businesses like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Woods Specialties. The decision was narrowed to only the contraceptive mandate and is not necessarily applicable to all insurance mandates, like blood transfusions or vaccinations. That seemed to put to rest questions about whether the contraception mandate would force Hobby Lobby to close all of its stores. In fact, the company announced in 2014 that it planned to open 70 new stores across the U.S., according to a press release : The expansion comes amid inaccurate rumors circulating through social media that the company would be closing stores. Hobby Lobby, owned by its founders, David and Barbara Green, and operated according to the family’s deeply held religious convictions, has objected to providing certain contraceptive drugs and devices mandated by the Affordable Care Act despite possible government-induced fines, a decision that may be driving the incorrect rumors. Those “inaccurate rumors” about Hobby Lobby closing were still circulating on social media two years later, but there’s no truth them. These are outdated reports about Hobby Lobby would possibly close all its stores. ","Business"
"Delta Airlines Giving Away Free Tickets-Fiction!","2016-02-02 09:42:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/delta-airlines-giving-away-free-tickets/"," Delta Airlines is giving away free first class tickets to anywhere in the world, as well as $5,000 in spending cash, because January “has been such an amazing month” for the airline. "," Delta Airlines isn’t giving away free first class tickets, or $5,000 in spending cash. That rumor started with a fake Facebook page for Delta Airlines . The page uses the same logo and font as Delta, but the name is spelled “Dalta Airlanes,” a sure sign that this is a hoax. Readers were instructed to “share” the post and to “like” Dalta Airlane’s Facebook page to qualify for a drawing for free tickets that would be held on February 3rd. This appears to be what’s known as a “like farming scam.” Scammers mimic familiar companies and extend fake offers to trick a large number of people into liking a Facebook page. Then, after all those likes make the page more visible to Facebook users, the page is sold for a profit, Consumer Affairs reports: But what is like-farming? Facebook policy forbids it, though of course scammers and con artists by definition tend not to follow the rules. Like-farmers start pages and fill them with content dedicated to collecting as many “likes” or “shares” as possible in the shortest amount of time. Since Facebook’s algorithms place a high value on popularity (as measured by likes and shares), these highly liked and shared pages therefore have a much higher chance of appearing in people’s “Feeds” and being seen by other Facebook users. Then, once the page has a sufficiently high popularity rating, the like-farmer either removes the page’s original content and replaces it with something else (usually malware or scam advertising); leaves the page as is and uses it as a platform for continued like-farming in order to spread malware, collect people’s marketing information or engage in other harmful activities; or outright sells the highly liked site to cybercriminals in a black market web forum. Anytime you see an offer for free products and services, make sure that it’s coming from the company’s official Facebook page. In this case, “Dalta Airlanes” can easily be identified as an imposter, but differences can be more sublte, too. Also, remember that most reputable companies would never ask you to give out personal information over Facebook. If you’re asked to do so, be on the look out for scammers. ","Business"
"Dubai Doesn’t Have a Sewer System- Previously Truth! Now Resolved!","2016-01-27 13:43:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dubai-doesnt-have-a-sewer-system/","(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Dubai Doesn’t Have a Sewer System- Previously Truth! Now Resolved! Summary of the eRumor: The United Arab Emirates city of Dubai was developed without a sewer system so trucks are brought in carry away human waste. "," Reports that Dubai doesn’t have a sewer system and that raw sewage has to be tucked to treatment plants were once true, but the issue was resolved by 2013 Dubai’s sewage controversy started in 2009. A YouTube video showing a long line of tankers transporting human waste out of Dubai for treatment at a plant went viral early that year. Then, ABC News reported that despite being “filthy rich,” Dubai suffered from E. coli outbreaks because much of the city wasn’t connected to a sewer system. Raw sewage was being dumped into storm drains instead of being trucked to treatment plants: Along with being gross and a health hazard, the sewage problem advertises a city that has grown faster than its infrastructure. As Dubai’s population has boomed and its skyline expanded on a tremendous scale at great speed, some basic city needs suffer apparent neglect. Dr. Mohammad Raouf, an environmental economist based in Dubai, confirmed the Times Online report. He says the sewage dumping does happen and that it is a problem of capacity. “Here is the main problem I believe: we grow very fast without taking into consideration all possible negative impacts,” he told me, adding that the mega-real estate projects along the waterfront don’t help. Within a few years, however, Dubai city planners said that its sewer system had caught up with the fast pace of city development, according to a 2011 report from Gulf Today : A NUMBER of newly developed areas in Dubai, including locations around Sheikh Zayed Road, Business Bay, Dubai Marina and Aweer have been linked to the main sewage network of the city. Dubai Municipality (DM) claims that the delivery of sewerage services has been ensured in the entire areas of the city with the completion of the several new projects, including the establishment of a giant sewage water treatment plant at Jebel Ali at an estimated cost of Dhs1.55 billion. Talib Julfar, the director of Drainage and Irrigation Department at the DM, said that new plant, second phase of which was completed in 2010, would be the main sewage treatment plant for the city in place of the current Al Aweer plant. “An odour treatment plant was also set up to prevent emission of unpleasant stench affecting the surrounding areas,” he added. “The waste water treatment plant, spanning over an area of 670 hectares of land, has a capacity of processing 300,000 cubic metres per day, 150,000 cubic metres for each phase,” elaborated Julfar. “Giant sewage pumping stations and pipelines, including a project at an estimated cost of Dhs580 million have been set up to transfer sewage from Dubai’s different areas to the plant and transfer treated irrigation water to various locations in the city,” he noted. Before oil reserves were discovered in Dubai in 1966, it was nothing more than a port town and market. In 1971, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah joined together to create the United Arab Emirates, one of the richest countries in the world, according to UAE’s official website : In the 1980s and early 1990s, Dubai took a strategic decision to emerge as a major international-quality tourism destination. Investments in tourism infrastructure have paid off handsomely over the years. Dubai is now a city that boasts unmatchable hotels, remarkable architecture and world-class entertainment and sporting events. The beautiful Burj Al Arab hotel presiding over the coastline of Jumeira beach is the world’s only hotel with a seven star rating. The Emirates Towers are one of the many structures that remind us of the commercial confidence in a city that expands at a remarkable rate. Standing 350 meters high, the office tower is the tallest building in the Middle East and Europe. The fast pace of Dubai’s (and the rest of the UAE’s) development brought growing pains, including the sewage woes from this rumor. By all accounts, however, Dubai implemented city-wide sewer systems years ago. ","Business"
"Saudi Billionaire Buys Buford, Wyoming, to Build Mecca-Fiction!","2016-01-27 13:11:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/saudi-billionaire-buys-buford-wyoming-to-build-mecca/"," A Saudi billionaire purchased the entire town of Buford, Wyoming, and has hired the Binladen Group to build a “Western Mecca” that will ban non-Muslims. "," Reports that a Saudi billionaire purchased Buford, Wyoming, and hired the Bin Laden family’s construction firm to build a “Western Mecca” were drudged up by a fake news website. Real News Right Now published a story in November 2015 under the headline, “Saudi Billionaire Begins Construction of ‘Western Mecca’ in Wyoming.” Sheikh Mohammed Kamel Alsaud bought the small town for $1.8 billion to fulfill his “lifelong dream of bringing Islam to America,” the story reports: Alsaud has hired the Binladen Group, a Saudi Arabian construction company founded in 1931 by Mohammed Bin Laden, to develop the $650 million project. Dubbed the ‘Mecca of the West’ by Shiekh Alsaud, the site is designed to replicate the original Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad and the most sacred site in the Islamic faith, located in Hejaz, Saudi Arabia. Like the original holy city, only Muslims are permitted access to the ‘Mecca of the West.’ However, Alsaud told Forbes, “Our non-Muslim patrons will have the option to view the holy shrine using high-end telescopes installed at way-points around the perimeter.” The telescopes, according to Alsaud, are pay-per-view and cost $15 to operate. “A fair price in comparison to that which our Muslim brothers and sisters will pay to make their annual pilgrimage to Buford,” Alsaud said. At the time, the story didn’t gain much traction. That’s probably because Real News Right Now is notorious for publishing fake news articles with a radical right-wing bend. The site doesn’t clearly identify itself as satire, but reading between the lines of its “ About ” page tells the story. Its credits include the Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity (Glass is a disgraced journalist who fabricated stories) and the Oscar Mayer Award for Journalistic Excellence (Oscar Mayer is the world’s foremost purveyor of bologna). The false report about a Saudi billionaire’s plans to build a “Western Mecca” in Buford, Wyoming, resurfaced in January 2016 when the story appeared at Before Its News , a website that publishes user-generated content “as is.” This time, it gained more traction. This rumor is a classic example of a fake news story using a kernel of truth to dupe its readers. In this case, the kernel of truth is the odd town of Buford, Wyoming. The town lies on about 10 acres and includes one convenience store, gas station and a modular home. Don Sammons, the town’s mayor and only resident, auctioned Buford off in 2012. An unidentified Vietnamese businessman bought Buford for $900,000, completing his dream of “owning a piece of property in the U.S,” Reuters reports . Buford’s buyer was later identified as Nguyen Dinh Pham, a 38-year old Vietnamese businessman who “distributes home- and personal-care brands in Vietnam.” By 2013, Dinh Pham was working toward making Buford “the face of a new Vietnamese coffee company,” the New Yorker reports : Now, as drivers approach Exit 335 on I-80, they see billboards announcing the town’s rebranded name: PhinDeli Town Buford. (Officially, the town will remain Buford.) In one of the signs, a photo of Sammons has been replaced with an image of Nguyen, with his arms folded, wearing sunglasses. The other billboards show Nguyen and Sammons shaking hands and holding up a T-shirt, consummating the town’s handover. Other than that, little has changed so far in Buford. Nguyen’s marketing plan is predicated on the town’s enduring charm. Tourists can still pose in front of the population marker, which will remain at one; after the town’s relaunch, Nguyen planned to return to Saigon, where he lives with his wife and two children, but a caretaker will occupy Sammons’s old house. Two employees will work at the store and gas pumps. The convenience store, in addition to selling PhinDeli Town Buford trinkets, will now sell bags of PhinDeli coffee. Visitors can try samples while seated at a new coffee counter; on the wall behind it, a ten-foot painted mural illustrates PhinDeli’s manufacturing process in Vietnam. So, Buford has a colorful past as the only town in the U.S. with a population of one, but reports that it’s been purchased by a Saudi for a billion dollars have been totally fabricated. ","Business"

"Burger King Follows Sharia Law, Bans Bacon-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-12-18 10:39:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/burger-king-follows-sharia-law-bans-bacon/"," Reports that Burger King has pulled bacon and other non-halal products in a nod to Islamic Sharia Law has led to calls for a boycott of the burger chain. "," Burger King has operated halal restaurants in predominately Muslim areas for years, and there wasn’t any indication that the burger chain planned to dramatically change course when this rumor went viral in December 2015. It has been reported in French media, however, that Burger King plans to add about 20 halal restaurants in Europe after acquiring Quick, a Belgian burger chain. That sparked rumors that Burger King planned to go “all halal” and calls to boycott the restaurant for supporting the “Islamificiation” of the west. Those rumors started after Political Insider published an article headlined, “Burger King Just Announced THEY WILL FOLLOW ISLAMIC SHARIA LAW! – Stop Them!” The article, which was published in mid-December 2015, reports : Burger King has caved to the pressure from Islam, and they just made an announcement that they will ONLY serve 100% halal meat, under the rules of Sharia Law. The announcement comes from their chains in France, which is the same country that recently suffered from a deadly Islamic terrorist attack just one month ago. This rule also means their French stores won’t serve bacon or chicken… The Islamification of the West is spreading, and they are demanding we all live by their rules! The claim that Burger King had just announced that it will “only serve 100% halal meat” is false. In reality, Burger King has acquired the Quick burger chain (which already had 20 halal restaurants) and it planned to add about 20 more halal locations, French news site The Local reports : This means all bacon and pork-based meals will be scrapped from the menu and all the beef and chicken used will be certified halal. The move is understood to be part of Burger King’s continued attempt to take on McDonald’s – the behemoth of the French fast food world with around 1,300 stores. Quick already has around 20 halal restaurants in France, where all the meat used comes from animals slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. Despite calls to boycott Burger King after right-wing American blog sites picked up on the story, the idea that Burger King plans to operate 100% halal restaurants isn’t “breaking” news. The burger chain has operated halal restaurants in predominately Muslim areas of the world for years. There are three all-halal Burger King locations in Malaysia, for example . Also, in 2014, Burger King made waves when it brought a beef and pork free Whopper to India to cater to both Muslims and Hindus. The burger chain introduced a Chicken Whopper, a Mutton Whopper and a Vegetable Whopper there. So, in conclusion, it’s true that Burger King plans to open about 20 new halal restaurants in Europe (but it’s not clear whether or not they will all be in France). But reports that Burger King will “only serve 100% halal meat” have misled people into believing that the burger chain is making dramatic changes, and that’s not the case. ","Business"

A customer at a Buffalo Wild Wings location in Lubbock, Texas, tweeted a photo of receipt with a $1.12 charge listed for “FL Surcharge Afford Care”: The Obamacare surcharge was implemented a handful of restaurants owned by the Howard Restaurant Group in Lubbock, Texas — not across the entire franchise. A spokesperson for the Howard Restaurant Group explained in a statement that the Obamacare surcharge was intended to cover additional expenses for full-time employees under the Affordable Care Act: “Due to the Affordable Healthcare Act and its requirement of healthcare coverage to all full-time employees, our restaurant group has decided instead of cutting employee hours and raising food and beverage prices, to implement a two percent surcharge on all guest checks to offset the cost of the federally mandated employee healthcare with the least possible impact to the consumer,” Samantha Spitzer, director of marketing for Howard Restaurant Group, said in a statement.

On November 3, 2015, Chipotle announced that it would temporarily close 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington because of an “E. coli incident.” A total of 39 people in the Pacific Northwest had been hospitalized after being exposed to E. coli while dining at Chipotle, a local ABC News affiliate in Washington State reported . A week later, on November 10, Chipotle announced that it had concluded an investigation into the E. coli outbreak and reopened all 43 restaurants in Washington and Oregon. Meat served at 11 of the restaurants tested positive for E. coli. The company said that no known cases had been reported at restaurants outside of the Pacific Northwest. In the meantime, false reports that Chipotle was closing all of its restaurants because of E. coli contamination, or because it had been discovered that Chipotle serves dog and cat meat, swept across the Internet. The fake news website Huzlers was behind a false report that Chipotle had closed 60 restaurants because of an E. coli outbreak related to Chipotle’s use of dog and cat meat: It is being reported that the popular restaurant chain ‘Chipotle Mexican Grill’, more commonly known as simply ‘Chipotle’, is currently being investigated for allegedly using dog and cat meat in their dishes causing the E. coli outbreak. The FDA suspected the chain was using dog and cat meat when an FDA inspector stumbled upon multiple live dogs and cat, as well as dog and cat corpses in one Chipotle factory located in Denver. The inspector notified the authorities and the factory was shut down. The FDA will soon force all Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. to prevent people from consuming dog and cat meat.

"," Some Cadbury (and many other) products are labeled as certified halal, but claims that those who buy the products are supporting terrorism are false. The forwarded email first surfaced in 2009. A consumer in Australia who found a halal certification symbol “hidden” on a Cadbury product’s packaging wrote the email: I checked out Cadbury today at Woolworths!!! No more Cadbury’s for me!!! I will check everything from now on… It is also on my Bega Cheese. This is absolute fact. Before Lorraine went shopping Monday I showed her this email. She looked at the products in the shop mentioned and they had the symbol hidden on the back of the packaging and in a very weak colour that was hard to see… That claim is true, but it’s misleading to suggest that the company has “hidden” the fact that some of its products are certified halal. Cadbury lists more than 75 products as certified halal on its website. Then the forwarded email goes on to suggest that Cadbury pays the Halal Certification Authority for use of the certified halal symbol, and that the money “may” be used to support terrorism: This is a Muslim Association that collects money from the Australian Food Industry for this symbol so that Muslims will purchase the product. Yet we are told the Muslim population are only one and a half percent of Australia’s total! On a recent radio talk-back show a well known host was alerted to this practice. He hit a stone wall when trying to find out HOW MUCH money was paid to this organization and WHERE the money went. That claim mirrors a larger movement against certified halal products that has been taking place in Australia in recent years. Social media campaigns have called for the boycott of companies that produce certified halal products, and a Change.org petition to “ban the forced halal certification being imposed on all Australians.” There are a number of problems with these claims. First, halal certification is not “being imposed on all Australians.” Individual companies decide whether or not to make halal products, and whether or not to get third-party groups to certify halal product claims, according to the Australian Food and Grocery Council : It is up to the manufacturer whether or not to make a halal claim for a particular product. A manufacturer can also claim that a food is halal without the claim needing to be certified (the Australian Consumer Law prohibits any false, misleading or deceptive claims). Certification simply provides third party assurance that the claim is valid. It is up to manufacturers to decide whether the marketing benefits of certification outweigh the costs. The forwarded email also claims that companies are catering to Muslims even though they make up less than 2% of the country’s population. However, the Halal Certification Authority allows companies to label certified halal products for sale in Australia, the Americas, Asia and Europe. Overall, the certification allows companies to reach “one fifth of the Muslim population worldwide,” so the market extends well beyond Australia. Companies that do choose to label certified halal products typically pay an annual licensing fee to use the certification logo, an ABC affiliate in Australia reports : Processed food companies, who generally pay a set yearly fee for halal certification, were more willing to talk, but few would disclose exactly what this costs. The Byron Bay Cookie Company said its annual halal certification fee was around $1,500 a year. This represented about 0.003 per cent of its total cost of doing business, a spokesman told Fact Check. Geoff Hutchinson, a director of the Fleurieu Milk Company, which forfeited a $50,000 contract to supply yoghurt to Emirates airlines after a sustained anti-halal social media campaign, says halal certification for the contract cost about $1,000, or two per cent of the contract. A spokeswoman for Nestle said the fees the company paid were negligible in the context of its total business. “They do not influence the price at which we sell our products. We don’t pass this cost on,” she said. And authorities in Australia have investigated claims that licensing fees for certified halal product logos have been used to support terrorism, and no proof has been found, the Australian Crime Commission reports : The Australian Crime Commission-led Eligo National Task Force is focused on the use of the alternative money remittance sector and other informal value transfer systems (IVTS) by serious and organised crime. The task force has identified direct links between serious and organised crime, money laundering and terrorism funding. However, the Australian Crime Commission is not aware of any direct links between the legitimate halal certification industry and money laundering or the financing of terrorist groups. Anyone with information about money laundering or the financing of terrorist activity is encouraged to contact the Australian Crime Commission or the National Security Hotline on 1800 1234 00. Finally, arguments against halal certification labeling often center on the idea that companies produce halal products to be politically correct, or to please a small minority of Muslim customers. That’s not the case. Companies produce halal products because of market forces. The global halal food market is expected to be worth $3.9 trillion by 2019 , and companies want to tap into that market. ","Business"

"," It’s true that SAM’s Club is offering free memberships to new moms through a limited promotion — but there are a number of catches. After word got out that SAM’s Club was offering free memberships to new and expecting mothers in September, “mom blogs” and websites like Coupon Pro urged shoppers to take advantage: Like most promotions, however, this one has a number of catches. That created some confusion because the wholesaler posted information about the free membership for new moms offer in a “ members-only ” section of its website that’s not available to the general public. Many took to Facebook with questions about the offer, and SAM’s Club directed them to send their contact info to the company in a private message to proceed with the offer: As it turns out, the free membership offer is valid for moms with children who are 12 months old or younger, and for expecting mothers who can show proof of pregnancy. There’s no word on how long the free membership for new moms offer will last, but it’s likely offered only during the wholesaler’s “ Baby Month ” in September. Typically, SAM’s Club memberships cost $45 per year for a basic plan, or $100 per year for a “plus” membership plan that has added perks like earlier shopping hours and product protection plans.

"Johnson & Johnson Removes Formaldehyde from Baby Products-Truth!","2015-09-21 14:00:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/johnson-johnson-removes-formaldehyde-from-baby-products-truth/"," Johnson & Johnson has removed formaldehyde from baby products like No More Tears shampoo. "," Johnson & Johnson removed formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from its baby products back in 2014. Susan Nettesheim, the vice president of product stewardship and toxicology at Johnson & Johnson, wrote in a 2012 blog post that the company would reformulate its baby products due to consumer concerns over ingredients: Over the past few years, some interest groups have raised questions about the ingredients in personal care products used widely around the world, and they’ve put particular focus on our baby products. At first we were disappointed, because we know that all our products are safe by scientific standards and meet or exceed government regulations. Over time, though, we’ve come to realize that sometimes safety alone isn’t enough. There’s a vigorous public discussion going on around the world about what ingredients should or shouldn’t be in personal care products, and how they should be regulated. We have a point of view that we’ve expressed, based on our considered understanding of the science involved, and that’s always going to be our starting point. But what matters most isn’t what we think, it’s what the people who use our products think. Johnson and Johnson didn’t directly add formaldehyde to its baby products, however. Rather, the company used formaldehyde-releasing ingredients like the ammonia salt quaternium-15 to extend the shelf life of many consumer products, including baby shampoo. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and other consumer groups lauded Johnson & Johnson’s decision to remove these formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from baby products as a “major victory for public health.” However, some toxicology experts have dismissed concerns about formaldehyde-releasing ingredients in baby shampoo as form of hysteria. After all, it’s a naturally-occurring chemical that our own bodies produces, Slate reports : The concern about formaldehyde in personal care products reveals a bit ofchemophobia, which Dartmouth chemistry professor Gordon Gribble defines as “an irrational fear of chemicals based on ignorance of the facts.” He says, “people don’t know how small molecules are, and they believe that single molecules of some chemical pose a health threat.” That’s exactly the concern EWG expressed. “The actual molecule formaldehyde itself is the carcinogen,” says Johanna Congleton, toxicologist and senior scientist at EWG. “It doesn’t matter if it’s in a liquid or if you’re inhaling particles with formaldehyde.” In fact, the only studies that link formaldehyde to cancer are related to humans inhaling it, and inhaling large amounts of it. Funeral industry professionals with more than 34 years of experience or who had performed more than 500 embalmings and factory workers who spent years working around formaldehyde before the 1990s had higher risks for leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The amount of exposure required to cause cancer is so high that other studies of factory workers have been inconclusive. Formaldehyde occurs naturally in common fruits and vegetables (even organic ones). “Unless people calling for removal of quaternium-15 are also keeping their children from eating apples and french fries,” Hartings says, “I think their activism might be misplaced.” Our own bodies create formaldehyde as a normal byproduct during amino acid synthesis and overall metabolism, including breaking down antibiotics and other medications. It’s also in drinking water and the air we breathe. Homer Swei, a scientist at Johnson & Johnson, points out that 90 percent of the formaldehyde around us is naturally occurring, with 60 percent of that coming from plants and trees, yet it’s still perfectly fine to walk through the woods. Further, the formaldehyde in synthetic or manufactured products is no different in terms of chemical structurethan naturally occurring formaldehyde—it’s all CH2O. Nevertheless, Johnson & Johnson elected to remove formaldehyde-releasing ingredients from baby shampoo (and many other products) because of consumer fears. By early 2014, Johnson & Johnson had reformulated many products, the New York Times reports : In doing so, the company is navigating a precarious path, investing tens of millions of dollars to remove the chemicals while at the same time insisting that they are safe. The company is responding, executives said, to a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, as an increasingly informed public demands that companies be more responsive to their concerns, especially when it comes to the ingredients in their products. The complex effort carries both risks and rewards for the health care giant — it requires difficult re-engineering of some of Johnson & Johnson’s most beloved brands, but success in the marketplace could serve as a much-needed boost to a company that has been battered by a series of embarrassing quality lapses and product recalls. In addition to reformulating many of its products, Johnson & Johnson also created a new website to provide consumers with information about its ingredients. Click here for that website. ","Business"

"," Dunkin’ Donuts has not filed for bankruptcy, and it’s not closing any shops. That rumor was started by a “prank news” website called FCX News Online. A link to the story appeared on social media sites with the luring headline, “Dunkin’ Donuts Declares Bankruptcy: Closing All Stores by Late November.” When social media users click through to the story, however, they’re greeted by a pop-up that says, “You Got Punked!”: Within days of being posted, nearly 850,000 social media users had been “punked” by false reports of Dunkin’ Donuts’ demise. In reality, the opposite was happening to Dunkin’ Donuts when the story went viral. The donut chain, which is owned by Baskin Robbins, has shifted into growth mode and is adding locations in the U.S. and around the world, Quartz reports : The strange expansion pattern means the Dunkin’ Donuts brand is still heavily identified with the US Northeast. And while the supremacy of iced coffee there has given the chain a huge trend to tap into—any time of year—Dunkin’ can’t survive on the irrational preferences of New Englanders alone. That’s why the chain is making major efforts to expand nationally and internationally in 2015. And it’s doing so even where it means deviating from its well-worn menu of pastries and caffeinated beverages—in some cases, radically rebranding the whole Dunkin’ Donuts concept according to the locale. Despite recent misses (paywall) against sales forecasts, Nigel Travis, CEO of Dunkin’ Brands (the parent company of Dunkin’ Donuts and the Baskin Robbins ice cream chain) has been optimistic on earnings calls and in press interviews about long-term growth built on new products and new locations around the world. Right now there are more than 11,000 Dunkin’ Donuts shops in 33 countries. Travis has said he eventually wants 17,000 in the US alone, and 30,000 outlets total(including Baskin Robbins locations) around the world. So, the rumor that Dunkin’ Donuts has filed for bankruptcy and will close all its locations by late November couldn’t be further from the truth. ","Business"

Chick-fil-A has been closed on Sundays ever since the first restaurant opened back in the 1940s, and that’s not going to change anytime soon. The company has explained the policy on its website: Thanks for asking. Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. He believed that all franchised Chick-fil-A Operators and Restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest and spend time with family and friends. That’s why all Chick-fil-A Restaurants are closed on Sundays. It’s part of our recipe for success. That being said, we will continue to remain closed on Sundays.

"," This one is true. News first broke that Disney had fired 250 IT employees at Disney World and Disney Land in October 2014. Disney said in a statement that the firings were due to “restructuring our global technology organization to support future innovation and new capabilities.” As part of the restructuring, Disney reportedly told the 250 fired employees that they had 90 days to reapply for new jobs with the theme park. But those employees were actually hired to train their replacement, the New York Times reports : “Instead, about 250 Disney employees were told in late October that they would be laid off. Many of their jobs were transferred to immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers, who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India. Over the next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had lost.” The replacements were brought in from India under the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ H-1B visa program . The program allows people from other countries with advanced degrees in high-demand fields to apply for an H-1B visa to come to America. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) called for a Senate investigation into the matter in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Nelson said the program was created to “help fill jobs when there were labor shortages, not take jobs away from anyone.” To make matters worse for the fired Disney employees, they said a number of employers in the area said they couldn’t hire Disney employees until a year after their termination. Disney said it doesn’t have such a policy in place. ","Business"

"," Taco Bell doesn’t plan to close all its restaurants by summer 2015. That false claim was started by a website called Prank.Link . The website, which used to be called Feed Newz , allows users to create their own fake news stories to “prank” their friends. The website boasts that the false report about Taco Bell closing all of its restaurants by summer 2015 had “trolled” 522,660 people on social media sites. This isn’t the first time that reports of Taco Bell closing all of its restaurants went viral. Back in 2011, the infamous fake news publication Weekly World News reported that the restaurant would “close its doors for good” after allegations of false advertising: “After allegations of false advertising, further investigation causes Taco Bell to close its doors for good. Taco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general,  has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement. On Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef. The majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself. Weekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations. It did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.” The disclaimer for Weekly World News says that all information on the website is presented “as is” without any guarantees of quality, accuracy, adequacy, completeness and correctness. When false reports that Taco Bell would close all of its restaurants first surfaced back in 2011, the chain had been sued over allegations that it had falsely advertised that its menu items contained real beef. The lawsuit was dismissed after Taco Bell changed its marketing strategies and disclosed more information about the “beef product” that it uses, NPR reports . ","Business"

"," This is an old scam that has resurfaced in May 2015. The scam first surfaced in 2011 when Facebook and Twitter users received a message that said, “Receive 2 FREE Southwest Airline Tickets Today!” Southwest Airlines addressed it in a statement then: “We are aware of the Facebook scam asking you to write on our wall to win free tickets. This is not something hosted by Southwest. We have already reported it and are working as quickly as possible to get to the bottom of it. Sorry for any inconvenience!” The Southwest Airlines scam has also been known to appear in the comments section of Facebook posts. These comments, which may be posted by a friend or family member whose account has been hacked, can be especially deceiving. In this case, one example provides a link and reads, “Awesome! I just picked up my 2 complementary tickets from Southwest Airlines to fly anywhere I want to! Did NOT trust that it would be true, but it was …” This fake offer for fee airline tickets is what’s called a survey scam. This type of scam asks its victims to take part in a brief survey in exchange for some type of reward, like free airline tickets. However, when users click on the link, they’ll often find that they’re asked to give out personal information, according to the FTC : “The personal information is then used against the citizen to commit fraud. For instance, in telephone cramming schemes, a crammer can charge a person’s phone bill for unauthorized products simply by knowing the person’s name and phone number. Or, the scammer may use knowledge obtained during the survey to gain credibility with the consumer. For example, the surveyor may ask the consumer where he banks. Two months later, the scammer may call the citizen back, pose as his bank, tell him there were fraudulent charges against his bank account, and ask for his account number to stop the fraud. Many people list their phone numbers on the federal ‘Do Not Call’ list. This restricts telemarketers’ ability to call the household. Under federal law, legitimate surveyors may call phone numbers on the Do Not Call registry. Some telemarketers pose as surveyors to try to sidestep the Do Not Call laws. Fourth, scammers use surveys to obtain a person’s financial information. For instance, some surveyors tell people they will pay them money if they participate in a survey. The surveyor puts up a phony survey and, at the end of the email or call, asks the citizen for their bank account number so they can send the survey payment. The surveyor uses the account number to post phony charges on the consumer’s account.” ","Business"

"Walmart Closes 5 Stores Because of Plumbing Issues, Speculation Ensues-Truth! & Unproven!","2015-04-20 12:56:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/walmart-closes-5-stores-because-of-plumbing-issues-speculation-ensues/"," Walmart said it had closed five stores in one day to fix plumbing problems, which sparked speculation that the stores were closed for other reasons. "," All we know for certain is that Walmart said it closed five stores in mid-April of 2015 to fix plumbing problems. Conspiracy theories about the “real” reasons Walmart closed its stores have run rampant, but they’re nothing more than conspiracy theories at this point. Walmart closed the stores on April 13, 2015, without advance notice. It said that it would take about six months to fix plumbing problems before they would reopen. The stores were located in California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas. A Walmart spokesperson told the Consumerist : “Our goal, of course, as a business is to keep our stores open and serving customers. We made a tough business decision in five locations around the country to fix recurring plumbing problems in these stores. We understand this decision has been difficult on our associates and our customers and we aim to reopen these stores as soon as these issues are resolved and improvements are made.” But county officials, contractors and store employees have cast doubts about Walmart’s “plumbing problems.” WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida, reported that there were no code or permit violations at a store in Brandon, Florida, that closed: “Walmart is claiming plumbing problems are to blame and the store would reopen in six months. But Walmart plumbing technician Codi Bauer tells 8 On Your Side he is suspicious. “‘Even if they had to replace the whole sewer line, it wouldn’t take six months to replace a whole sewer line in that store,’ he said. “The company also told Hillsborough County Commissioner Victor Crist something different. “’No [the Walmart official] didn’t mention anything about plumbing. He just said repairs and updates to the store,’ Crist said. “A separate letter sent to the county claims the layoffs are permanent.” And there weren’t any permits taken out for large-scale plumbing projects at any of the five stores, an ABC affiliate reports . Those apparent inconsistencies and unanswered questions about Walmart’s so-called plumbing problems have led to widespread speculation. A Walmart employee from the Pico Rivera Walmart in California speculated that the store had been closed because of labor issues there, a CBS affiliate reports : “Seven-year Walmart worker Venanzi Luna says the Pico Rivera location has been a hotbed for worker activism and some are skeptical thinking the company may be targeting employees who have spoken out. “As a longtime member of the Organization United for Respect (OUR) at Walmart, a group funded by the Food Workers Union, Luna has led strikes and sit-ins to fight for higher wages.” Another theory was that the stores had been closed because of a planned multi-state military exercise called Jade Helm 15. Click here for a previous TruthorFiction.com story on that. That theory doesn’t necessarily make sense, however, because the exercise wasn’t scheduled to take place in Florida or Oklahoma, where two closed Walmart stores were closed. Others have speculated that the Walmart stores would be turned into FEMA camps, but there’s no proof of that, either. TruthorFiction.com has reached out to Walmart for comment. Future updates will be posted here. ","Business"
