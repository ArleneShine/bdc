"Obama Crushed as Trump Ends Prayer Rug Tradition-Fiction!","2016-12-12 12:26:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-crushed-as-trump-ends-prayer-rug-tradition/"," President Obama was crushed after President-elect Donald Trump ordered an end to “the sickest tradition,” an Islamic prayer ritual. "," A fake news website is behind false reports that President Obama was crushed after President-elect Donald Trump ended secretive Muslim prayer rituals at the White House The hoax story appeared at a website identifying itself as “The Resistance” and making clear in its “About Us” section that information in its stories “may or may not be reliable” in December 2016. The story, which appears under the the headline, “Obama Crushed After Trump Orders White House to Top His Sickest Tradition,” begins: Obama was seen storming away from the West Wing after staffers from Donald Trump’s transition team began preparing the Executive offices for the new administration. On Trump’s orders, one of Obama’s most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. For the past 7 years, to appease any Muslims working at or visiting the White House, silence has been ordered during the five times of Islamic prayer each day. In addition, prayer rugs and crescent moon symbols are available in several areas of the executive mansion to make Muslims more comfortable. The administration has defended the practice by asserting that it also observes several other religious moments of silence and prayer out of respect, including a full 15 seconds for Christianity on Sunday morning while a chaplain blesses a staff breakfast. None of the prayer is mandatory or led by a government official, which has allowed the administration to subvert 1st Amendment issues, but the obvious favoritism towards Islam, which is observed for 25 minutes per day seven days a week, tells a story this president has denied for eight years. President-Elect Trump, who acknowledges that this country was founded by Christians and was built on Christian morals, is having all pagan symbols removed from the property unless they offer some historical significance. Only the cross in the White House chapel will remain for worship. Jim Mergernerlerny, head of the team that will transform the White House from the Obama’s home to the Trump’s second home, told MSNBC: “Mr. Trump doesn’t see the need to provide prayer rugs and false idols is a house built by Christians. Washington DC offers a diverse cultural center for worship of any kind. You won’t find any special considerations for Judaism or crucifixes to appease Catholics, either. There is a simple chapel with a single cross on one wall that is suitable for prayer by anyone. Our government doesn’t need to be forcing prayer rituals down people’s throats just so we don’t ‘offend’ people looking to blow us up.” The story falls in line with a long-running rumor that President Obama had installed Muslim prayer rugs at the White House and ordered silence daily during the Islamic call to prayer at the White House. Those (false) rumors were based on social media post by human rights attorney Qasim Rashid. Rashid posted video images of himself and others praying during a special event at the White House in July 2016. That led to false reports that Obama had special Muslim prayer rugs installed and ordered silence during daily Islamic prayers at the White House — both baseless claims. So, claims that Obama was crushed by Trump ending his “sickest tradition” are false and based on earlier false rumors. ","Obama"
"Muslim TSA Officer Frisks Nun at Airport-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-08 09:04:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/muslim-tsa-officer-frisks-nun-airport/"," A photo showing a Muslim TSA agent with a head covering frisking a nun at an airport has sparked comments like “Only in Obama’s America” and “Only in Hillary’s America.” "," This photo of a TSA agent wearing a hijab frisking a nun at the airport is real. But claims that the picture summarizes President Obama’s or Hillary Clinton’s policies or principles when it comes to Muslims or religion in general don’t check out. The photo was taken in 2007, while President George W. Bush was in office. A private photographer named Chris Davis took the photo in 2007 Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Davis posted the photo on his Flickr account with the caption: This was captured as I collected my things from airport security (Detroit Metro Concourse A). I think of it as something like a Rorschach test. Is an elderly Catholic nun being frisked by a Muslim security agent the celebration of blind justice? Or is it simply an admission of absurdity? The photo didn’t gain much attention at the time. However, Drudge Report featured the photo on its website in 2010 under the headline, “The Terrorists Have Won.” Since then, it’s resurfaced from time to time over the course of Obama’s presidency. And the idea that an elderly nun would be stopped and frisked by a TSA officer at an airport check point has sparked plenty of outrage online  — but there’s another side the story. First, anyone wearing bagging clothes faces extra scrutiny and screening at airport checkpoints because baggy clothes makes it easier to conceal things. Travel experts have said as much going as far back as 2010. Second, it wouldn’t be smart to make it known that anybody dressed as a nun won’t face screening at an airport. That would signal that anyone woman — even terrorists — could simply dress as nuns and breeze through security check points. So, this is a real photo that was taken at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in 2007. Attempts to tie the photo to Obama or Clinton policies, however, don’t add up. Beside that, the idea that anyone dressed as a nun shouldn’t be screened at airport checkpoints is also faulty logic. ","Obama"
"Released from Prison by Obama, Wendell Callahan Killed 3 People-Mostly Fiction!","2016-09-07 10:46:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/released-prison-obama-wendell-callahan-killed-3-people/"," Wendell Callahan, a man who was serving time on crack-cocaine charges, murdered his ex-girlfriend and her two children after President Obama gave him early release. "," The tragic details of this case are true — but Wendell Callahan was released due to reforms in federal prison sentencing guidelines, not because Obama pardoned him. Callahan was charged with three counts of aggravated murder in January 2016 for allegedly stabbing to death a woman and two young children, according to complaints filed in Franklin County Circuit Court in Ohio. Callahan faces the death penalty in the case, which is still pending. The Columbus Post Dispatch reported shortly after Callahan’s arrest that he had been given early release from federal prison on a 12-½ year sentence for selling crack that was handed down in 2007: The man charged with killing an ex-girlfriend and two of her children in a North Side stabbing rampage early on Tuesday likely would have been deep into a 12 1/2-year federal prison sentence if sentencing guidelines for convicted crack dealers had remained unchanged. Wendell L. Callahan, 35, twice benefited from changes in federal sentencing guidelines, which reduced his sentence by a total of more than four years, from the 150 months he was first given in 2007, to 110 months in 2008 including time served, and 100 months in 2011. Columbus police charged Callahan on Tuesday with three counts of murder in the deaths of ex-girlfriend Erveena Hammonds, 32, and her daughters, Breya Hammonds, 7, and Anaesia Green, 10. A number of media outlets have since reported that Callahan had been “pardoned” by Obama — but that’s not true. Callahan’s federal sentence was shortened by an amendment to federal sentencing guidelines that went into effect on November 1, 2007 — more than a year before Obama took office, according to a report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission: On May 1, 2007, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(a) and (p), the Commission submitted to Congress amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines that became effective on November 1, 2007. One of those amendments, Amendment 706, modified the drug quantity thresholds in the Drug Quantity Table of §2D1.1 so as to assign, for crack cocaine offenses, base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that include the statutory mandatory minimum penalties. Crack cocaine offenses for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quantities similarly were adjusted downward by two levels. The amendment also included a mechanism to determine a combined base offense level in an offense involving crack cocaine and other controlled substances. On December 11, 2007, the Commission voted to promulgate Amendment 713, which added Amendment 706 as amended by 711, to the amendments listed in subsection (c) in §1B1.10 that apply retroactively. The Commission voted to make Amendment 713 effective on March 3, 2008. As a result, some incarcerated offenders are eligible to receive a reduction in their sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) pursuant to Amendment 706. And the second time Callahan’s sentence was reduced — from 110 months to 100 months — was approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama in August 2010. The law reduced the disparity between sentences for crack-cocaine and power cocaine, the Sentencing Commission reports : This report provides data concerning the retroactive application of the guideline amendment implementation of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), Pub. L. No. 111–220, signed into law on August 3, 2010. The FSA increased the quantities of crack cocaine that trigger the five and ten-year statutory mandatory minimum penalties — from five grams to 28 grams for fiveyear mandatory minimums and from 50 to 280 grams for ten-year mandatory minimums — and eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine. Significantly, the FSA gave the Commission emergency amendment authority to temporarily change the guidelines to implement the statutory changes and to add certain enhancements and reductions to the guidelines. So, it’s true that Obama signed Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 into law — but Congress drafted and approved the bill with bipartisan support. It’s misleading to place the blame for any consequences solely on Obama. That’s why we’re call this one “mostly fiction.” ","Obama"

"Obama Years Explained in Nine Charts-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-08-31 11:41:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-years-explained-in-nine-charts/"," A graphic making its way around social media shows the negative impact of President Obama’s policies and the illusion of economic recovery in nine charts. "," Claims made about the impact of President Obama’s eight years in office in these nine charts are all of the above: true, false and misleading. These charts seem to have originated in a blog posted at WND in March 2016 under the headline, “Obama’s Latest Fraud: ‘Economic Recovery’ Disproven in Just Nine Charts.” Donald Trump brought them to the fore by retweeting them during the presidential campaign. The charts claim to show the devastating impact of Obama’s policies on student loan debt, food stamps, federal debt, health insurance costs, labor force participation, business workforce share of income, median household income and homeownership. We’ll take a look at claims made in each of these charts. Student Debt Grew from $146.6 Billion to $945.6 Billion from 2009-2015- Truth! & False! It’s true that student debt totaled about $945.6 billion by the fourth quarter of 2015 — but the claim that student debt totaled $146.6 billion when Obama took office is false. In reality, outstanding student debt totaled nearly $800 billion in 2009 when Obama took office, and by June 2010 it had reached $830 billion. It should be noted that that amount included $665 billion in federal education loans and $168 billion in private student loans, the Federal Reserve reports . So, the end point cited in the chart is roughly correct, but the starting point appears to have been misrepresented to make it appear that Obama should share more of the fault in the country’s student debt quagmire than he actually does. In reality, student debt has exploded over the last 15 years, under both Obama and President George W. Bush. In 2000, when Bush took office, outstanding student debt stood at $200 billion. By the second quarter of 2016, that amount had risen to more than $1.2 trillion, the Federal Reserve reports . Food Stamp Program Grew from $54.8 Billion in 2009 to $69.4 Billion in 2014- Truth! & Misleading! The claim that federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) program (also known as food stamps) grew from $54.8 billion in 2009 to $69.4 billion in 2014 is true — but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that SNAP caseloads “grew significantly” from 2007 to 2011 due to the great recession and lagging economic recovery. By 2014, however, SNAP caseloads began falling and continued to fall through 2015: SNAP caseloads began falling in 2014 and continued falling in 2015. SNAP caseload growth slowed substantially in 2012 and 2013, and caseloads fellby about 2 percent in 2014 and another 2 percent in 2015.  For more than two years, fewer people have participated in SNAP each month than in the same month one year earlier. The number of people receiving SNAP has fallen by 2.6 million people since peaking in December 2012.[4] In 42 states, the number of SNAP participants was lower in December 2015 than in December 2012.[5] As a result of fewer caseloads, SNAP spending also fell. In 2014, at its peak, SNAP spending accounted for about 0.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 2016, SNAP spending had fallen to about 0.425 percent of GDP. So, it’s true that there was an increase in SNAP funding through 2014 — but the chart is misleading because it doesn’t reflect increases in SNAP spending trends before Obama took office, or drops in SNAP spending in 2015 and 2016. Federal Debt will Nearly Double Under President Obama- Truth! This one is true. Federal Debt has more than doubled since Obama took office. By the beginning of 2016, national debt stood at $13.6 trillion — a 116 percent increase since Obama took office, the Treasury Department reports . Health Insurance Costs Have Skyrocketed Under Obama- Misleading! This chart argues that the consumer price index for medical care has increased from 149.952 in January 2009 to 186.961 in February 2016 — however, these numbers refer to the chained consumer price index for urban (C-CPI-U) customers, not overall medical costs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics explains that the C-CPI-U was established in 2002 to “reflect the effect of substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices.” Simply put, it’s not the best way to determine overall health insurance costs. The Insurance Journal reports that the average health care rate increase for mid-size and large companies was 3.2 percent in 2015, marking the lowest rate increase in nearly 20 years. The projected minimum increase for 2016 was 4.1 percent. However, despite low rate increases, the average amount that employees have to contribute toward health care has increased 134 percent over the last 10 years, the journal reports : …Employees contributed $2,490 toward the premium and another $2,208 in out-of-pocket costs, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles in 2015. In contrast, the amount of employees’ premium and out-of-pocket costs combined in 2005 was just $2,001. So, health care costs undoubtedly continue to increase. However, it’s not clear why the chart referenced here uses C-CPI-U to argue that overall healthcare costs are up under Obama. Labor Force Participation Dropped 65.7% in 2009 to 62.9% in 2016- True! This one is straightforward and easy to verify. The labor force participation rate was 65.7 percent in January 2009 and 62.9 percent in February 2016. Business Workforce Share of Income Index Dropped from 103.605 in 2007 to 99.350 in 2015- Misleading! The numbers referenced here are true — workforce share of non-farm business income was 103.605 in the second quarter of 2007 and about 99.350 in the third quarter of 2015. However, the chart fails to provide historical context showing that workforce share of business income has been dropping significantly since 2000. In the first quarter of 2001, the index stood at 107.659. By the first quarter of 2009, it had dropped to 99.328. So, the workforce share of business income is actually up slightly from when Obama took office, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reports . Median Household Income Fell from $57,357 in 2007 to $53,657 in 2014- Fiction! It’s true that the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the median household income from 2010-2014 to be $53,482 — but it’s not true that median household income was $57,357 in 2007. The Census Bureau reports that the median household income decreased 1.2 percent from 2007 to 2008, from $52,673 to $52,029. That means median household income is up slightly under Obama. Homeownership Rate Drops from 67.4% in 2009 to 63.7% in 2015- Truth! This claim is true, and the homeownership rate actually fell more in 2016, landing at 62.9 percent, the Census Bureau reported in July 2016 . The Wall Street Journal reported that a large part of that was lingering effects of the housing market crash of 2008, as well as student debt restricting younger homebuyers: There are many ways to interpret the numbers. Part of the story is the catastrophic housing market collapse, which was especially severe for Generation X—those born from 1965 to 1984. Younger households may struggle to save amid student debt, growing rents, rising home prices and limited inventories of starter homes. Indeed, the homeownership rate for 18- to 35-year-olds slipped to 34.1%, the lowest level in records dating to 1994. At 77.9%, the homeownership rate was highest for those 65 years and over. But the broader picture suggests a degree of economic strength: Renters are spurring a steady increase in overall household formation. Renter-occupied housing units jumped by 967,000 from the same period a year earlier. Overall, household formation has been fairly steady since the early days of the expansion. The bottom line is that these homeownership stats are true. ","Obama"
"Rush Limbaugh: Obama Invading Red States with Lesbian Farmers-Truth!","2016-08-24 15:14:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rush-limbaugh-obama-invading-red-states-lesbian-farmers/"," Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of sending lesbian farmers into red states and rural Republican strongholds. "," It’s true that Rush Limbaugh accused President Obama of “attacking” rural states with lesbian farmers. Limbaugh made the allegations in an August 17th segment on his radio show in which he took issue with the Iowa LGBT Rural Summit event that was hosted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA describes its LGBT Summit Series and the corresponding #RuralPride campaign on its website as such: The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights, in collaboration with the National Center for Lesbian Rights and The True Colors Fund, will engage with LGBT rural communities across the country to host the LGBT Rural Summit Series. Each series will offer a unique opportunity for USDA and other federal agencies to share information relating to policies, programs, and services that exist to protect, promote and strengthen LGBT rural communities. Issues ranging from rural housing loans, community facility grants and bullying will be discussed. Each series will also include a strong presence from local nonprofit organizations, sharing USDA’s dedication to serving LGBT rural America. The Iowa LGBT Rural Summit event in question was held on August 18th in Des Moines. In his August 17th segment, Limbaugh said the Obama administration was using federal funds to breakup rural Republican strongholds: Rural America happens to be largely conservative. Rural America is made up of self-reliant, rugged individualist types. They happen to be big believers in the Second Amendment. So here comes the Obama Regime with a bunch of federal money and they’re waving it around, and all you gotta do to get it is be a lesbian and want to be a farmer and they’ll set you up. I’m like you; I never before in my life knew that lesbians wanted to be farmers. I never knew that lesbians wanted to get behind the horse and the plow and start burrowing. I never knew it. But apparently enough money it make it happen, and the objective here is to attack rural states. They’re already attacking suburbs, and that has been made perfectly clear by what happened in Milwaukee. They’re going after every geographic region that is known to be largely conservative. They never stop, folks. They are constantly on the march. So, it’s true that Rush Limbaugh said that Obama was sending lesbian farmers to invade liberal communities. ","Obama"
"President Obama’s Plan to Diversify the Suburbs-Mostly Truth!","2016-08-23 13:51:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obamas-plan-diversify-suburbs/"," President Obama plans to diversify the suburbs through a combination of federal regulations and new funding formulas for housing vouchers. "," The Obama administration’s plan to “further fair housing” has been inching forward for some time, and it would likely result in more diverse suburbs. There are two main parts to claims about Obama’s plans diversify the suburbs. The first part, which was set into motion in 2015, established new requirements for cities that receive federal housing grants to document and report on racially biased housing practices on a regular basis (we’ll cover that later). The second part was set into motion in June 2016. We’ll start there. In June 2016, HUD proposed a rule that would change the formula for how Fair Market Rents (FMR) are calculated. The FMR determines how much Section 8 housing assistance renters in a particular area can receive. The goal, HUD explains, is to promote more housing choices: In metropolitan areas where there is a wide variance in the rents being charged to tenants and where voucher holders are concentrated in a few high-poverty neighborhoods, HUD is proposing to calculate FMRs based upon the rents being charged by the zip codes within that area. This permits FMRs and the resulting payment standards to be higher in low-poverty/high-rent areas, and lower in high-poverty/low-rent areas. The idea, known as the Small Area Fair Market Rent approach, HUD explains, is to “increase voucher holders’ access to a greater number of units in low poverty areas while reducing excess subsidy from some high poverty neighborhoods.” Right or wrong, some have interpreted that as Obama trying to diversify the suburbs. HUD is accepting public comment on the rule, and some expected that it would be finalized in fall of 2016. And, when it comes the first HUD rule from 2015, its origins actually date back to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on housing and community grants published in 2010. The report, titled “ HUD Needs to Enhance Its Requirements and Oversight of Jurisdiction’s Fair Housing Plans ,” looked at how cities that receive federal grant funding are furthering fair housing opportunities, a requirement of the Civil Rights Act of 1968: Pursuant to the Fair Housing Act, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations require grantees, such as cities, that receive federal funds through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) to further fair housing opportunities. In particular, grantees are required to prepare planning documents known as Analyses of Impediments (AI), which are to identify impediments to fair housing (such as restrictive zoning or segregated housing) and actions to overcome them. HUD has oversight responsibility for AIs. This report (1) assesses both the conformance of CDBG and HOME grantees AIs’ with HUD guidance pertaining to their timeliness and content and their potential usefulness as planning tools and (2) identifies factors in HUD’s requirements and oversight that may help explain any AI weaknesses. The GAO reviewed the AIs of 441 cities across the country. The watchdog found that 29 percent of cities that had received CDBG and HOME grants had Analysis of Impediments (AI) documents in place that predated 2004, 11 percent of the AI documents hadn’t been updated since the 1990s although they’re supposed to be updated every five years. About half of the cities with AIs that were drafted after 2005 didn’t meet minimum requirements, and 25 cities didn’t submit any AI documents at all. Following the study, the GAO recommended that HUD step up regulations to ensure that cities that receive federal CDBG and HOME grants comply with statutory requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1968: GAO recommends that, through regulation, HUD require grantees to update their AIs periodically, follow a specific format, and submit them for review. HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but noted recent efforts to improve compliance and oversight. HUD published a final rule on “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” (AFFH) in the Federal Register on July 16, 2015. The rule established new reporting requirements for cities that receive HUD grants to look for and report on racial population disparities every five years to help identify trends and promote long-term integration. HUD explained the new regulation with this statement : HUD’s rule clarifies and simplifies existing fair housing obligations for HUD grantees to analyze their fair housing landscape and set locally-determined fair housing priorities and goals through an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH). To aid communities in this work, HUD will provide open data to grantees and the public on patterns of integration and segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disproportionate housing needs, and disparities in access to opportunity. This improved approach provides a better mechanism for HUD grantees to build fair housing goals into their existing community development and housing planning processes. In addition to providing data and maps, HUD will also provide technical assistance to aid grantees as they adopt this approach. HUD’s rule took steps to ensure that communities comply with a nearly 40-year-old requirement that communities receiving HUD funding continuously take steps to remove barriers to fair housing practices. Taken together, HUD’s actions could result in the diversification of the suburbs — even if it’s not the stated purpose. That’s why we’re calling this one mostly truth. ","Obama"

"UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police-Fiction!","2016-08-05 14:09:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/un-backs-secret-obama-takeover-police/"," The United Nations has backed President Obama’s secret plan to nationalize local police departments. "," The UN hasn’t backed Obama’s secret plan to takeover local police departments — and we couldn’t find evidence to prove that a “secret plan” like that exists. These rumors stem from a statement released by Maina Kiai , a human rights attorney from Kenya who was appointed by the UN Human Rights Commission to research and report on “the rights of freed of peaceful assembly and of association” in the United States in July 2016. One paragraph of Kiai’s lengthy statement drew speculation about the UN backing Obama’s police takeover: “The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice has provided oversight and recommendations for improvement of police services in a number of cities with consent decrees. This is one of the most effective ways to reduce discrimination in law enforcement and it needs to be beefed up and increased to cover as many of the 18,000-plus local law enforcement jurisdictions.” A website called Lifezette started rumors that Kiai’s statement meant the UN had backed a nationalized police force in the United States. In an article published August 4th under the headline, “UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police,” the website reports: (That quote was from) United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local police and corrections departments. The story’s first mistake is that it mischaracterizes exactly what a “special rapporteur” is and falsely implied in the headline that Kiai’s statement amounted to a UN endorsement. In reality, a special rapporteur is an independent expert that the UN Human Rights Council has appointed to examine and report back on events unfolding in a country, or on a particular human rights theme. Then, the UN Human Rights Commission reviews and critiques that report and decides whether or not to act on it, according to special procedures of the Human Rights Council: The Commission on Human Rights exercises oversight over the work of the experts while keeping in mind that the experts are irremovable, independent and are immune from legal process . It examines their reports and passes resolutions either welcoming or criticizing the work of the expert, or simply takes note of their action …. Simply put, a special rapporteur does not speak for the UN; Kiai’s statement doesn’t amount to the UN “backing” anything. rapporteurLifezette explains Obama’s “secret plans” to take control of local police departments by issuing a flurry of the “consent decrees” (which Kiai endorsed in his statement): The consent decrees are already being implemented in Newark, New Jersey; Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; and other municipalities… In short, the much-feared nationalization of local police departments is already being initiated by the Obama administration’s Justice Department. And somehow nobody noticed. But those claims about where consent decrees have been issued are misleading, and in some instances they’re false. The Los Angeles consent decree was issued under Bill Clinton in the 1990s — not Obama. The Miami consent decree was issued due to violations of the Clean Water Act — it had nothing do with police. Chicago, meanwhile, asked for a DOJ investigation of police tactics in December 2015 , and the review is ongoing (no consent decree has been issued). The story did, however, correctly report the Ferguson and Newark consent decrees reached under Obama. But a Washington Post review of the number of DOJ investigations launched and the number of consent decrees reached over the last two decades don’t support the idea that Obama is secretly trying to use them to create a nationalized police force: In the past two decades, the Justice Department has launched 67 civil rights investigations of police departments. Nine remain unresolved. Of the completed investigations, 24 were closed without reform agreements, meaning investigators did not have sufficient evidence to prove civil rights abuses or the agencies informally resolved the problems, officials said. In eight investigations, Justice documented patterns of civil rights abuses­ and won promises from the departments to reform. Those cases were settled out of court with no independent or federal oversight. Twenty-six investigations — a little more than half of them since President Obama took office — have led to the most rigorous outcome: binding agreements tracked by monitors. More than half were consent decrees, meaning they were approved and managed in federal court. In the end, there doesn’t seem to be sufficient evidence to prove that Obama is using consent decrees to secretly takeover the country’s police forces. And the UN hasn’t endorsed that — even though a special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Commission did. ","Obama"
"Malik Obama Plans to Vote for Donald Trump-Truth!","2016-07-25 09:46:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/malik-obama-plans-vote-donald-trump/"," President Obama’s half-brother, Malik Obama, plans to vote for Donald Trump. "," Reports that Malik Obama plans to vote for Donald Trump in November are true. Rumors that President Obama’s half-brother said he would vote for Trump started with a New York Post report that was published under the headline, “Why Obama’s Half-Brother Says He’ll Be Voting for Donald Trump” that was published on July 24th. The story reports that Malik Obama plans to vote for Trump because “he speaks from the heart” and because he as “deep disappointment” in President Obama’s time in office: Obama, 58, a longtime Democrat, said his “deep disappointment” in his brother Barack’s administration has led him to recently switch allegiance to “the party of Lincoln.” Barack Obama is seen with his half-brother, Malik.Photo: AP The last straw, he said, came earlier this month when FBI Director James Comey recommended not prosecuting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her use of a private e-mail servers while secretary of state. “She should have known better as the custodian of classified information,” said Obama. He’s also annoyed that Clinton and President Obama killed Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, whom he called one of his best friends. Malik Obama dedicated his 2012 biography of his late father to Khadafy and others who were “making this world a better place.” “I still feel that getting rid of Khadafy didn’t make things any better in Libya,” he said. “My brother and the secretary of state disappointed me in that regard.” But Malik Obama said that what bothers him the most about the Democratic Party is it’s support of same-sex marriage: “I feel like a Republican now because they don’t stand for same-sex marriage, and that appeals to me,” he said. Obama believes strongly in the institution of marriage — so strongly that he has at least three current wives, although press reports have put the number as high as 12. When asked by The Post how many wives and children he has, Obama demurred. “That’s personal,” he said. Follow-up reports confirmed Malik Obama’s plans to vote for Donald Trump in No November. Malike Obama confirmed in an interview with Reuters that he agreed with Trump’s stance on Muslims — even though Malik is a Muslim himself: Malik, a U.S. citizen, has lived in Washington since 1985 where he worked with various firms before becoming an independent financial consultant. Trump’s stance against Muslims coming in to the United States was understandable even to Muslims like himself, Malik said. “I’m a Muslim, of course, but you can’t have people going around just shooting people and killing people just in the name of Islam,” he said. He criticized President Obama’s record in the White House saying he had not done much for the American people and his extended family despite the high expectations that accompanied his election in 2008, both in the United States and Kenya. So, given that multiple sources have reported that Malik Obama plans to vote for Donald Trump in November, we’re calling this one “truth.” ","Obama"
"President Obama Adds Islamic Symbols to White House Fence-Fiction!","2016-07-22 11:55:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-adds-islamic-symbols-white-house-fence/"," It’s been rumored that changes to the White House fence have brought new, subtle symbols that resemble the domes of a Muslim mosque were made at President Obama’s request "," President Obama didn’t add Islamic symbols to the White House fence. Those rumors started on right-wing blog sites in response to reports that changes to the White House fence had been approved. One site, US Herald, reported that Obama had orderd that Muslim symbols be added in a story that appeared under the headline, “Obama Does THIS to the White House Fence When No One Was Looking — Americans Want it Down ASAP.” The story includes these side-by-side images of the fence’s artwork and a mosque: There’s one big problem with that claim, however. Those so-called Muslim symbols have been included in the wrought iron design of the White House face for more than a century. This photo, archived by the Library of Congress , shows protestors for the women’s suffrage movement picketing in front of those “Islamic” wrought iron design elements in August 1917: In reality, changes to the White House fence were proposed by the National Park Service in 2016 to increase security after a number of intruders scaled it. That proposal, which was approved by the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts in June, would extend the height of the fence to about 11 feet, Fox News reports : WASHINGTON –  A plan to increase the overall height of the fence surrounding the White House by approximately 6 feet, about doubling its current height, won preliminary approval from a Washington arts commission Thursday. The move follows high-profile security breaches at the executive mansion over the past two years. The U.S. Commission of Fine Arts gave its concept approval Thursday to the new design, which also includes thicker and stronger metal fence pickets. The new design still must be reviewed by a second commission, the National Capital Planning Commission. The final design also must win approval from both commissions. Secret Service and National Park Service officials said in a statement that they hope to begin constructing the new fence by 2018. Although the taller fence won’t be installed until 2018, more subtle security enhancements were made in June 2015. Small metal spikes were added to the top of the fence. A photo of a worker installing the spikes with a drill has often been used to support claims that Islamic symbols had just been added. But the worker was actually added the spikes that can be seen here: So, claims that President Obama secretly ordered Islamic symbols to be included in the White House fence are false. ","Obama"
"Doe Run Lead Plant Closing Is Backdoor Gun Control-Fiction!","2016-07-21 10:50:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/doe-run-lead-plant-closing-backdoor-gun-control/"," The Obama White House has taken a “backdoor” approach to gun control by having the EPA close the Doe Run Lead plant in Missouri, which means that all lead bullets will have to be imported from overseas. "," Rumors that President Obama forced the Doe Run Company to cease lead smelting operations through EPA regulations in a “back door” gun control effort are false. The rumors began circulating in 2013, shortly after the Doe Run Company announced that it was closing its primary lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri. The company announced that it had decided to close the smelter in response to EPA regulations: In 2010, Doe Run reached a comprehensive settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Missouri. As part of that settlement, the Company agreed to discontinue its smelting operations in Herculaneum by the end of 2013. Over the operating life of the smelter, the Company spent millions of dollars in environmental and other upgrades. Continuing to upgrade the aging smelter to attempt to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations imposed on primary lead smelters was not economically feasible given the many other requirements of our business. The company said in the same statement that 80 percent of lead produced by the Herculaneum smelter was used in batteries, but that additional applications included ammunition and construction materials. That sparked accusations that President Obama had intentionally forced the company to stop smelting lead so that no lead bullets would be produced in the U.S. However, that claims is wrong on two key fronts: the EPA standard was established while President George W. Bush was in office, and lead smelted in the U.S. can still be used for ammunition. The EPA changed the ambient air quality standard for lead from 1.5 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air to 0.15 micrograms in October 2008 — a full two months before President Obama was sworn into office in January 2009. That means the change was not a backdoor attempt by Obama to implement gun control measures, as has been claimed. Also, even though the Doe Run Company no longer smelts lead from ore to produce bullets, the company has said that it could continue producing bullets using secondary lead: Lead is used in numerous other products, including ammunition and construction materials, as well as to protect against radiation in medical and military applications. While most applications can use secondary lead, those applications that require primary lead will need to import the lead metal in the future. Any additional demand for lead (above that which can be met through recycling at secondary smelters) will also have to be met through imports. Given all that, we’re calling claims that the Doe Run Company closing its primary lead smelter was a backdoor attempt at gun regulation “fiction.” ","Obama"

"," There’s nothing to support the claim that President Obama is a secret member of the New Black Panthers Party. People who support the idea that Obama is a closeted Black Panther have been circulating a photo taken in 1998 that appears to show Obama dressed as a Black Panther and holding a gun. But that photo was doctored — Obama’s head was added onto another man’s body. The photo actually shows Maruse Heath, a leader of the New Black Panther Party, and an unnamed man kneeling to his right with a gun. The photo was likely taken from a Daily Mail article about Heath being arrested on a weapons violation: Obama’s head was added to the unnamed man’s body, and Maruse Heath was cropped out, so this photo obviously doesn’t support the claim that Obama is secretly a Black Panther: Another bit of evidence that has been used to support that claim is that Obama supposedly marched with leaders of the Black Panthers in 2007 and “shared a podium with them.” Those rumors started in 2007 at Breitbart with a story that appeared under the headline , “Shock Photos: Candidate Obama Appeared and Marched with New Black Panthers Party in 2007.” The story includes this screen grab of Obama marching with members of the Black Panthers behind him: The story states that members of the Black Panthers “explicitly came to Selma to support Obama,” which isn’t necessarily true. Obama and the Black Panthers joined thousands in commemorating the 42nd anniversary of the civil rights march in Selma, the Birmingham News reports: Former President Bill Clinton and presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama locked arms with civil rights icons Sunday and marched through thousands of wellwishers, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge to cap the 42nd anniversary Right to Vote and Bridge Crossing Jubilee. And the YouTube video that the screen grab was taken from seems to disprove the idea that Obama and the Black Panthers were marching together. Rather, they can be seen marching in a sea of protestors, and it would seem unlikely that Obama would have known who was in his general vicinity, including the Black Panthers. Finally, another argument that Obama posted an endorsement from the Black Panthers on his campaign website during the presidential election was shot down by the Washington Times in 2008. The site reports that the campaign allowed anyone to post endorsement pages, that one posted by Black Panthers member was taken down when discovered by the campaign: Sen. Barack Obama, struggling to distance himself from racially incendiary sermons by his longtime pastor, yesterday faced renewed scrutiny because of an endorsement from an anti-government, black-separatist group on his campaign’s official blog site. The New Black Panther Party, a “black power” group that calls on blacks to arm themselves and frequently espouses anti-white and anti-Semitic rhetoric, posted an endorsement on the Web site that said: “Obama will stir the ‘Melting Pot’ into a better ‘Molten America.’ “ The campaign yesterday took down the Black Panthers’ page on the Web site. “We removed the user-generated blog post because we don’t condone any group that advocates violence,” Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor told reporter S.A. Miller of The Washington Times. “Senator Obama gave a 37-minute speech about race [Tuesday], and we hope people will focus on that and not what one individual posted on a blog.” So, given that various bits of “evidence” to support the idea that Obama is a member of the Black Panthers don’t check out, we’re calling this claim fiction.

"," The American flag was removed from the White House logo well before President Obama took office. The change occurred in 2003, during President George W. Bush’s first term in office. An archived version of the White House website on Bush’s last day in office (January 20, 2009) features the “new” version of the White House logo with the white flag in the upper left-hand corner: President Reagan was the first president to widely use the logo, and back then if featured a full color red, white and blue flag flying above the White House: It’s not clear why the George W. Bush administration changed the full colored flag to white, but it’s possible that it was because it made printing and scaling the logo easier. But there is a kernel of truth to rumors about changes to the flag under the Obama administration. Changes were made to the White House logo, but they were subtle and would be hardly noticeable to the untrained eye. The ad agency Hello Monday blogged at Medium that it was invited to participate in a redesign of the White House logo in 2009. After studying the logo used under the Bush administration, Hello Monday quickly noted a number of mistakes. Specifically, an alternating pattern of pyramids and arches above the windows appeared wrong in the logo, and the alignment of the back columns in the logo didn’t match the real White House. The agency suggested changes, but was denied: We decided to clean it up and create 2 versions: a more streamlined version that kept the important details minus the triangle over the window, and a simplified version for digital use. We also optimized the kerning and tracking of the logotype. We then presented our findings and recommendations to the White House. A week later they told us that they would not be moving forward with the project. Obviously we were very bummed. And also a bit surprised to see that they kept the erroneous logo up the next 7 years. By 2016, however, the Obama administration was ready to make some changes to the White House logo. Hello Monday noted that the new logo fixed the pyramids (like they had suggested in 2009), cleaned up the lines and added a simplified “baby” logo for digital use: INSERT Again, the changes were so subtle that they might only be noticeable to an ad agency that previously studied the logo. But that didn’t stop conspiracy theories that Obama changed the logo to remove the stars and stripes as one of his first acts as president, or that he had done so later on to signal surrender to American foes. Both theories are false. The stars and stripes were removed from the White House logo under President George W. Bush, and a 2016 redesign under Obama was a subtle “clean up” job. ","Obama"

"," A fake news website is behind false reports that President Obama has taken executive action to ban the sale of assault rifles That story appeared at a fake news website that is mocked up to look like ABC News under the headline, “President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the Sale of Assault Weapons.” The story begins: WASHINGTON D.C. (AP) — After Sunday’s mass shooting in Orlando, which left 50 Americans dead and 53 wounded, President Obama decided to take unilateral action on gun control by signing Executive Order 13691. The new law bans all sales of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales, regardless of whether the transaction takes place at a gun dealership or gun show. The requirement also extends to private sales and requires all private firearm sellers to broker the sale through a federally licensed gun dealer. The order requires prospective gun buyers to undergo a psychological evaluation. Individuals who have been committed involuntarily to a mental health institution at any time; those who have been voluntarily committed with the past 5 years; anyone with a domestic violence restraining order, regardless of criminal history; and anyone who has been placed on the no-fly list or terrorist watch listat any time within the past 10 years will not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms. The story was widely circulated on social media, and the fake news website’s resemblance to ABC News tricked many into believing that report was true, but that’s not the case. The website uses a classic trick to scam readers into believing its an official ABC News website: a subtle “.co” is added to the end of ABC New’s official website URL, which is very easy to miss at first glance. If that wasn’t enough, the fake news story cites Executive Order 13691 as the one that the president signed to ban the sale of assault rifles — but a quick read of that executive order reveals that it’s not about assault rifles or any other guns. It’s about cybersecurity information sharing. President Obama did, however, sign an executive order related to gun violence into law in January — but it didn’t ban the sale of assault rifles or any other guns. Rather, the executive action stated that the ATF was finalizing a rule requiring a background check for all gun purchases, ordering federal prosecutors to focus on “smart enforcement” of gun laws, increasing mental health treatment and adding it to the background check system, and sponsoring gun safety technology. In the executive order, the president stated that he was committed to using “every tool at the Administration’s disposal” to reduce gun violence, but he noted that many problems could only be fixed through legislation: The President and Vice President are committed to using every tool at the Administration’s disposal to reduce gun violence. Some of the gaps in our country’s gun laws can only be fixed through legislation, which is why the President continues to call on Congress to pass the kind of commonsense gun safety reforms supported by a majority of the American people. And while Congress has repeatedly failed to take action and pass laws that would expand background checks and reduce gun violence, today, building on the significant steps that have already been taken over the past several years, the Administration is announcing a series of commonsense executive actions designed to: And Obama talked about making it harder for people who “want to kill Americans” to get their hands on assault riffles in his weekly radio address right before this fake news report went viral, but he didn’t announce any plans to ban the sale of assault rifles through executive order: Alongside the stories of bravery and healing and coming together over the past week, we’ve also seen a renewed focus on reducing gun violence.  As I said a few days ago, being tough on terrorism requires more than talk. Being tough on terrorism, particularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we’ve seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible .  That’s something I’ll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.

"," An Air Force Thunderbird crashed after doing a flyover at the 2016 Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in which President Obama delivered the commencement speech . But there’s no indication that the Thunderbird crashed because it ran out of gas, or because its pilot was waiting for Obama to deliver a speech. The crash occurred shortly after the Thunderbird did multiple flyovers as the June 2nd graduation ceremony came to an end. While the Air Force has not released information about what caused the Thunderbird to crash, there are a number of major problems that the Thunderbird crashed because it ran out of gas while waiting for Obama to deliver a speech. First, the Thunderbird that crashed was flying in formation with five other Thunderbirds that day. It doesn’t make sense that one of the Thunderbirds would have run out of gas given that the planes are identical and take off and fly in formation while performing aerial stunts. Second, the theory that the Thunderbird ran out of gas does not match witness reports. An Air Force staff sergeant reported hearing “a few loud bangs” before the plane went down, the military publication Stars and Stripes reports : Air Force Staff Sgt. Alexander Rodriguez, a U.S. Air Force firefighter stationed in San Angelo, Texas, who was visiting with his family, said he raced from his brother’s house after hearing “a few loud bangs” and saw the plane gliding close to the ground before impact. “I started booking straight for the aircraft,” Rodriguez said. “I saw the cockpit was empty and checked for any fuel hazard — there was a single fuel leak on the right side. I heard a ticking noise that indicated something was still running and I backed off.” That witness report doesn’t seem to indicate that the plane ran out of fuel. And given that the Air Force Thunderbird perform more than 40 shows a year that require them to fly in tight formations while doing aerial stunts, crashes have been known to happen. The Associated Press reported on a similar crash in 2005: The Thunderbirds are the Air Force’s precision flying team, known for their red, white and blue painted F-16 fighter jets. The unit, based out of Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Base, will perform more than 40 shows in 2016, according to its website. The vaunted aerial demonstration team has been performing air demonstrations since 1947. During a performance at the Chicago Air and Water Show in 2005, two of the jets made contact while they were flying in formation, and a missile rail was dislodged. No one was injured in that accident. The group was in a diamond formation when a 4-foot-long missile rail came loose from the wing of one of their jets. The carbon fiber object fell into Lake Michigan, roughly 2,500 feet from where spectators had gathered to watch the show. No one was hurt. There’s no indication that the Thunderbird ran out of gas, or that the pilot was waiting for Obama to deliver his commencement address. That’s why we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","Obama"

Obama issued a presidential proclamation on May 31, 2016, that declared June 2016 LGBT Pride month and called on “the people of the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate the great diversity of the American people.” The presidential proclamation state, in part: Since our founding, America has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect Union.  This journey, led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow, has never been easy or smooth.  The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society.  They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment — under our laws, from our courts, and in our politics.  This month, we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point, and we recommit to bending the arc of our Nation toward justice. Last year’s landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines.  For every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every American who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope, affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals.

Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz fanned the flames in 2014 by retweeting the Texas A&M study with the hashtag #AggieJoke — but many of Cruz’s followers simply read the headline and missed the joke: That led a Texas A&M official to go on the record with The Eagle , the university’s student newspaper , to clarify that the so-called study was a hoax: The study is clearly a joke. The click-bait headline combines Texas A&M + Obama + “best president,” but when you read through the “methodology” Obama is actually the worst president. The A&M spokesman said the chain-joke-spam-letter first cropped up in the early fall and that he wasn’t sure why it had just resurfaced. He said the university had not formally distanced themselves from the study because officials didn’t want to help it spread. Not that there was ever any doubt, but Texas A&M University has nothing to do with the chain study about President Barack Obama that’s spreading around. An A&M spokesman said it’s a hoax.

"," There’s no record of President Obama encouraging schools to teach the Quran for extra credit. That rumor has been circulating in opinion sections and editorials for years, but there’s never been any evidence or source material provided to support the claim. The earliest version of the claim that Obama had encouraged schools to teach the Quran for extra credit appeared in an op-ed published by the Washington Times in February 2015. The opinion piece, which appeared under the headline, “Return to Judeo-Christianity Needed Now” includes this often-repeated paragraph : Now President Obama is encouraging schools to teach the Quran for extra credit, while at the same time, they cannot even talk about the Bible, God, pray, or salute the American Flag. The op-ed doesn’t provide a source or link to anything that backs up the claim that Obama is encouraging schools to teach the Quran for extra credit. The article does cite the story of a Marine father who was thrown out of a school in La Plata, Maryland, for protesting a homework assignment that his daughter was given about the history of Islam ( click here for our report on that one ). And w e previously investigated another similar report , that Obama had ordered a Nationwide Muslim Outreach Program, and found that one to be false as well. However, while those stories are often referenced in claims about studying the Quran for extra credit, that tidbit doesn’t appear in either of them. Given that nothing has been provided to back up the claim that Obama is encouraging the schools to study the Quran for extra credit, we’re calling this one fiction. ","Obama"

"," President Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima since an atomic bomb was dropped there in August 1945 — but reports that he apologized are false. Obama visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on May 27th and laid a wreath in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in remembrance of those killed by the atomic bombs that ended World War II. That sparked accusations that the president was on an “apology tour” — which has been a running theme among his critics throughout Obama’s presidency. However, according to transcripts of public remarks that Obama delivered in Hiroshima , he never offered an apology. Rather, he used the visit to warn against the danger of nuclear proliferation. Obama opened his speech with this explanation of his visit: Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself. Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not-so-distant past. We come to mourn the dead, including over 100,000 Japanese men, women and children, thousands of Koreans, a dozen Americans held prisoner. Their souls speak to us. They ask us to look inward, to take stock of who we are and what we might become. Later in his speech, Obama indicated that his visit to Hiroshima was part of a larger call for the world’s powers to draw down nuclear stockpiles and to end nuclear proliferation: That is why we come to this place. We stand here in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell. We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. We listen to a silent cry. We remember all the innocents killed across the arc of that terrible war and the wars that came before and the wars that would follow. Mere words cannot give voice to such suffering. But we have a shared responsibility to look directly into the eye of history and ask what we must do differently to curb such suffering again. Some day, the voices of the hibakusha will no longer be with us to bear witness. But the memory of the morning of Aug. 6, 1945, must never fade. That memory allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. So, claims that President Obama apologized for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima are false. ","Obama"

"," Mashur Ahmed al Sabri has not been released, and its not clear whether or not he played a role in the bombing of the USS Cole. Rumors about Mashur Ahmed al Sabri’s release went viral after he was transferred to a rehabilitation program in Saudi Arabia from Guantanamo Bay in April 2016. News of Mashur Ahmed al Sabri’s transfer without a trial upset Kirk Lippold, the commanding officer of the USS Cole when the guided missile destroyer was attacked in October 2000, who told Fox News : “I would have liked to have seen him receive a military commission where he was tried, convicted and sentenced and then his suitability for release determined under the laws of armed conflict,” Lippold said. “From the perspective of the American people and my crew, he’s never been held accountable,” Lippold added. Major General Jay Hood, the former director of operations at Guantanamo, told Fox News that the Saudi rehabilitation program is well intended and should be applauded, but he also expressed skepticism: “If history is a guide, we can expect to see some number of them back in the fight soon,” he said. “As a group, the Yemenis held at GTMO represented the most committed and violent of the Islamic extremist in US custody.” That report was spun into a story published by the rightwing new site Frontpage Mag under the headline, “Obama Frees USS Cole Bombing Terrorists,” that falsely reported that Mashur Ahmed al Sabri had been definitively linked to the USS Cole bombing and that he had been released by Obama: Walid bin Attash, a planner of the USS Cole bombing and who also played a role in the 9/11 attack, is still at Gitmo. His trial continues to drag on while he and his lawyers play games. Rahim Hussein al-Nashiri, another of the planners, is still awaiting trial. But Mashur Abdallah Ahmed al Sabri, one of the members of the USS Cole cell, has already been released by Barack Obama from Guantanamo Bay. Sabri was rated as a high risk terrorist who is ”is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests, and allies”, but that was no obstacle for Obama who had already fired one Secretary of Defense for being slow to free dangerous Al Qaeda terrorists and was browbeating his latest appointee over the same issue. Official files on Mashur Ahmed al Sabri indicate that he has indeed been determined to be a “high risk” for returning to terrorist networks if released without trial. However, those files don’t directly link him to the USS Cole bombing. In fact, the documents indicate that Mashur Ahmed al Sabri was in Pakistan at the time the USS Cole was bombed while refueling in Yemen in October 2000: Mashur Ahmed al Sabri was indirectly linked to the USS Cole bombing because he once trained with the terrorist cell that carried out the attack, but he has denied involvement, and prosecutors haven’t been able to provide any definitive proof of his involvement, according to documents: So, it’s true that Mashur Ahmed al Sabri has been deemed a “high risk” for rejoining terrorism networks, and that he once trained with a terrorist cell that carried out the USS Cole attack. However, the claim that al Sabri was a “USS Cole bombing terrorist” is unproven, and the report that Obama released him is false. ","Obama"

Instead, it includes a serious of photos of what viewers can only assume is flags being taken down at Obama’s request — but that’s not the case. This above photo, for example, was taken in December 2015 and it shows two sailors aboard the USS Essex amphibious assault ship somberly commemorating the 74th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attacks as they passed the USS Arizona Memorial.

Additional photos that show men pointing at a flag at the Marine Remembrance Memorial first appeared at the website Americans Working Together in 2007, before President Obama was sworn into office. At the time, the flagpoles were reportedly voluntarily removed due to the National Park Service’s record of maintenance (it’s not clear exactly what that means, or if the flagpoles were ever put up again): And prior to the voluntary removal of the flags in 2007, there was even more flap over the Marine Remembrance Memorial’s flags. Jonathan Jarvis, who oversaw redevelopment at Pearl Harbor as the director of the Pacific West Region of the National Park Service before he was appointed director of the National Park Service, reportedly ordered the removal of the Marine Remembrance to make way for redevelopment but was rebuffed by a grassroots veterans effort .

Sylvia Thompson, who identifies herself as a “black conservative writer,” wrote a column that was published by Renew America in October 2015 under the headline, “Barack Obama Is Not Seeking ‘Legacy.’” In the column, Sylvia Thompson argues in the column that Obama is not legacy building because “the term legacy has positive connotations of something bequeath that is to the receiver’s benefit” and “everything that Barack Obama does is calculated to destroy America, which he despises.” Sylvia Thompson takes issue with a number of Obama’s policies, including the nuclear deal with Iran and what she calls “imposition of a polluting homosexual, anti-Christian agenda upon military ranks.” She continues: Many, many Americans are thoroughly fed up with Barack Obama and the spineless crop of political leaders who ignore his criminality. It is yet unknown whether Republicans will ever garner the backbone to become a true opposition party and hold him accountable. Promising signs are the House conservatives’ getting rid of establishment types John Boehner and Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker and Speaker hopeful, respectively, and Donald Trump’s entry into the 2016 presidential race with enough money and testicular fortitude to tell the Establishment and the Left where to shove it. Should these positive trends not continue and the 2016 election cycle yield no movement to counter all the harm that Barack Obama has done to this nation, I think there will be massive disruption. Those folks in the National Rifle Association ads currently running on television seem very serious to me, and that is a good thing. Renew America is a right-wing website that was founded in 2002 to provide “grassroots support for Allan Keyes’ MSNBC TV show ‘Alan Keyes Making Sense.’ However, the website has evolved into a “significant Christian political vehicle — gathering scores of talented new writers (along with a handful of well-known established ones); promoting the core issues of moral conservatism in a highly-readable ‘magazine’ format,” according to its “About” page . Sylvia Thompson is a regular contributor to the website and has been highly critical of Obama. Her biography states: Sylvia Thompson is a black conservative writer whose aim is to counter the liberal spin on issues pertaining to race and culture. Ms. Thompson is a copy editor by trade currently residing in Tennessee. She formerly wrote for the Conservative Forum of Silicon Valley California Newsletter and the online conservative blog ChronWatch, also out of California. She grew up in Southeast Texas during the waning years of Jim Crow-era legalized segregation, and she concludes that race relations in America will never improve, nor will we ever elevate our culture, as long as there are victims to be pandered to and villains to be vilified.

"President Obama Gave Himself a Raise Forever-Fiction!","2016-03-28 09:46:00","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-gave-raise-forever/"," After President Obama released his last budget proposal, critics argued that he had given himself a pay raise because he asked for an 18% increase in expenditures for former presidents. "," President Obama hasn’t proposed giving himself, or any other former president, a pay raise. First, we’ll take a quick look at how pensions and benefits for former presidents, and then we’ll take a look at specific claims that President Obama gave himself a “massive raise” in his final budget request. The Former Presidents Act (FPA) of 1958 was established to “maintain the dignity” of the presidency by providing a salary to former presidents, and their widows. Former presidents are given an annual pension equal to pay of cabinet secretaries ($205,000 in 2015), as well as Secret Service protection for life and “transition” assistance to ease the cost of post-presidency life. Additionally, the FPA gives former presidents a budget for “office staff and a suitable office space, appropriately furnished and equipped.” President Obama requested $3.865 million in his fiscal year 2017 budget request for the General Services Administration (GSA) to support pensions and benefits for former presidents. That was an increase of $588,000 (about 18%) from the previous fiscal year’s budget, which led to claims that Obama had “given himself a massive raise.” In truth, Obama requested an 18% increase in fiscal year 2017 because there will be another former president to support that year: himself. The president’s budget request doesn’t change the law or give himself a raise, it simply allocates funding to support terms laid out in the Former Presidents Act of 1958, the Congressional Research Office reports : The President’s FY2017 budget request seeks $3,865,000 in appropriations for expenditures for former Presidents, an increase of $588,000 (17.9%) from the FY2016 appropriation level. The increase in requested appropriations for FY2017 anticipates President Barack Obama’s transition from incumbent to former President. For FY2016, President Obama requested and received appropriations of $3,277,000 for expenditures for former Presidents—an increase of $25,000 from FY2015 appropriated levels. Just to make sure that the spending increases that Obama requested for former presidents wasn’t out of line, we looked at what increases President George W. Bush requested for fiscal year 2009, when he was transitioning to a former president. As it turns out, Bush’s funding increase was very similar to Obama’s, the Congressional Research Service reports : The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2,478,000 for pensions and GSA assistance to former Presidents. The President’s FY2009 budget requested $2,934,000 for expenditures for former Presidents. Pending House and Senate appropriations legislation recommends the requested amount. Bush requested a 15% increase in former presidents spending before he left office, and Obama requested about 18%. But, to be clear, those increases didn’t change the amount either president would received in pensions. The increased funding was to support pensions and benefits laid out in the Former Presidents Act of 1958. So, reports that President Obama gave himself a huge raise before leaving office are false ","Obama"

The story also showed a fake photo of the mansion that Obama was in the middle of purchasing.

Just six months later, t he Navy announced that Williams had been relieved of duty due to “misuse of government computer equipment.” Days later, however, the Navy Times reported that Williams was fired for viewing pornography on his work computer: During a routine inspection, Williams was found to have looked at pornographic images on his government computer, violating Navy rules, said a Navy source familiar with the incident.

"," Claims that 17 gang members burned a white girl alive and that the media has ignored the story are both off base. The rumors started with right-wing websites like Before Its News and Right Wing News reported on December 19, 2015. With headlines like, “17 Black Gang Banger Burned a White Girl Alive … Where Is Obama?” those websites tried to use the story of white teenager who was burned alive to prove that “White Life doesn’t mean @#%!” to President Obama and the mainstream media. Those reports get a few key details wrong, however. For starters, the gang members weren’t arrested in connection with the teen’s murder, which is an important detail. But before we get into that, let’s take a look at the story’s background. Nineteen-year-old Jessica Chambers was found burned to death in Courtland, Mississippi, just after 8 p.m. on December 6, 2014. Authorities say she had been doused in gasoline and set on fire while she sat in her car. Mainstream media outlets like CBS , FOX , NBC and CNN have covered the story extensively. The FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Chambers’ murder and described the investigation as such: Since the discovery of this brutal crime, multiple state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a collaborative investigative effort to identify the person or persons responsible for Jessica’s death. Significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation, and additional rewards have been offered for information relevant to this case. “We continue to solicit the public’s assistance in solving this heinous crime,” stated FBI Special Agent in Charge Donald Alway. “With the public’s help, we are confident that information will be uncovered which will lead to the arrest and successful prosecution of the individual or individuals who cruelly and brutally attacked and killed Jessica Chambers.” Then, on December 18, 2015, news broke that 17 people had been arrested in an operation targeting suspected gang members called “Operation Bite Back.” FBI Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said that the arrests were “a byproduct” of Jessica Chambers’ death investigation — but the arrests were not directly related to Chambers’ death, the local paper reports : Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said Tuesday’s arrests are not directly related to Chambers’ death but to information gathered as authorities have interviewed more than 150 people and sorted through more than 20,000 phone records trying to find her killer. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said as the FBI assisted state and local investigators, suspected illegal activity came to light and resulted in the indictments and arrests Tuesday morning. The indictments in both the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and Mississippi’s 17th Circuit Court District charge the 17 suspects on a variety of violations ranging from child endangerment, possession of stolen firearms, narcotics sales and felon in possession of a firearm to possession of counterfeit currency. It’s not clear how Jessica Chambers’ death investigation led to such a large-scale gang bust, or if authorities suspected any of the gang members of taking part in her murder. So, reports that claim gang members murdered Jessica Chambers are false. And claims that Obama and the media have ignored those reports are false because the FBI hadn’t connected Chambers’ death to the alleged gang members. ","Obama"
"Michelle Obama Said White Folks Are What’s Wrong With America-Fiction!","2015-12-01 12:53:20","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michelle-obama-said-white-folks-are-whats-wrong-with-america/"," There are reports that First Lady Michelle Obama said “white folks are what’s wrong with America” during a speech at Tuskegee University. "," Michelle Obama didn’t say “white folks are what’s wrong with America” in a speech at Tuskegee University. The first lady delivered the commencement address at Tuskegee University in May 2015, and rumors about what she said about “white folks” took off almost immediately. The rumor that Michelle Obama commented about “white folks” can be traced back to a report that appeared at the website Jews News under the headline, “White Folks And America Are the Problem — Michelle Obama Address All Black University With Divisive Message.” According to the report from May 2015: In a speech at Tuskegee University, an institute of higher learning in which white people are “not allowed on the bus,” First Domestic Partner Michelle Obama gave the school’s commencement address with instructions to the future agitators of America to – what else? Go forth and agitate. Her mission is an extension of that of Hussein Obama, to foment unrest and destabilize America. Her message was clear, “whatever is wrong in your life is whitey’s fault, and whitey owes you.” She described the daily persecution inflicted upon her fellow victims at the hands of the plantation owner class as including police discrimination, the “nagging worries that you’re going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason.” Then, Jews News breathed new life into the rumor in November 2015 by recycling its initial account of Michelle Obama’s address at Tuskegee University, this time with the “white folks are what’s wrong with America” twist. In reality, Jews News “editorialized” Michelle Obama’s remarks and interpreted them as “white folks are what’s wrong with America” — but she never actually said that. Michelle Obama’s commencement address at Tuskegee University focused on the school’s founding, its journey into modern times and expectations for her as the first African-American first lady. Then, she concluded by giving Tuskegee graduates advice, which seems to be what Jews News took exception to, according to an official transcrip t: The world won’t always see you in those caps and gowns. They won’t know how hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day — the countless hours you spent studying to get this diploma, the multiple jobs you worked to pay for school, the times you had to drive home and take care of your grandma, the evenings you gave up to volunteer at a food bank or organize a campus fundraiser. They don’t know that part of you. Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world.  And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be.  We’ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives — the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the “help” — and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country. And I know that these little indignities are obviously nothing compared to what folks across the country are dealing with every single day — those nagging worries that you’re going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason; the fear that your job application will be overlooked because of the way your name sounds; the agony of sending your kids to schools that may no longer be separate, but are far from equal; the realization that no matter how far you rise in life, how hard you work to be a good person, a good parent, a good citizen — for some folks, it will never be enough.  (Applause.) So, Michelle Obama didn’t say “white folks are what’s wrong with America,” as reported by Jews News (and other blog sites). Michelle Obama recounted her experience as an African-American — and that’s how Jews News interpreted her remarks. Click here for a video of Michelle Obama’s entire address at Tuskegee University.

"Obama Launches First Salvo in War on Christmas-Fiction!","2015-11-06 08:55:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-launches-first-salvo-in-war-on-christmas-fiction/"," President Obama has issued a military command that will prevent Christmas cards from being delivered to service members stationed overseas, which has been dubbed the first salvo in the war on Christmas. "," President Obama hasn’t launched the first salvo in the war on Christmas, and he hasn’t issued a command that will block Christmas cards sent service members stationed over seas. The false report of Obama launching a war on Christmas started with a fake news website called Fox News The FB Page. The website reported that the White House decided to block delivery of Christmas cards to service members because the holiday greetings would “upset Muslims in host countries.” The story continues: Per executive order,all overseas military mail will be monitored for references to Christmas, Jesus Christ, or pork products which are known to offend Muslims. An Army Veteran who reached out to Fox News said Pentagon leadership is “hypersensitive to anyone who says they feel like their rights are being violated.” “It’s extremely frustrating,” the soldier said. “The U.S. Military is living in fear of radical Muslims.” The soldier, who asked not to be identified because he feared being disciplined or assaulted my Muslims, said many people are furious over the censorship “If soldiers cannot speak the name of God, let alone Christ, what are we fighting for?” he asked. “I’ve towed the company line for years but this has pushed me too far to sit quietly while personal liberties are trampled upon.” Anytime you hear a rumor about an executive order being issued by Obama (or any other future president), double check it on this official White House page . Every executive order that Obama has ever issued is listed there. In this case, Obama’s executive order that “launched the first salvo in the war on Christmas” doesn’t appear on the list, and it was never actually issued. ","Obama"

The first giveaway is that Michelle Obama was wearing a different dress at the event than the white one worn by the woman caught texting.

"Obama Changes Oath of Allegiance for New Americans-Mostly Fiction!","2015-08-06 09:51:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-changes-oath-of-allegiance-for-new-americans/"," President Obama has changed the Oath of Allegiance so that new naturalized citizens don’t have to pledge to take up arms to defend the U.S. "," President Obama hasn’t changed the Oath of Allegiance, but proposed guidance has been issued to clarify who can take an alternate oath under current law. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has long allowed exceptions and accommodations for naturalized citizens who take the Oath of Allegiance. In July 2015, USCIS issued new guidance that said a three-part test should be used to determine who qualifies for these exceptions based on “religious training and belief, or for other reasons of good conscience.” That led to viral reports that President Obama had changed the Oath of Allegiance so new naturalized citizens wouldn’t have to pledge to take up arms to defend the U.S. But in reality, current law already provides those exemptions. New naturalized citizens have been taking the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America since the country was founded. Before 1906, however, there wasn’t a specific text for the oath, and the only guidance was that the applicant: “…shall…declare, on oath…that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to every foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty; and, particularly, by name, to the prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of which he was before a citizen or subject; which proceedings shall be recorded by the clerk of the court.” The Naturalization Act of 1906 was the first step toward changing that. It standardized the naturalization process, required that applicants had “some knowledge of the English language” and established the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization to oversee immigration. After World War I and World War II, immigration and naturalization were viewed as national security issues, and previous naturalization laws were consolidated under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The University of Washington-Bothell summarizes the law : Otherwise known as the McCarran-Walter Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was meant to exclude certain immigrants from immigrating to America, post World War II and in the early Cold War. The McCarran-Walter Act moved away from excluding immigrants based simply upon country of origin. Instead it focused upon denying immigrants who were unlawful, immoral, diseased in any way, politically radical etc. and accepting those who were willing and able to assimilate into the US economic, social, and political structures, which restructured how immigration law was handled. Furthermore, the most notable exclusions were anyone even remotely associated with communism which in the early days of the Cold War was seen as a serious threat to US democracy. The main objective of this was to block any spread of communism from outside post WWII countries, as well as deny any enemies of the US during WWII such as Japan and favor “good Asian” countries such as China. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 set a number of guidelines for the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, but it didn’t spell out the oath’s text: -Support the Constitution; -Renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the applicant was before a subject or citizen; -Support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; -Bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; -Perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; or -Perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law. Today, the text of the Oath of Allegiance can be found in federal codes : I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. These federal codes also outline the alternate version that Obama has been incorrectly attributed to Obama: (b) Alteration of form of oath; affirmation in lieu of oath. In those cases in which a petitioner or applicant for naturalization is exempt from taking the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in its entirety, the inapplicable clauses shall be deleted and the oath shall be taken in such altered form. When a petitioner or applicant for naturalization, by reason of religious training and belief (or individual interpretation thereof), or for other reasons of good conscience, cannot take the oath presc ribed in paragraph (a) of this section with the words “on oath” and “so help me God” included, the words “and solemnly affirm” shall be substituted for the words “on oath,” the words “so help me God” shall be deleted, and the oath shall be taken in such modified form. Any reference to “oath of allegiance” in this chapter is understood to mean equally “affirmation of allegiance” as described in this paragraph. So, President Obama has not changed the Oath of Allegiance for new Americans. Naturalized citizens were already able under law to omit portions of the oath based on “religious training and belief, or for other reasons of good conscience.” USCIS did, however, issue new guidance that “clarifies the eligibility requirements for modifications” of the oath under current law with a three-part test : Three-part Test In order for an applicant to qualify for a modification based on his or her “religious training and belief,” the applicant must satisfy a three-part test. An applicant must establish that: -He or she is opposed to bearing arms in the armed forces or opposed to any type of Service in the armed forces. -The objection is grounded in his or her religious principles, to include other belief systems similar to traditional religion or a deeply held moral or ethical code; and -His or her beliefs are sincere, meaningful, and deeply held. The applicant is not eligible for a modified oath when he or she is opposed to a specific war. Religious training or belief does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views. An applicant whose objection to war is based upon opinions or beliefs about public policy and the practicality or desirability of combat, or whose beliefs are not deeply held, does not qualify for the modification of the oath. Applicant is Not Required to Belong to a Church or Religion In addition, qualification for the exemption is not dependent upon membership in a particular religious group, nor does membership in a specific religious group provide an automatic modification to the oath. The applicant is not required to: -Belong to a specific church or religious denomination; -Follow a particular theology or belief; or -Have religious training. However, the applicant must have a sincere and meaningful belief that has a place in the applicant’s life that is equivalent to that of a religious belief. Because of this belief, for example, the applicant’s conscience may not rest or be at peace if allowed to become an instrument of war. So, in conclusion, Obama hasn’t changed the Oath of Allegiance. Immigration Services has issued guidance to clarify who is eligible to take an alternate oath. USCIS is accepting public comment on these changes through August 4, 2015. Click here for information on how to provide feedback. ","Obama"

"," This one is true, but it’s also outdated. Coach K grabbed headlines in September of 2014 when he commented on President Obama’s military strategy while accepting an award at the Association of the U.S. Army conference. The Daily Beast reports that Coach K told the conference: “I know it’s upsetting to many of you when you hear ‘no boots on the ground.’ It upsets me too, because that’s like saying I’m not going to play two of my best players. Because that’s what you are trained to do. And for decades and decades, the fact that we are a free country and we don’t play home games here is a result of having boots on the ground. That’s the problem. “It’s about letting your opponent know we are going to use our best players. And whether we use them or not, that’s up to the coach. You never tell your opponent you are not going to use (them), like I’m not going to play Grant Hill, J.J. Redick, Christian Laettner.” When national media outlets picked up the story in November of 2104, Coach K backed off and said that he didn’t criticize President Obama’s military strategy, the Charlotte Observer reports : “I’m passionate about the United States military and always will be an amazing supporter of the military. On that night nothing was ever said about President Obama, and nothing was ever said about ISIS. In fact, I hate even saying that word. “I do not hate saying the other word because I love President Obama. It’s amazing that it happened three weeks ago and on Election Day something is brought up and said in a way that I didn’t say. So be it.” It’s true that Coach K never specifically said “Obama” or “ISIS” in his remarks, but it seems obvious where his remarks were aimed. At the time, the term “ boots on the ground ” was at the center of national debate about the U.S. response to ISIS. This eRumor first appeared in 2014, and it reappeared after Duke won the NCAA national championship in 2015.

"," The President’s dog, Bo, and his handler did travel to Maine on a second aircraft when the First Family travelled there in July 2010 for their Summer vacation, but Bo and handler were not alone.  This eRumor surfaced a year later, in 2011, while the President and his family vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard, 367 miles south of the airport where they landed a year earlier. 2013 Vacation Bo prepares for take-off During the President’s 2013 vacation to Martha’s Vineyard, the first pooch once again travel to the vacation spot but this time travelled in class on a MV-22 Osprey. This according to an August 11, 2013 article by England’s The Telegraph .   The article described the Presidential pet’s aircraft as “a hybrid aircraft which takes off like a helicopter but flies like a plane.” Once again, Bo did not have the aircraft to himself.  According to an August 10th article by CBS News , he travelled with White House Staff, media and Secret Service. 2010 Vacation The Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton, Maine is a small airport and can not accommodate large aircraft such as the Boeing 747 that the President uses for Air Force One.   For this reason two aircraft were needed for the entire entourage who accompanied the First Family.

Some time after the story was released the newspaper added a clarification saying, “Today’s story about the arrival of the Obama’s said the Obama’s dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president’s usual jet.” Doug Powers wrote a commentary on that July 17, 2010 news story that appeared in the Morning Sentinel of Central Maine .  It was then posted on the Michelle Malkin website but went viral on the World Wide Web a year later. It appears Mr. Powers and Ms. Malkin posted the commentary prior to the Sentinel clarification, which resulted in the massive flood of emails on the Internet about the celebrity canine named Bo.

"," The federal government has launched a pilot program that will provide training to police departments in six cities, but it’s not true that the departments are being federalized. The six cities will take part in the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice pilot program. The program is part of the “ My Brother’s Keeper ” initiative that President Obama set up in 2014 in an effort to “create opportunities for all young people.” Attorney General Eric Holder said in March of 2015 that the first six cities to take part in the program would be Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Worth, Texas; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Stockton, California: “The Department of Justice is committed to using innovative strategies to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation in communities where trust has been eroded,” said Attorney General Holder.  “By helping to develop programs that serve their own diverse experiences and environments, these selected cities will serve on the leading edge of our effort to confront pressing issues in communities around the country.” According to the Department of Justice, $4.75 million will be used to develop a plan that enhances procedural justice, reduces racial bias and supports reconciliation in these six cities. A board of advisors from academic, law enforcement, faith-based and civil rights backgrounds will lead the program, the DOJ said . The stated goal of the program is to provide technical assistance, research and organizational support to help police departments improve community relations.

"President Obama Talks About Mandatory Voting in the US – Truth!","2015-03-20 18:46:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obama-talks-about-mandatory-voting-in-the-us/"," President Obama said that mandatory voting for U.S. citizens would help make money in politics less powerful. "," It’s true that President Obama talked about mandatory voting at a town hall meeting. But the White House later denied that he planned to make it a law. President Obama was asked about the impact of money in politics at a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 18, 2015. Obama replied that mandatory voting would be one way to make money less powerful: “We shouldn’t be making it harder to vote. We should be making it easier to vote. I’ve said that publicly before. So, my Justice Department is going to be vigorous in terms of trying to force voting rights. I gave a speech down in Selma on the 50th anniversary, and it was incredibly moving for me, and my daughters, and the notion that in this day and age we would be deliberately trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense. At the state and local levels you can push back against that and make sure we’re expanding the franchise, not restricting it. “In Australia, that’s one of the countries that have mandatory voting. It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything. If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country because the people who tend not to vote are young, they’re lower income, they’re skewed more heavily toward immigrant groups and minority groups. They’re often the folks who are scratching and climbing to get into the middle class and working hard. There’s a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls when we should be trying to get them into the polls. So, that may be a better strategy in the short-term.” A day after the president’s remarks, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the president had given an “open-ended answer” to the question. Earnest added that, “The president was not making a specific policy prescription for the United States.” About 40% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. In Australia, voters are required to go to the polls, but they aren’t forced to cast a ballot. About 95% of people turn out for elections there, and the other 5% “may incur a small fine if insufficient excuse is offered,” wrote Haydon Manning, a professor at the University of Rochester.

"Questions about President Obama Long Form Birth Certificate","2015-03-18 21:40:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-birth-certificate/"," Various questions raised about the legitimacy of the long-form birth certificate of President Barack Hussein Obama that was released by the White House on April 27, 2011. "," The image below was released by the White House which it says is of the long-form birth certificate of President Barack Hussein Obama.  Within 24 hours questions from disbelievers speculating on its authenticity and contents began circulating the Internet en masse. We will be looking into more questions and addressing them on this page so please check back often as new eRumors about the President’s birth certificate develop. Here are some of the questions which we have been able to address: Kenya was not called Kenya until it gained its independence from Britain in 1963 so it should not have been identified as so on the birth certificate- Fiction! Kenya got its name from a mountain of the same name where the Kikuyu people who lived in that region called the snow capped mountain “Kirinyaga” or “Kerenyaga,” which meant “mountain of whiteness.”  Mt. Kirinyaga (today Mt. Kenya) was the main landmark of the region and it also became the name of the territory that the British later claimed as their colony.   There was a small problem with the British not being able to pronounce Kirinyaga correctly.  To remedy this the land was simplified to Kenya when it became a protectorate of Great Britain in 1895.  From then on the area was known as Kenya although it was part of the East Africa Protectorate.  In 1920 the protectorate changed its name to the Colony of Kenya.   After close to eight years of violence and uprisings Kenya won their independence from the British in 1963. The Hospital on the birth certificate, “Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital” did not exist until 1978- Fiction! Author Jerome Corsi at World Net Daily wrote an article called “ A Tale Of Two Birth Certificates ” where he compared a 1961 long form certificate similar to the President’s.  Corsi used this birth certificate for his evaluation of the President’s birth certificate. The hospital named on both certificates appear to be exactly the same. The “Rosetta Stone” Long Form Certificate of Live Birth from Jerome Corsi’s article A Brief History of Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital In 1890, using inherited land from her deceased sister on the condition it would be used to help Hawaiian maternity mothers, Queen Kapiʻolani, raised $8,000 and founded the Kapiʻolani Home of the Hoolu and Hoola Lahui Society. Throughout the years the needs of mothers having babies grew and more property needed to be acquired and eventually in 1918 the home moved to a two-story house with 25 beds. It was then when the name was first changed to the Kapiʻolani Maternity Home and for the first time the doors were opened to all women, not just Hawaiians. In 1929, as the needs continued to grow the home moved again to a larger building with 50 beds and expanded its mission to the study and treatment of non-infectious gynecological problems. Three years later, in 1931, the name was changed to the Kapiʻolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital. This is the name of the facility that appeared on the long form certificate of live birth of Barack Hussein Obama II. The hospital kept this name until 1971, ten years after the birth of Barack Obama, when they changed its name to Kapiʻolani Hospital. Between 1929 and 1977 this facility delivered 145,000 babies. The number on the long form birth certificate is different from the number on the document released in 2008- Fiction! Both numbers the 2008 birth certificate and the long form birth certificate are identical. The original image of the 2008 birth certificate was blacked out when it was released on Barack H. Obama’s  Fight the Smears web site.   The 2008 document was examined by the FactCheck,org website and an image of it was posted on their Internet site displaying the number of the birth certificate of the President.

"Obama’s tax proposals-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:41:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/taxes-election/"," A forward email that lists what it says are Barack Obama’s tax proposals if he were elected president. "," This eRumor is a recycled version of one that circulated in March, 2008, about both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  It resurfaced as an Obama eRumor in July, 2008. CAPITAL GAINS, DIVIDENDS Regarding capital gains taxes, Senator Obama has talked in terms of raising capital gains taxes, perhaps as high as 28%, but that would not apply to homes.  U.S. News and World Report’s money and politics blogger James Pethokoukis said that Obama is in favor of a significant increase as part of his “Tax Fairness for the Middle Class” plan.  In an interview with CNBC in March, 2008, Obama said that he favored raising capital gains taxes from %15% to 20% but no higher than 28% Both Obama and McCain favor exempting the first $250,000 of gains from the sale of a primary residence ($500,000 for a married couple on a joint return). So to say that Obama is proposing a 28% capital gains tax on residences is incorrect. The eRumor claims that taxes on dividends would go up to 39.6%.  That is a fabricated number.  Neither candidate has ever advocated a 39.6% tax on anything.  As stated above, Obama talking in terms of raising capital gains, including dividends, to 20% and no higher than 28%. INCOME TAX The forwarded email than lists what income taxes would look like under McCain and Obama.  There is no question that the Obama Democratic proposals will result in higher taxes than McCain’s Republican proposals, but the eRumor reports erroneous numbers. The eRumor starts off giving the wrong figures for current taxes.  Here are the numbers from the eRumor compared with the actual tax rates for 2008 from the Internal Revenue Service site: Single making 30K – tax $4,500——– Actually $4,100 Single making 50K – tax $12,500—— Actually $8,845 Single making 75K – tax $18,750—— Actually $15,094 Married making 60K- tax $9,000——- Actually $8,198 Married making 75K – tax $18,750—- Actually $11,438 Married making 125K – tax $31,250– Actually $23,938 Regarding a comparison of Obama and McCain tax proposals, the Chicago Sun-Times put together its figures in June, 2008. By their estimates, for example, a person with taxable income of $19,000 or less would pay $597 less under Obama and $19 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of $19,000 to $38,000 per year would pay $892 less under Obama’s plan and $113 less under McCain’s. A person with taxable income between $112,000 and $227,000 would pay $2,300 less under Obama and $3,200 less under McCain. A person with taxable income of  $227,000 would pay $23,000 more under Obama and $15,000 less under McCain. INHERITANCE TAX The eRumor says that the inheritance tax was repealed under George W. Bush, which is not true, although there have been numerous attempts to repeal it. According to the Chicago Sun-Times article, McCain would seek to lower the inheritance tax while Obama would raise it on estates more than $3.5 million. Updated 7/18/08 ","Obama"

In the days following the announcement several news agencies have reported that President Obama issued an executive order that bypassed Congress to allow more than 800,000 young people to remain legally in the U.S. without fear of being deported but there has yet to be official executive order on the White House web site. Click for White House Executive Order page. The Dream Act: The Dream Act is a bill that was fist introduced in the Senate back in 2001.  This bill would grant conditional permanent resident status for certain long-term residents who entered the united states as children, if they met certain criteria. The word DREAM is an acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. The Hill, a newspaper that reports on the daily business in Congress while it is in session, has been following the progress of this act and in a May 11, 2011 article said the Dream Act would include immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children. According to the text of the Dream Act, some of the conditions that must be met by immigrants are that they must currently be residing in the United States and have a “good moral character during the entire period of conditional permanent resident status.”  Eligibility can also be granted to those who have “acquired a degree from an institution of higher education in the United States or has completed at least 2 years, in good standing, in a program for a bachelor’s degree or higher degree in the United States.”  There is also a condition for those who have served or are currently serving in the U. S. Military for at least 2 years.  If they are no longer serving and have been discharged they must show proof of an honorable discharge. Over the years, the bill has failed to pass in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which are the two necessary steps for a bill before it can be signed into law by the President.  The Dream act has been brought up a number of times since 2001.  The last time, in 2010 before the 111th Congress under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi.  Congress passed the bill on December 8, 2010 but it was met by tough opposition from the Senate according to an article posted that day in The Hill .

"," The report from the Judicial Watch organization is real, according to an October 4, 2011 press release found on their website. Under the Freedom of Information Act, Judicial Watch filed a request on June 28, 2011 inquiring about transportation records, passenger manifests and mission tasking for Michelle Obama’s June 2011 trip to Africa. The group posted their findings: According to U.S. Department of Defense’s published hourly rates for the C-32A aircraft used for the trip, Judicial Watch calculated the total cost to American taxpayers was $424,142 for use of the aircraft (34.8 flight hours x $12,188 per hour). (The C-32 is a specially configured military version of the Boeing 757.) Other expenses – meals (off the plane), transportation, security, various services, etc. – have yet to be disclosed.” The passenger manifests confirm the presence of Obama’s daughter’s, Malia and Sasha on the trip. The two girls are listed as “Senior Staff.” The manifests also list Mrs. Obama’s mother, Marian Robinson, and niece and nephew, Leslie and Avery Robinson, as well Mrs. Obama’s makeup and hairstylist (Carl Ray and Johnny Wright). The expense records also show $928.44 was spent for “bulk food” purchases on flight. Overall, during the trip, 192 meals were served for the 21 passengers on board. The White House disputed the Judicial Watch report, according to an ABC article released on that same day , saying that  “a number of assertions made by the group are in error.” A White House senior official told ABC that “The Obama daughters were not listed as Senior Staff – that only designates the area of the plane where they were seated.”   The spokesperson added that the “Air Force categorizes the passengers by compartment on the plane.” As for the cost of the trip the official told ABC “The number stated is misconstrued and out of context. The hourly rate is not the marginal cost of operating the plane — it is an accounting figure that prices in a number of fixed costs from maintaining the Air Force fleet for this kind of plane over a year. For example, it includes estimated replacement parts, depreciation, repairs, and costs that would have been incurred regardless of this flight.” The White House official also told ABC that although there were five to seven official business events planned throughout the day the private safari “was designated as a private event and paid for personally.” Posted 05/15/13 ","Obama"

Adams made some inquiries and was informed by his boss that there was no record of the birth for candidate Obama. During the 2008 Presidential Campaign there were conflicting reports as to the Honolulu hospital where Obama had been born, Queen’s Medical Center or Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women and Children.  Adams said that his office made inquiries with both facilities and was told, “We don’t have a birth certificate for him.”  Adams also said that “they told my supervisor, either by phone or by e-mail, neither one has a document that a doctor signed off on saying they were present at this man’s birth.” Case Filed By Dr. Orly Taitz Update December 21, 2009: Dr. Orly Taitz is an attorney who filed a lawsuit in Southern California  questioning the authenticity of the birth certificate of President Barack Obama.  The lawsuit was filed on the day Obama was sworn into the office of the President.  Dr. Taitz told TruthOr Fiction.Com that the latest version eRumor involving Supreme Court Justice Scalia is a fabrication.

The AP Story About Occidental College Transcripts Release Update May 5 2009: A new Obama citizenship story story claiming to be from the Associated Press saying that a group called “Americans for Freedom of  Information” released copies of Occidental College transcripts showing that the “Fulbright Foundation” had awarded Barack Obama, under the name of Barry Soetoro, financial aid to attend Occidental College.  This claims to be the “Smoking Gun” to the rumor about his natural born citizen status.   The eRumor began circulating in April 2009 and by the end of the month reached critical mass.  There is no such story by the Associated press and looking at the dateline this appears to be an April Fools joke. An Occidental College spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that President Obama’s records are still sealed and no such transcripts have been released.   When asked if the future President used the Obama or Soetoro name at the college, the spokesperson said that although he had not seen the sealed transcripts he had seen a 1981 photo book that was handed out to students and faculty at the beginning of the college year with student photos, names and hometown information.  The 1981 photo book had “Barack Obama” under the student’s photo and indicated a home state as Hawaii. There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree.  The program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and each year awards approximately 7,500 grants.  The grants are for both American students who want to study abroad and foreign students who want to study in the US.  To be eligible certain criteria must be met. Click for Fulbright information. eRumor History: The Obama citizenship story began circulating during the 2008 presidential campaign and attracted a lot of interest, but on October 24, 2008, the judge in the case dismissed the lawsuit saying that the man who filed it lack standing and that any harm from an allegedly ineligible candidate was “too vague and its effects too attenuated to confer standing on any and all voters.”    Attorney Phillip Berg has announced that he will be appealing the dismissal of his case to the United States Supreme Court. The WorldNetDaily web site has reported that “More than a half-dozen legal challenges have been filed in federal and state courts demanding President-elect Barack Obama’s decertification from ballots or seeking to halt elector meetings, claiming he has failed to prove his U.S. citizenship status.” An online petition has been set up by  “Rally Congress”,  a non profit group “dedicated to helping people and groups communicate more effectively with elected officials”,  they say that they have collected over 108,000 signatures and letters. These numbers have grown considerably since the election. Click for petition. On November 18, 2008,  the America’s Independent Party (AIP) announced that Presidential candidate Alan Keyes and the party have filed a law suit with the California Superior court to keep Secretary of the State of CA, Debra Brown, from certifying the names of the electors to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, until proof of Barack Obama’s U.S. Citizenship is verified. Click for AIP release. On November 1, 2008 the Associated Press released a report saying that state officials in Hawaii “have personally verified that the health department holds Obama’s original birth certificate.”  Hawaiian Health Department Director Dr. Chiyome Fukino and Alvin Onaka, who is the registrar of vital statistics both reviewed the original document. The suit had been filed by Philip Berg ,  a Pennsylvania attorney who described himself as a lifelong Democrat, the former Democratic Chairman of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, an 8-year member of the state democratic committee, a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and a past candidate for both governor of Pennsylvania and United States Senator. Berg filed the suit in federal court on August 21, 2008 claiming that Barack Obama was not eligible to be president of the United States because he was not a “natural born” citizen of the United States, which is required by the Constitution.  He asked that the court demand Obama and the Democratic National Committee to provide documentation proving he was eligible to be president..  He also asked for a temporary restraining order asking that Obama’s campaign be halted. At issue was whether Barack Obama was ever an American citizen by birth, even if he is an American citizen whether he was a “natural born” citizen as the constitution requires for the president, and whether he ever lost his U.S. citizenship and, if so, whether he ever got it back. An Internet video began circulating based on an interview with Berg.  It was titled October Surprise and outlined Bergs contentions about Obama’s birth. Most of this is has yet to be proven but in his lawsuit, Berg alleges: That Obama was not born in Hawaii, as he claims, but was actually born in Kenya, his father’s homeland. That Obama’s mother was in Kenya in the late stages of her pregnancy and airlines at the time would not let her fly back to Hawaii at such an advanced time of pregnancy. That Obama’s grandmother on his father’s side, a half brother, and a half sister all say Obama was born in Kenya.  In October, 2008, Berg announced that he had a recording of the grandmother talking about the birth and that she was in the birth room when it took place. That Obama was born on August 4, 1961 but his birth was not registered in Hawaii until August 8, 1961 and that the registration and a Honolulu newspaper announcement of the birth were fabricated. That there is not agreement in Obama’s family about what hospital in which he was allegedly born in Hawaii. That according to Wayne Madison, a journalist with Online Journal, a GOP research team sent to Mombosa, Kenya, found a certificate registering the birth of Barack Obama, Jr. at a maternity hospital indicating his birth to a Kenyan father and a U.S. mother. That if he was born in Kenya, he cannot be a U.S. citizen because the law stated that his mother would have had to have lived 10-years in the United States, 5 of which were after the age of 14.  Since she was 18 at the time of Obama’s birth, she did not meet the residency requirements for passing U.S. citizenship to Obama. That when Obama’s mother married an Indonesian man and took Obama to Indonesia when he was 6-years old, he would have lost his U.S. citizenship and become Indonesian.  Indonesia at the time did not recognize dual citizenship. That when Obama was registered to attend school in Indonesia, the registration form listed him as “Barry Soetoro” (his stepfather’s last name), listed him as Indonesian, and listed is faith as Islam. That according to the law at the time, Obama’s mother would have lost her U.S. citizenship by marrying an Indonesian and living in Indonesia.  Four years later she returned to Hawaii and divorced her Indonesian husband.  Berg said that she could have regained her U.S. citizenship by taking an oath of allegiance to the United States but that there is no record that she did.  Therefore, Obama would not have been able to regain his own citizenship until the age of 18 and himself take an oath of allegiance to the U.S.  Berg said there is no record of that ever happening.  Berg concludes that not only may Obama not be eligible to be president, but that he may be an illegal alien. That Obama traveled to Pakistan at the age of 20 and traveled using an Indonesian passport.  Had he regained his U.S. citizenship, according to Berg, he would have traveled using a U.S. passport. In response to questions about his birth, Obama posted a birth certificate on his campaign website, but Berg contends that it is a forgery and that forensic experts have determined that it is a altered version of the birth certificate of Obama’s half sister, Maya Kasandra Soetoro, who was born in Indonesia but whose birth record was also forged to make it appear that she was born in Hawaii. That when Obama registered for the Illinois Bar he lied and said “none” when asked about any former names. Berg said that Obama’s lawyers were dragging their feet in providing proof of Obama’s birth and citizenship and that means “he’s a total fraud, he’s a phony, and that means he should be arrested, tried, and deported. An eRumor got started at the beginning of October 2008, saying that the judge in the Berg case, had issued an order for Obama to produce his original birth certificate, but that was false. An article by Jon Dryer was posted on NewsWithViews.com, which has since been retracted. In it, Dryer claimed that Judge R. Barclay Surrick had made a decision in the case and had ordered Obama to present the court with evidence that he is an American citizen. The Berg lawsuit was the latest in a series of challenges about the birth of the Democratic nominee for president, which he lists as having taken place in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. The first was an eRumor that said that Hawaii was not a state when he was born so therefore he is not a “natural born” citizen. That one was Fiction! Hawaii was a state in 1961 and it would not have mattered because prior to that it was a U.S. Territory, which would have still qualified him as “natural born.” CLICK for more on that story.

In the latest chapter of this saga of Berg vs Obama, Philip Berg has issued a press release that said “Obama & DNC Admit All Allegations of Federal Court Lawsuit – Obama’s ‘Not’ Qualified to be President Obama Should Immediately Withdraw his Candidacy for President.” According to his website, “Berg stated that he filed Requests for Admissions on September 15, 2008 with a response by way of answer or objection had to be served within thirty [30] days.

"," Obama has used several different airplanes during his campaign but towards the end of his 2008 Presidential run he was flying aboard a Boeing 757 chartered from North American Airlines.  This eRumor resurfaced once again while he was running for his second term and some version say that the official jet of the President of the United States, Air Force One, had been converted with his campaign logo.  That is fiction.

"," This eRumor appeared all over the Internet in November, 2011 and on various political web sites but it was not found on any major news sites. The email says only that is was authored by someone named Rich Carroll but does not identify him beyond that. Let us look some of the topics in the article one at a time: First President to refuse to show a valid birth certificate – Disputed ! Although there are those who dispute its validity, candidate Obama released  of his birth certificate in 2008 and it was displayed on his Fight the Smears web site when questions about his citizenship were raised.   Critics alleged that the document was a fake, or insufficient as proof for the office of the President. This stirred a frenzy of rumors including emails that contained faked documents including one made up to look like birth certificates from Kenya. Tow years later, in 2010, President Obama released what he said was his original long form birth certificate, from the state of Hawaii.. We have a page on the questionable citizenship of Barack Obama complete with photos of documents. Click for our findings. First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner- Fiction! This rumor originated from an April Fools Joke in 2009 featuring an alleged Associated Press story that said that Barack Obama received a grant from the “Fulbright Foundation” when he attended Occidental College in California.  There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. Click for our Findings First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in- Fiction! Rumors about Obama’s Social Security Number began circulating in 2010 alleging that the number belonged to a deceased man who immigrated to the U.S. from France and resided in Hawaii.   That proved to be fiction.   This sparked additional inquires as to why the President’s Social Security Number began with 042, the three digit classification for Connecticut.   According to the Social Security Administration, “The Area Number is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office.” Click for Social Security site First President to preside over a cut to the credit rating of the United States. – Truth! On August 5, 2011, for the first time in the history of this nation, Standard and Poor’s downgraded the US Credit Rating to one notch below AAA.  According to a Washington Post article dated that same day, “the credit rating company said ‘political brinkmanship’ in the debate over the debt had made the U.S. government’s ability to manage its finances ‘less stable, less effective and less predictable.’ It said the bipartisan agreement reached this week to find at least $2.1 trillion in budget savings ‘fell short’ of what was necessary to tame the nation’s debt over time and predicted that leaders would not be likely to achieve more savings in the future.” First President to violate the War Powers Act – Fiction! The War Powers Resolution of 1973 became federal law to prevent a president from committing the United States to an armed conflict without the approval from Congress. This law requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing  U.S. armed forces to military action.   It also limits U.S. involvement to no more than 60 days.  In 2011 President Obama bypassed congressional approval for going into Libya, but he was not the first U.S. President to do so. The War Powers Resolution was first disregarded by President Clinton in 1999, during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. – Truth! The President did order a moratorium on offshore drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet after the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. The moratorium was struck down by New Orleans Judge Martin Feldman and according to a February 3, 2011 article in Bloomberg the Obama Administration was acting in contempt by continuing the policy.  Felman’s comments on the ruling were reported in the article.  He said, “Each step the government took following the court’s imposition of a preliminary injunction showcases its defiance.”  Feldman added, “Such dismissive conduct, viewed in tandem with the re-imposition of a second blanket and substantively identical moratorium, and in light of the national importance of this case, provide this court with clear and convincing evidence of the government’s contempt.” First President to defy a Federal Judges court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.- Fiction! The constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been questioned by several courts in various states in the US since it was passed into law in March 21, 2010.  According to an August 12, 2011 article in Reuters a U.S. Appeals Court for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta ruled that it was unconstitutional to require all Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty but it unanimously reversed a lower court decision that threw out the entire law. First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. If the writer of the eRumor had in mind the Affordable Care Act then this would be Truth! .  When the law makers wrote the HR-3590 bill,  the Democratic majority House and Senate quickly passed it and the President signed it into law. It is doubtful that anybody in government who supported this bill actually read it,  Buried inside the 2409 pages of the “Obamacare” law there is a stipulation known as the “Individual Mandate,” where the Internal Revenue Service will collect a 2.5% penalty from tax returns not showing proof of enrollment of health insurance. First President to spend a trillion dollars on shovel-ready jobs and later admit there was no such thing as shovel-ready jobs.- Inaccurate! According to a September 26, 2011 article in Politico , President Obama did use the term “Shovel Ready Jobs” in a plan to fund $50 billion in improvements to highways, transit systems, railways and aviation. The idea was to put Americans back to work by construction upgrades to  150,000 miles of road, 4,000 miles of train tracks, 150 miles of airport runways and the nation’s air traffic control system. Political reported that experts did not see the jobs being as shovel ready as one would think as ” A tremendous amount of money and time is needed to get a project through a detailed design process, permitting, environmental hurdles, public hearings and land acquisition.” First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.- Under Investigation First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.

First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S. , including those with criminal convictions- Fiction! This was not done is secret and according to an August 18, 2011 ABC News report , “ The Obama administration announced a major change in policy for thousands of illegal immigrants going through deportation proceedings. They now may be able to stay in the country. There are currently 300,000 deportation cases making their way through the federal immigration courts, but under the new policy immigrants classified as low-priority cases could be granted a stay and a chance to apply for a work permit.” First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to terminate Americas ability to put a man in space. Fiction! According to the St. Petersburg Times PolitiFact Check site, “Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of “first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space” — not Obama.”  The Apollo program ended in 1975 and had a five year gap in space launches until the Space Shuttle program was in full operation. First President to encourage racial discrimination and intimidation at polling places. – Unproven! On November 4, 2008 Black Panthers were spotted outside a polling place in Philadelphia, PA.  One of the Black Panthers was holding a night stick.   A YouTube Video taken by a local journalism student of an account with them went viral on the Internet and news outlets.  A short time later, police arrived on the scene and they were removed from the scene.  Charges of voter intimidation were charged but they were dropped by the Justice Department under the leadership of Eric Holder, according to an August 20, 2009  article in the Wall Street Journal.  No explanation was given by Holder or anyone at the Department of Justice.  The accusation that the President encouraged this incident remains unproven. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.- Truth! According to a May 22, 2011 article in the New York Times this was a historical first when the President extended the Patriot Act by autopen during a weeklong trip in Europe. First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.- Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly speak-out on the reasons for their rate increases.- Under Investigation First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state they are allowed to locate a factory.- Truth! On April 20, 2011 the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint against the Boeing claiming that the aircraft manufacturer opened up a second 787 Dreamliner production line in South Carolina in retaliation against the union.  South Carolina is a “right to work state.” On  September 23, 2011 Politico.com reported that , “An Obama appointee is now asking a judge to order Boeing to relocate all 787 Dreamliner production to Washington state — a move that’s feeding the GOP narrative that Obama’s Big Government is meddling with job creation, just as the first plane nears its first commercial flight.” First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN)- Fiction! The oath of the President of the United States does not have any conditions to protect U.S. States.   The oath of office is in the U.S. Constitution and it says, “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” First President to withdraw an existing coal permit that had been properly issued years ago.- Under Investigation First President to fire an inspector general of Ameri-corps for catching one of his friends in a corruption case.- Under Investigation First President to appoint 45 Czars to replace elected officials in his office.- Under Investigation First President to golf 73 separate times in his first two and a half years in office.- Inaccurate! According to a June 26, 2011 White House Dossier article, written by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler, President Obama played his 75th golf game since being sworn into office.  No doubt at the time of this writing the number is greater. According to an October 24, 2009 article in Politico , Obama was in office about 10 months when he played his 24th golf game, tying his predecessor, G. W. Bush, for the number of golf games.  It took Bush almost 3 years to play that number of games. First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records . – Fiction! There are no U.S. laws stating that a U.S. President or presidential candidate disclose his medical or educational background.   In his books, Barack Obama wrote about his life in Indonesia.  Questions about Obama’s travels could have been sparked by a  rumor that was spread on YouTube by Reverend James Manning of the ATLAH church in Harlem.  Manning alleged that Obama, while attending Columbia University (Class of 1983), was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to be the operative in an arms deal with the Taliban. Manning said that Obama was selected because he was fluent in Farsi and Middle Eastern customs.   President only speaks English fluently, has never learned Farsi and the Taliban did not exist until 1989. First President to win a Nobel Peace Prize for doing NOTHING to earn it. Disputed! The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Barack Obama on October 9, 2009 after he had been in office approximately 9 months. According to the Nobel Peace Prize website Obama was awarded this, “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”.  On January 20, 2010 Britain’s The Guardian released a timeline showing the major events during the President’s fist year in office.    In April 2009, Obama flew to England for the G-20 conference where he not only met with Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Gordon Brown but also met with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to discuss U.S. and Russian relations. First President to coddle American enemies while alienating Americas allies- Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to publicly bow to Americas enemies while refusing to salute the U.S. Flag. Fiction! President Obama has been photographed bowing to foreign leaders during formal introductions.  One of these leaders was Saudi Arabian King Abdullah.  The U.S. is at war with a radical terrorist organization based in the Middle East called al-Queda, and neither Saudi Arabia or King Abdullah are considered an enemy of the U.S.   Obama does not always follow the protocol of placing his hand over his heart when the National Anthem is played.

Obama did travel overseas and during his speeches make apologies for past American policies and arrogance.  Former George W. Bush campaign manager, Karl Rove wrote an opinion on April 23, 2009 in the Wall Street Journal calling the Presidents trip an “Apology Tour”. In a  June 17, 2009 Human Events article, attributed to Niles Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative newspaper listed ten apologies by President Obama: 1 . Apology to Europe: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In America, there’s a failure to appreciate Europe‘s leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.” 2. Apology to the Muslim world: Interview with Al Arabiya, January 27. “My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.” 3. Apology to the Summit of the Americas: Address to the Summit of the Americas, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, April 17. “While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms.” 4. Apology at the G-20 Summit of World Leaders: News conference in London, April 2. “I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.” 5. Apology for the War on Terror: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight, that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.” 6. Apology for Guantanamo in France: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In dealing with terrorism, we can’t lose sight of our values and who we are. That’s why I closed Guantanamo. That’s why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogation practices. I don’t believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when you start sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.” 7. Apology for America before the Turkish Parliament: Speech to the Turkish Parliament, Ankara, Turkey, April 6. “The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history.

"Jesus named the Antichrist—and it’s Barack Obama-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-antichrist-video/"," A video on the Internet from an unnamed person that suggests that a behind-the-scenes look at the languages Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew reveals that in the Bible in Luke 10:18, Jesus may have revealed the name of the Antichrist. The video suggests that it’s Barack Obama. "," The Antichrist, according to many Christian teachers, is a person who will fulfill Biblical prophesy by becoming a powerful leader in the world but will be an evil ruler, a false messiah, a person who is either against or the opposite of Jesus Christ. TuthOrFiction.com has not found any scholar of Greek, Aramaic, or Hebrew who can vouch for the interpretation of Luke 10:18 pointing to Barack Obama. The video is based entirely on the verse in Luke 10:18 , in which Jesus says, “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” KJV The video says that the words in the verse were translated into English from the Greek New Testament, but were spoken by Jesus in Aramaic. It also says that Aramaic is “the most ancient form of Hebrew.” It goes on to say that the Hebrew word for “lightning” is “baraq.” Then the video goes to the book if Isaiah in the Bible, chapter 14:14 where Satan is quoted as saying “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high.” According to the video, there are several references to Satan as having fallen from the “heights” or the “heavens” and that the Hebrew word used for heights is “bamah.” Further, according to the video, there are conditions in Hebrew in which “bamah” would have sometimes been pronounced “U-bamah” or “O-bamah” and would have been translated literally as “Lightening from the heights.” Therefore “Baraq U-Bamah” or “O-bamah.” To get some insight into these claims, TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Tom Finley, Professor of Old Testament and Semitics and Chair, Old Testament and Semitics Department at Talbot Theological Seminary in La Mirada , California . Let’s look at them one at a time: Dr. Finley says that most scholars agree that Jesus probably spoke and taught in Aramaic, but that there is debate on that topic. He did point out that it is not accurate to say that “Aramaic is the most ancient form of Hebrew?” Not at all. According to Dr. Finley, Hebrew and Aramaic are two distinct languages, although closely related. He confirmed that the word for lightning is indeed “baraq” in Hebrew. In Aramaic it’s “beraq.” Dr. Finley said that in Hebrew “bama” means “back,” “hill,” or “high place, place of worship” (Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament). In Isaiah 14:14 the term refers to “the heights of the clouds” (KJV) or “the back of a cloud” (a Jewish translation called Tanakh) or “the tops of the clouds” (NRSV). However, he said that the normal word for “heavens” in Hebrew is “shamayim,” and that is the word used in Isaiah 14:12 (“How you are fallen from heaven.”) “Even if we granted that bama could mean “heaven” by itself (that is, without adding a word like “clouds” after it),” Dr. Finley said, “the combination that the video makes, “baraq u/o bama,” could only mean “lightning and heaven,” not “lightning from heaven” or “the heights”). Further, according to Dr. Finley, “What Jesus said in Luke 10:18 was, in the KJV, “Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” If he spoke it in Aramaic, then “from heaven” should be “min shemayya.” If Hebrew it should be “mehashamayim.” It is impossible that he would have used “bama” for “heaven,” whether in Hebrew or Aramaic. In Greek it is “ek tou ouranou.” And of course this doesn’t address how to account for “and” in the alleged name “baraq u/o bama.” Dr. Finley concluded, “Someone has been playing around with these languages in a rather silly way.” ","Obama"

"," Lou Pritchett is the author of this opinion and told TruthorFiction.com that he submitted this to the New York Times under the title of  “Obama, You Scare Me” but they never published it. Pritchett did say that his article managed to make it to the world wide web where circulation went ballistic. Pritchett is a former vice president of Procter & Gamble and wrote “Stop Paddling and Start Rocking the Boat” as well as numerous books and periodicals. Sometime in April 2012, Pritchett wrote a follow up to his opinion saying that President Obama “no longer scares me, he terrifies me.” Video of Lou Pritchett reading his letter found on YouTube We found Pritchett’s second letter posted, by him, on the July 11, 2012 online edition of the Topanga News : I was born in year two of the Great Depression (1931) and spent the first 10 years of my life influenced by the extreme hardships of the depression. By today’s standards my family was about a mile below today’s so-called ‘poverty level’ but if you never ‘had,’ doing without was not so ‘bad.’ Borrowing shoes to graduate from the 8th grade didn’t seem at all demeaning because most of the 8th graders did the same thing. In June 1944, my only brother, Joe, was killed in action on Utah Beach in Normandy, France during the D-Day landings. Exactly one year later, my father died and left me, my mother and my sister to go it alone… and alone we went. My mother went to work at a department store, my sister dropped out of school and joined her and I went to work shining shoes on the streets of Memphis for a dime a shine. Government assistance was not available, and if it were, I am confident my mother would have refused it because she never wanted the government involved in our lives. I mention this bit of personal history to help you understand that millions of Americans, including your parents and grandparents, grew up like me during the Great Depression and never expected nor wanted the government to offer them anything other than an opportunity. And now to see what Obama is trying to do to our country, can make you crazy. As some of you know, my “Scare Me” letter went viral with millions of hits on the internet during the past three years. I have now written a follow-up letter which I will now share with you: In April 2009, I sent President Obama and the New York Times a letter titled “You Scare Me” because, as a candidate, he promised to “fundamentally transform America.” Now, after observing his performance for over three years, he no longer scares me—he terrifies me for the following reasons: FIRST: He has done more to damage America’s standing in the world, to lower the standard of living in America, to impoverish future generations and to shake our faith in the country’s future than any other American president in history. SECOND: With a compliant Democrat congress, a lapdog media and a weak, almost nonexistent Republican opposition, he has shattered the American dream of job security, home ownership and rugged individualism for millions of Americans and has poisoned and divided our civil society with his politics of envy, class warfare, race warfare, and religious warfare which he is using as fundamental building blocks for his ‘socialist’ agenda. THIRD: Culturally, he remains totally out of touch with traditional American values. This has absolutely nothing to do with race or where he was born, rather it has everything to do with where, how and with whom he was raised, schooled, educated, trained and associates with still today. FOURTH: He has surrounded himself with naive academicians, lawyers, politicians, bureaucrats and socialist-leaning czars who arrogantly think and behave exactly as he does. People who offer no balanced suggestions or devils advocate positions and think in lock-step with him that big government is the answer to all our problems. FIFTH: He not only encourages but aids and abets in the unionization of all American industry, the albatross around the neck of the free market. In turn, they provide the money and muscle to intimidate his opponents. SIXTH: He has increased the national debt by over 30% in just three years. If re-elected and this rate of increase continues, America will be burdened with an unsustainable $20 trillion dollar debt which will result in the country’s financial death. Recovery will be impossible – America will be the Greece of 2016. SEVENTH: Given his fanatical adherence to the ‘environmental’ and ‘man-caused global warming’ fringe, he has deliberately discouraged U.S. fossil fuel exploration and production while wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on solar, wind and algae experiments. He refuses to accept that oil, gas and coal are not America’s enemies, they are America’s assets which, if properly managed, could make us energy independent within a generation. EIGHTH: He views the U.S. as a power in retreat which abused its World dominance. Therefore, he systematically apologizes round the world. Last March he whispered to Russian President Medvedev “… this is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.” Just what is the secret that Obama and Putin are concealing from the American people until after the election? With what other leaders has he made similar secret agreements? NINTH: And finally, after all his missteps, bad decision making, poor management, and zero leadership, the fact that he has the audacity to seek re-election should terrify every American. I predict that if re-elected, future historians and political interpreters will look back at the eight year period 2008-2016, and conclude “the 44th President of the U.S. allowed the takers to overpower the payers which resulted in the greatest economy in history vanishing from the face of the Earth.” Farewell, America. The World will really miss you!” It is my hope and prayer that this letter will also go viral and serve as a ‘wake up’ call to Americans of all political leaning, convincing them that never before in U.S. history has so much depended on Americans understanding that we are facing one of the greatest crises in U.S. history. Convincing them that this election will be won not by letters to the editor, political speeches or radio and TV soundbites. No!!! it will be won by those with a conviction, with a belief and with a willingness to pay the price in helping put the most enlightened voters in the polling booth on November 6. Let me end on my favorite quote which I think is very appropriate for each of us today: “TO EVERY MAN THERE COMES IN HIS LIFETIME THAT SPECIAL MOMENT WHEN HE IS PHYSICALLY TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER AND OFFERED THE CHANCE TO DO A VERY SPECIAL THING, UNIQUE TO HIM AND FITTED TO HIS TALENT; WHAT A TRAGEDY IF THAT MOMENT FINDS HIM UNPREPARED OR UNQUALIFIED FOR THE WORK WHICH WOULD BE HIS FINEST HOUR.” Those words, spoken by Winston Churchill over 70 years ago, are very appropriate for the Tea Party Movement today. For if each of us is prepared and is qualified then November 6, 2012, just might be our and our Country’s finest hour as we reclaim this “shining city on the hill” from the ravages of Obama Socialism.

The eRumor refers to the Presidential desk as the “Resolute Desk,” which is how the famous desk is known. The desk got its name because it was made of the wood from the HMS Resolute, a British sailing ship. In 1852 the HMS Resolute set off on a 2 – 3 year mission along with four other ships to the Arctic.  This was a mission to  investigate the disappearance of two ships, the Erebus and Terror, which left England in 1845 in search of the North West Passage. As planned, the rescue ship became trapped by ice twice which carried them closer to their destination.  Eventually, the crew protected the vessel from the elements and continued on their mission on foot. The abandoned British ship that was found 1200 miles from where her crew left her by the U.S. whaling ship George Henry in 1855.  The George Henry crew managed to free the entrapped Resolute and sailed the salvaged prize back to New England where she was sold to the American government. As a gesture of peace and esteem Resolute was repaired, refitted and eventually returned to England.  In 1878 the ship was decommissioned and Queen Victoria ordered a desk to be fashioned from the wood of the Resolute.  She presented this desk as a gift to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880. According to the White House Museum web site, every president since Hayes has used the Resolute Desk either in the Oval Office or a private study in the Executive Mansion with the exception of Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. President Franklin Roosevelt requested that a panel be installed at the front of the desk to hide his braces and wheelchair but the panel project was not finished until after he died.   President Truman was in office when the panel was installed.

This quote does not exist in either of Obama’s books. “There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.”- Truth! This is a quote from Dreams from My Father. It it in a section in which Obama describes a job interview with a man in Chicago.  Race had been a part of their discussion and the full quote is, “There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe.  And white—he’d said himself that was a problem.” It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.”- Truth! This one is also from Dreams from My Father. It is from a section when Obama was a college student and wrestling with his identity including as an African-American.  The quote describes his observation of what was required among his fellow students. “I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn’t speak to my own. It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, Dubois and Mandela.”- Truth! This is from Dreams from my Father .  The more complete quote is, “”Yes, I’d seen weakness in other men— Gramps and his disappointments, Lolo and his compromise. But these men had become object lessons for me, men I might love but never emulate, white men and brown men whose fates didn’t speak to my own. It was into my father’s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I’d packed all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.” “ I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.”- Fiction!

"," Senator Barack Obama was member of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ from 1998 to 2008. As a result of Obama’s candidacy for president, Trinity United Church came under scrutiny.  Critics accused the church of being racist.  Supporters said the congregation was proudly black and with a strong linkage and commitment to its African roots.  That’s a matter of heritage, they said, not a lack of commitment to being Americans. The “About Us” page located at the church’s website said the church is “Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian… Our roots in the Black religious experience and tradition are deep, lasting and permanent. We are an African people, and remain ‘true to our native land,’ the mother continent, the cradle of civilization.” It also said that it is a “congregation with a non-negotiable commitment to Africa.” (Note: In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page.) Because of its black emphasis, the church was overwhelmingly black but there was no requirement to be African-American for membership. In March, 2008, the church’s recently retired pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Jr., became a campaign issue for Senator Obama.  Controversial sermons by Wright began appearing on the Internet.  That prompted news organizations to start reviewing some of Wrights sermons of recent years and several of his statements were branded as anti-American and racist. In a 2003 sermon Wright told his congregation to damn America in God’s name and said the United States was responsible for the Attack on America on 9/11 by dropping nuclear weapons on Japan in World War II and for supporting Israel since 1947. In January, 2006, Wright termed America as the “Number one killer in the world” and blamed the U.S. for the appearance of the AIDS virus.  In an earlier sermon shortly after 9/11 he said “The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.  The government lied.” There was also criticism of Wright for praising racist and anti-Semitic Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan and giving him a humanitarian award. In the midst of the furor over Wright’s sermons, Obama issued a statement that was given to the Christian Broadcasting Network.  Obama said “Let me say at the outset that I vehemently disagree and strongly condemn the statements that have been the subject of this controversy.  I categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies. I also believe that words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it’s on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.”  Obama also said that he had never personally heard any of the controversial statements by Wright. Obama said that he first became aware of some of Wright’s controversial statements at the beginning of his presidential campaign.  He said, ‘I made it clear at the time that I strongly condemned his comments,” Obama said. “But because Rev. Wright was on the verge of retirement, and because of my strong links to the Trinity faith community, where I married my wife and where my daughters were baptized, I did not think it appropriate to leave the church.” Wright stepped down as pastor of Trinity United Church in February, 2008. Obama resigned from the church in 2008. CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama Updated 11/05/08 ","Obama"

"Costly Presidential Trip To India-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-india-2010-trip/"," This is a forwarded email that says that President Obama is traveling to India on November 6, 2010 and that 570 rooms have been booked at the 5 star Taj Mahal Hotel for his entourage.  The email also alleges that this is a sight seeing trip, a large amount of aircraft and vehicles will be accompanying the President to transport the entourage, 34 warships will be on hand to protect the President, the trip will cost the American taxpayers $200 million a day and that the President and the First Lady will bring their daughters. "," It is true that President Obama is travelling to India and that this will be his biggest trip since he began his term in the Oval Office. On October 31, 2010 article United Kingdom’s Daily Mail said that the entire five star Taj Mahal Hotel has been reserved for “two days of his visit and the property will be a no-go area for non-hotel staff while he is staying.”   Full details of security measures have not been released but the Daily Mail article did say that the U.S. Secret service will “set up two command posts in Delhi and Mumbai which will act as the communication nerve centres.”   As an added security measure, the British paper also said that thirty sniffer dogs will be utilized during the Presidential visit. The trip to India is only the first leg of the President’s ten day trip that will cover India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.  An October 27, 2010 White House press conference confirmed that the President would be accompanied by the First Lady, Michelle Obama. The White House held a press conference on November 4, 2010 to correct what it said were inaccurate reports from international press articles about the upcoming trip that sparked a fury of allegations and viral eRumors on the World Wide Web.   The transcript of the press conference can be found on in a November 4, 2010 article by Fox News. Here is what we have been able to find out: The India visit is not an official state visit but more of a sight seeing trip – Fiction! The White House said that this is not a sight seeing visit as the eRumor alleges but the purpose for this trip is to build important links between the US and India, which is on the fast track towards economic growth. The President will be attending a business summit that was organized by the U.S.-India Business Council.  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the President will also be taking part in a commemoration ceremony on the 1 year anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attack. In a briefing , Gibbs said that the President would “take the time to pay his respects to the victims who lost their lives and to sign the guest book there, but also to make some brief remarks.” 40 planes, 3 Helicopters and 6 armored vehicles used to transport entourage – Unproven! TheDaily Mail article did say that 40 planes, including Air Force One, would transport the President and his entourage to India.  The paper said that three Presidential Marine One helicopters and six heavily armored cars, including the President’s fortified “Obama Mobile” Cadillac, fully equipped with nuclear launch codes and communications center, will be on hand to transport the president and members of his party when they arrive in India.   We have not found any official  White House disclosure of logistics for this trip. An entourage of 3,000 travelling with the President to India- Disputed! The Press Trust of India news service said that  “3,000 people including Secret Service agents, US government officials and journalists would accompany the President.”  White House spokesperson Tommy Vietor said, “The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.” Owing to security details Vietor could not go into details but said the numbers were “widely inflated.” A flotilla of 34 warships to protect the President- Fiction! On November 4, 2010 New Delhi Television (NDTV) reported that Obama will be “protected by a fleet of 34 warships, including an aircraft carrier, which will patrol the sea lanes off the Mumbai coast during his two-day stay there beginning Saturday. The measure has been taken as Mumbai attack in 2008 took place from the sea.”  Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters at the White House Press Conference, “I will take the liberty this time of dismissing as absolutely absurd this notion that somehow we are deploying ten percent of the Navy, some 34 ships, and an aircraft carrier in support of the president’s trip to Asia — that’s just comical. Nothing close to that is being done.” This trip will cost the American Tax payers $200 Million a day- Unproven! Similar versions of this eRumor have also been circulating focusing on the current economic conditions in the U.S. and financial cost saying that this trip could cost the American taxpayer $200 Million a day.  According to a November 4, 2010 CBS repor t, those numbers were reported by the Press Trust of India without a substantial source.   CBS News asked the White House to verify this amount  and an email response said, “The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality.” The President will be accompanied by children, Sasha and Malia- Fiction! Some false reports from international news agencies originally said that the President will be accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and two daughters, Malia and Sasha.    On October 29, 2010, a Press Trust of India article said that daughters Sasha and Malia will not be travelling to India owing to commitments with school. updated 11/4/10 ","Obama"

"," There is no new policy by the Obama Administration forbidding U.S. Servicemen from appearing at faith-based fund raising events. We have found Department of Defense (DOD) ethics polices dating back as far as 1997 that prohibited DOD employees from officially endorsing or appearing to endorse membership drives or fundraising activities for non-federal entities. Dr. Marty Brunson, the executive director of the Catch-A Dream Foundation, told TruthorFiction.com that Sergeant First Class Greg Stube was a scheduled guest speaker for the 8th Annual Catch the Vision  event hosted on May 16, 2009 by the Starkville Gun Club, about 120 miles North East of Jackson, Mississippi. Stube’s permission to speak was revoked by his commanding officer although this was not because of any new policy of the Obama administration, as the email implied. Sergeant Stube is with U.S. Army Special Forces and was seriously injured in 2006 while serving in Afghanistan.  An improvised explosive device (IED) set off by the Taliban detonated and sent a one-pound piece of shrapnel through his hip and his intestines.   He also lost part of his leg from the fire blast of the explosion but miraculously survived the ordeal. The Catch-A Dream Foundation is a non profit organization that provides outdoor experiences to children with life-threatening illness. The originator of the email was not an employee at Catch-A-Dream but a volunteer who sent out his complaint to a few friends and it eventually avalanched on World Wide Web.

Corsi has built a reputation for writing about conspiracy theories and sparking controversies about politicians. The President’s gold ring was designed and made in Indonesia according to an October 26, 2009 article in the New York Times. Regardless of what is inscribed on his ring, President Obama has on a number of occasions stated that he is a Christian.  When he visited Cairo in 2009 he said, “Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I am a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and the fall of dusk.

"," The picture is authentic.  It was published in Time magazine and was taken 9/16/07 at an event in Indianola, Iowa where six Democratic presidential candidates appeared.  It was Iowa Senator Tom Harkin’s annual “meat and greet.”   The fourth person in the picture is Senator Harkin’s wife, Ruth.  Not seen in the picture are three other candidates who were standing out of view on the right side of the platform, Senator Chris Dodd, Senator John Edwards, Senator Joe Biden. At question is what was going on with Senator Obama?   His critics are circulating the picture and saying that he is not respecting the flag or the National Anthem, especially since the protocol, according to the United States Flag code, is that civilians should have their right hands over their hearts and that they should be facing the flag.  His supporters are saying that this little lapse should not be held against him since there have been plenty of other events at which he has saluted the flag—so it did not mean that he would, in principle, avoid doing it. Some supporters have suggested that perhaps the picture does not tell the whole story and that he may have raised his hand shortly after it was taken. An ABC News video, however, shows that Senator Obama did not salute at any time during the Anthem and that everybody else on the platform did. A spokesperson for the Senator told Fox News that it was ridiculous to suggest that Obama was making any kind of a statement and that sometimes “he does and sometimes he doesn’t place his hand over his heart during the National Anthem.” In 2008, a hoax started circulating that claimed to quote Obama about why he didn’t salute the flag during the National Anthem and why he did not wear a lapel pin.

"," According to federal records the Social Security number in question does not belong to Jean Paul Ludwig. TruthOrFiction.Com has contacted Ms. Wayne and she told us that she was not the author this eRumor. The Social Security Death Index Interactive Search for Jean Paul Ludwig shows a different number than what is mentioned in the eRumor and that he died in 1981.

This document contains the same Social Security number mentioned in the eRumor and we believe it to be the source of the number in the eRumor. Taitz also posted a response from the Social Security Administration on her website that says that the number in question did not match the number in their records belonging to Barack Obama.  The report also said that the number matches one issued to an unnamed deceased person. A spokesperson from the Selective Service System confirmed for TruthorFiction.com that the Social Security number and the draft registration number on the document did indeed belong to Barack Obama and they have no other Social Security numbers associated with his name.

She said that Obama’s visit was an official one as a senator, along with    two other senators, not as a political candidate who would be doing some    of the things that a celebrity might have done such as holding a public    event. According to Nielson,    Obama’s visit was not announced to the troops for security reasons but    that Obama did speak to many of the soldiers who were on hand as he    arrived for a briefing and posed for photographs.  In fact, she said,    he was delayed in getting inside the building where a briefing was to take    place because of his spending time with the soldiers. Likewise, said Nielsen. Obama did not shun any soldiers at the clamshell    because he never went there.  There was no basketball in Afghanistan    for Obama and no publicity pictures.  He did play basketball with    soldiers during a visit to Kuwait.

The missionary is Celeste Davis who, along with her husband, Loren, operate Loren Davis Ministries in Kenya. We contacted Celeste Davis and asked for documentation of any of her assertions.  Her reply was that the contents of her email were “common knowledge in Kenya.” We’ll take topics in the email one-by-one, however: Obama’s cousin, Raila Odinga, is a Socialist who is trying to bring down the government in Kenya, Africa- Truth! & Unproven! Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya.  He served in various governmental positions including Prime Minister and was an opposition candidate for president in an election in Kenya in 2007.  He didn’t win but claimed that the vote was rigged and the uproar and violence that resulted took hundreds of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Part of the controversy surrounding Odinga is his ties with Islamic interests.  He campaigned for Islamic votes and it was rumored that he had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Moslem leaders.  The content of the memo was not immediately released and stories circulated that Odinga had promised that if he was elected, Islam would be the only religion of Kenya and strict Islamic sharia law would become the law of the land.  In November, 2007, Odinga and the National Muslim Leaders Forum, with whom the MoU had been signed, jointly said that there had neither been an agreement for Islam to be the only religion in Kenya nor a pact to implement sharia law.  The Moslem leaders said they simply wanted assurance to “safeguard the interests and welfare of a section of the Kenyan community (Muslims) that has undergone atrocities over the last 44 years.” Non-Moslem religious leaders, however, claimed to have copies of a signed MoU that would have declared sharia law as the “only true law sanctioned by the Holy Quran for Muslim declared regions” and “popularize Islam as the only true religion.” Odinga claimed to be Obama’s cousin. He said that Barack Obama’s father was his uncle. A Reuters article from 1/8/08, however quotes Barack Obama’s uncle, who is not named, as saying that Obama and Odinga are not blood relatives. He said, “Odinga’s mother came from this area so it is normal for us to talk about cousins” but that the two were not directly related. World Net Daily has published photocopies of what it says is the agreement signed between Odinga and Moslem leaders. Click for Agreement Obama and Raila talk with each other daily- Unproven! There is no way of knowing how often they talk, but they have met, both in the U.S. and in Africa and have had telephone conversations.  In a 2006, Odinga hosted Obama for a visit to Kenya and Obama appeared with him and praised Odinga at rallies in Nairobi.  At the beginning of the U.S. presidential primary season in 2007, Obama called Odinga, according to the London Telegraph.  Odinga said they discussed the “destabilizing constitutional crisis” in Kenya.  The Associated Press quoted Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs as confirming the conversation, which, he said, lasted for about 5-minutes.  The London Telegraph said it was understood that Obama also tried to call Odinga’s opponent, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki. Obama has given almost a million dollars to his cousin’s opposition campaign-Reported to be Truth! This is based on a document that has circulated in blogs and on message boards on the Internet and that is represented to be an internal memo of Odinga’s party’s “CAMPAIGN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES.”  It includes a list of donations, one of which is from “Friends of Senator BO.”  The donation is for 66 million Kenya shillings, more than 1 million U.S. dollars.  The conservative website WorldNetDaily said in October, 2008, that it had confirmed that the donation was organized by Obama.  In a report published on 10/15/08, WorldNetDaily said sources in Kenya said the money came from a series of private meetings arranged for Odinga by Mark Lippert, a foreign policy advisor in Obama’s U.S. Senate office.  The meetings are said to have taken place during and Odinga trip 2006 trip to the United States.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also reported on September 30, 2008 the formation of the Obama Truth Squad and this was a topic of conversation on the Rush Limbaugh radio show as wells as programs on the Fox News Channel. According to the Post-Dispatch, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer have joined forces to form the “Obama truth squad.” Joyce and McCulloch stated, “The truth squad’s plan is to identify false attacks and respond immediately with truthful information.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch article also stated that these people were all Democrats. It is not uncommon for a campaign to use spokespersons to debunk false claims against the candidate. Senator McCain has used the services of supporters, mostly military and former prisoners of war, although South Carolina House Speaker Bobby Harrell and Henry McMaster, the Attorney General for that state, are listed in his own truth squad to assist in setting the record straight. Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, issued a statement that accused Obama of “police state tactics” which would “intimidate people and kill free debate.” In a telephone interview with Fox News he voiced his concerns about prosecutors and sheriffs responding to false claims against Obama and taking aggressive action. In his statement, Governor Blunt told Obama, “Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts – not a free society.” When asked about intimidating effect on voters, a deputy communications director for the Obama campaign told Fox news that Blunt was mischaracterizing this. According to a news article posted by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis – St. Paul, Minnesota on August 22, 2008, Bill Ayers was part of a group that claimed responsibility for bombings at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s.   Ayers surrendered to authorities in 1980 and owing to misconduct claims against the prosecution his charges were dropped.   Obama stated that he “deplored” Ayers’ actions in the 1960s and that “by the time I met him, he is a professor of education at the University of Illinois.” Critics of the Obama-Ayers relationship said that Obama has had close association with, and the support of, a militant who has never really repented of Pentagon and U.S. Capitol bombings and has actually been quoted in the New York Times on September 11, 2001 as saying that ”I don’t regret setting bombs,” and  ”I feel we didn’t do enough.” Ayers went on to become one of Obama’s most important supporters and the first fund-raiser for Obama’s campaign for the Illinois senate was set up by Ayers. Obama objects to the criticism saying that his association with Ayers was long after his young militant days.  Ayers and Obama served together for the non profit education reform organization, Chicago Annenberg Challenge.

This was not the first time security protocols owing to a Presidential visit may have inconvenienced others.   In 1993 two runways at Los Angeles International Airport were shut down so that President Bill Clinton could get a haircut from a Beverly Hills barber on Air Force One.   Air traffic at LAX was ordered to stand by or circle until Air Force One departed.   The delay, according to a May 21, 1993 New York Times article lasted about an hour. posted 02/07/13 ","Obama"
"Barack Obama Was Wrong When he Claimed That His Uncle Helped Liberate Auschwitz-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-auschwitz/"," The forwarded email quotes senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama as saying that his uncle was a part of the Army troops that liberated the Auschwitz death camp in Poland.  The writer of the eRumor said that’s a lie, that the Russians liberated Auschwitz, not the Americans. "," The senator got this one    wrong. At a campaign appearance in New Mexico in May, 2008, Obama made the    statement quoted in the eRumor.  He proudly talked of an uncle who    helped liberate Auschwitz.  The problem is that Auschwitz was    liberated on January 27, 1945 by Stalin’s Red Army.  No American    troops were involved. The Obama campaign quickly explained that Obama wasn’t lying and the story was true, but that it    was Obama’s great-uncle he was talking about and he was involved with American troops in    liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.  Later a    spokesperson further corrected that the great-uncle served in the 89th    Infantry Division that liberated the Ohrdruf concentration camp, which was    a subcamp of Buchenwald.

"Obama Lies?-Truth!, Fiction!, and Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-lies/"," A lengthy email represented as lies told by Senator Barack Obama. "," This is a list of alleged “lies” by presidential candidate Barack Obama that circulated during the 2008 presidential primary season. There were several different versions, the first having only about 25 criticisms of Obama and instead of calling him a “liar” it ended each claim with the phrase “Not quite.”  Then it was 46 questions and a version circulated that added four more to make it 50 lies. It was a very difficult and tedious process to research this.   Whoever put it together did not document where Obama made these statements and many of them could not be found. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. ( CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama ) Let’s deal with them one at a time. LIE # 1.) Selma Got Me Born – LIAR, your parents felt safe enough to have you in 1961 – Selma had no effect on your birth, as Selma was in 1965. (Google ‘Obama Selma’ for his full March 4, 2007 speech and articles about its various untruths.)- Truth! This refers to a speech Obama gave and when he did get the dates of his birth and the events at Selma backwards. It was in 2007 at a celebration of the famous Selma-to- Montgomery Voting Rights March in Alabama that took place in March, 1965. At one point in the speech, Obama described how that was the environment in which his father came to the United States and met his mother.  Then he said, “There was something stirring across the country because of what happened in Selma, Alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge. So they got together and Barack Obama Jr. was born. So don’t tell me I don’t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don’t tell me I’m not coming home to Selma, Alabama.” The Selma Voting Rights March was in March, 1965.  Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 so he was not born in the shadow of what happened in Selma. 2.) Father Was A Goat Herder – LIAR, he was a privileged, well educated youth, who went on to work with the Kenyan Government- Truth! & Fiction! It is true that Obama’s father became well-educated and had the advantage in his early life of having learned to read and write. It is also true, however, that he herded goats.  In his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, Obama describes that his father herded goats for his own father, who was a farmer.  As a youth, Obama’s father was sent to a missionary school to be educated.  When he returned, according to family members, he could find little work except goat herding in his village of Nyangoma Kogela in Western Kenya. 3.) Father Was A Proud Freedom Fighter – LIAR, he was part of one of the most corrupt and violent governments Kenya has ever had- Unproven! We could not find this claim that Obama represented his father as a “proud freedom fighter.” 4.) My Family Has Strong Ties To African Freedom – LIAR, your cousin Raila Odinga has created mass violence in attempting to overturn a legitimate election in 2007, in Kenya .. It is the first widespread violence in decades- Unproven! & Truth! Again, we could not find where Obama said that his family has strong ties to African Freedom. Raila Odinga is a well-known politician in Kenya who ran for president in 2007 and challenged the election results when he lost.  The resulting violence killed hundreds and left thousands homeless.  Odinga has claimed to be Obama’s cousin but Obama has never acknowledged that and no proof of the connection has been offered. 5.) My Grandmother Has Always Been A Christian – LIAR, she does her daily Salat prayers at 5am according to her own interviews. Not to mention, Christianity wouldn’t allow her to have been one of 14 wives to 1 man- Fiction! We could not find a time when Obama claimed that his grandmother had always been a Christian. If he did, the writer of this email described a Moslem woman, which would be Obama’s grandmother on his father’s side.  In a speech in 2007, Obama described his maternal grandparents as “nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists.” 6.) My Name is African Swahili – LIAR, your name is Arabic and ‘Baraka’ (from which Barack came) means ‘blessed’ in that language. Hussein is also Arabic and so is Obama- Fiction! & Truth! There has been a lot of discussion about this one with some people connecting the name to Arabic words, others to Hebrew, and others to Swahili.  Regardless, the name “Barack” or “Barak” is found among Africans and “Barak” is a Swahili word meaning blessing or prosperity.  There are also related Arabic words such as “baaraka,” which relates to blessing and most agree that the name is derived from Arabic.  Obama has cited both origins of the name.  In his book Dreams From My Father , Obama describes the name in this way:  ““It means ‘Blessed.’ In Arabic. My grandfather was a Muslim.”  He has also described his first name as Swahili. Barack Hussein Obama is not half black. If elected, he would be the first Arab-American President, not the first black President. Barack Hussein Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother’s side and 43.75% Arabic and 6.25% African Negro from his father’s side. While Barack Hussein Obama’s father was from Kenya , his father’s family was mainly Arabs. Barack Hussein Obama’s father was only 12.5% African Negro and 87.5% Arab (his father’s birth certificate even states he’s Arab, not African Negro). From….and for more….go to….. http://www.arcadeathome.com/newsboy.phtml?Barack_Hussein_Obama_-_Arab-American,_only_6.25%25_African- Fiction! There is no evidence that any of this is true.  The link provided for documentation is from a user forum on a game site, hardly a reliable source. Obama’s father’s family is overwhelmingly African.  According to an overview of published genealogies of Barack Obama:  His father was Barack Obama.  His grandfather was Onyango Obama, a Kenyen who converted to Islam.  His great grandfather was simply known as Obama of Kendu Bay, Kenya.  His second great grandfather was named Obiyo.  His third great grandfather was named Okoth.  His fourth great grandfather was named Obongo.  His fifth great grandfather was named Otondi.  His sixth great grandfather was named Ogelo.  His seventh great grandfather was named Ogelo. 7.) I Never Practiced Islam – LIAR, you practiced it daily at school, where you were registered as a Muslim and kept that faith for 31 years, until your wife made you change, so you could run for office- Mostly Fiction! As a child, Obama attended both Islamic and Christian schools.  In the Islamic school there was education about Islam faith and practice as there was in the Christian school.  There is no evidence that as an adult Obama has ever practiced Islam. We have dealt with this in detail in a story about Obama’s faith. CLICK HERE for that story. 8.) My School In Indonesia Was Christian – LIAR, you were registered as Muslim there and got in trouble in Koranic Studies for making faces (check your own book)- Truth! & Fiction! In his book Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of attending both the Islamic and the Christian schools in Indonesia during his childhood. He does describe that one of the teachers from the Islamic school “wrote to tell my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies.” The Associated Press reported on 1/24/08 that when his family moved to Indonesia when he was a child, “At first, Obama attended the Catholic school, Fransiskus Assisis, where documents showed he enrolled as a Muslim, the religion of his stepfather. The document required that each student choose one of five state-sanctioned religions when registering – Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Catholic or Protestant.” 9.) I Was Fluent In Indonesian – LIAR, not one teacher says you could speak the language- Fiction! We’ve not found any record of Obama claiming to be fluent in any Indonesian language.  He is said to speak a little Bahasa, the national language of Indonesia. 10.) Because I Lived In Indonesia , I Have More Foreign Experience – LIAR, you were there from the ages of 6 to 10, and couldn’t even speak the language. What did you learn, how to study the Koran and watch cartoons- Fiction! Again, we have not found any occasion when Obama claimed that his childhood in Indonesia qualified him as having “more foreign experience.” 11.) I Am Stronger On Foreign Affairs – LIAR, except for Africa (surprise) and the Middle East (bigger surprise), you have never been anywhere else on the planet and thus have NO experience with our closest allies- Opinion! & Fiction! As a presidential candidate, Obama certainly argues that he is qualified to deal with foreign policy, but whether that is true or not depends on the observer and is a matter of opinion.  His travels have included more than Africa and the Middle East, however.  He was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and served on several subcommittees.   He was described by his critics as the most traveled freshman Senator.  His travels have included Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan in Asia, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, the Palestinian Territories, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa. 12.) I Blame My Early Drug Use On Ethnic Confusion – LIAR, you were quite content in high school to be Barry Obama, no mention of Kenya and no mention of struggle to identify – your classmates said you were just fine- Partly Truth! Obama’s autobiography deals extensively with his experience growing up as an African-American and the issues that presented him.  His drug use, he says, was “…something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind, something that could flatten out the landscape of my heart, blur the edges of my memory.”  In October, 2006, he told a New York Times reporter that his drug use was “…reflective of the struggles and confusion of a teenage boy.  Teenage boys are frequently confused.” 13.)An Ebony Article Moved Me To Run For Office – LIAR, Ebony has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Fiction! We have not found any reference in either of his books of an Ebony article that influenced Obama’s decision to run for office. 14.) A Life Magazine Article Changed My Outlook On Life – LIAR, Life has yet to find the article you mention in your book. It doesn’t, and never did, exist- Truth! & Fiction! In Dreams From My Father, Obama tells of seeing a picture in Life Magazine of a black man who tried to peel off his skin.  It happened at a time when he was being told by his mother about bigotry and when he was looking at himself in the mirror and wondering if there was something wrong with him.  “I imagine other black children, then and now, undergoing similar moments of revelation,” he wrote. “I know that seeing that article was violent for me, an ambush attack.” We have not found documentation that “Life has yet to find the article.” 15.) I Won’t Run On A National Ticket In ’08 – LIAR, here you are, despite saying, live on TV, that you would not have enough experience by then, and you are all about having experience first- Truth! After his Senate victory in 2004 he ruled out a national run owing to his lack of experience. Click for the YouTube video 16.) Present Votes Are Common In Illinois – LIAR, they are common for YOU, but not many others have 130 NO VOTES- Mostly Truth! This is with reference to criticism of Obama for having voted “present” 130 times during his service in the Illinois legislature instead of “yes” or “no.”   The “present” vote is, in fact, common in the Illinois state legislature and is sometimes at the request of the legislative leaders.  When legislators vote, they use buttons on their desks that register their choices electronically.  A red button is for “no,” a green button is for “yes,” and a yellow button is for “present.” 17.) Oops, I Misvoted – LIAR, only when caught by church groups and democrats, did you beg to change your misvote. We’re not sure what this was regarding. 18.) I Was A Professor Of Law – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Fiction! The University of Chicago Law School has issued a statement on this: “From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status. Like Obama, each of the Law School’s Senior Lecturers has high-demand careers in politics or public service, which prevent full-time teaching. Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School, Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full-time tenure-track position, but he declined.” 19.) I Was A Constitutional Lawyer – LIAR, you were a senior lecturer ON LEAVE- Unclear! We didn’t find this as a claim of Obama’s but if he did, he may have been referring to his time as a Civil Rights lawyer in Chicago. 20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill – LIAR, you didn’t write it, introduce it, change it, or create it- Fiction! It depends on what the writer of this email was referring to.  We haven’t found a quote that said “Without me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill.”  As an Illinois State Senator, Obama did help pass a major ethics reform bill.  The 110th U.S. Congress passed the Legislative Transparency and Accountability act, which drew from provisions in a bill that Senators Obama and Feingold had originally introduced. 21.) The Ethics Bill Was Hard To Pass – LIAR, it took just 14 days from start to finish – Unproven! We could not find when he said this. 22.) I Wrote A Tough Nuclear Bill – LIAR, your bill was rejected by your own party for its pandering and lack of all regulation – mainly because of your Nuclear Donor, Exelon, from which David Axelrod came- Truth! Obama has talked of nuclear legislation he pushed in the Illinois legislature.  At a presidential campaign appearance in Iowa in December, 2007, the New York Times quoted him as having said it was “the only nuclear legislation that I’ve passed.”  In reality, the bill never did pass.  It died in the Illinois Senate. According to the New York Times, at issue was the concern of citizens about unreported low-level radioactive leaks at nuclear plants.  On the other side was Exelon, the largest nuclear plant operator in the nation and one of the largest campaign contributors to Obama. 23.) I Have Released My State Records – LIAR, as of March, 2008, state bills you sponsored or voted for have yet to be released, exposing all the special interests pork hidden within- Fiction! We haven’t found the quote “I have released my state records.”  On November 14, 2007, an Associated Press article quoted Obama as saying, “I don’t have — I don’t maintain — a file of eight years of work in the state Senate because I didn’t have the resources available to maintain those kinds of records.”  Records of state bills and the votes of senators, however, are available from the Illinois state legislature. 24.) I Took On The Asbestos Altgeld Gardens Mess – LIAR, you were part of a large group of people who remedied Altgeld Gardens . You failed to mention anyone else but yourself, in your books- Truth! & Fiction! In his book, Obama goes into detail about his work as a community organizer and the role that he played in the troubled Altgeld Gardens housing project in Chicago.  It was home for 5,300 African Americans who lived with concerns that they felt the city had not been responsive to.  Among them were a nearby landfill and a sewage treatment plant.  One of the goals was to get the city to remove asbestos from the apartments.  Obama does focus on his role as the organizer. 25.) My Economics Bill Will Help America – LIAR, your 111 economic policies were just combined into a proposal which lost 99-0, and even YOU voted against your own bill. We’re not sure what this is referring to or what bill included 111 Obama economic policies.  Also, we have not been able to find this exact quote from Obama. 26.) I Have Been A Bold Leader In Illinois – LIAR, even your own supporters claim to have not seen BOLD action on your part. We have not found this exact quote from Obama and the conclusion calls for opinion. 27.) I Passed 26 Of My Own Bills In One Year – LIAR, they were not YOUR bills, but rather handed to you, after their creation by a fellow Senator, to assist you in a future bid for higher office- Truth! We haven’t found the quote “I passed 26 of my own bills in one year.”  It is true that he passed 26 bills in his final year as a state senator. It is also true that he was handed those bills by senate majority leader Emil Jones, Jr., a veteran Democrat who was black, who represented Chicago’s south side, and is credited with having thrust Obama into prominence. 28.) No One Contacted Canada About NAFTA – LIAR, the Canadian Government issued the names and a memo of the conversation your campaign had with them- Disputed! This arises from an issue in the primary campaign that became known as “NAFTA-Gate” and included a volley of charges between the campaigns of Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Obama. During a debate in Cleveland, Ohio in February, 2008, Obama said that he would renegotiate the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico or else opt out of it.  The next day after the debate, the Canadian Television Network (CTV) ran a story that said that an Obama staff member called Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. to alert him about what Obama was going to say and to not take it seriously. The Obama campaign and the Canadian embassy both issued statements denying that any such phone call had taken place. Then CTV reported that the conversation about NAFTA may have taken place in a Chicago meeting with Canadian officials that included Austan Goolsbee, the senior economic adviser to the Obama campaign and an economics professor at the University of Chicago. On 3/3/08 The Associated Press reported on a memo that it said had been “widely distributed” in the Canadian government that described the meeting as having taken place in February.  The memo said that Goolsbee “was frank in saying that the primary campaign has been necessarily domestically focused, particularly in the Midwest, and that much of the rhetoric that may be perceived to be protectionist is more reflective of political maneuvering than policy. On NAFTA, Goolsbee suggested, according to the report, that Obama is less about fundamentally changing the agreement and more in favor of strengthening/clarifying language on labor mobility and environment and trying to establish these as more `core’ principles of the agreement.”  In the same Associated Press article Goolsbee said the memo “misquoted” him.  In a later AP article Goolsbee said,  “In no possible way was I inferring that he [Obama] was going to introduce any policies that you should ignore and he had no intention of enacting.” On March 3 the Canadian embassy in Washington said it “deeply regrets” the affair, and that “there was no intention to convey, in any way” that Obama was being inconsistent about NAFTA: 29.) I Am Tough On Terrorism – LIAR, you missed the Iran Resolution vote on terrorism and your good friend Ali Abunimah supports the destruction of Israel- Truth! In September, 2007, there was a vote in the U.S. Senate on an amendment that designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.  It was sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl (Republican, Arizona) and Joe Lieberman (independent, Connecticut).  Obama was on the campaign trail and was not present for the vote.  Hillary Clinton was and voted in favor of it.  In November, 2007, Obama introduced a Senate resolution that said that President Bush did not have authority to use military force against Iran. 30.) I Am Not Acting As President Yet – LIAR, after the NAFTA Memo, a dead terrorist in the FARC, in Colombia, was found with a letter stating how you and he were working together on getting FARC recognized officially- Partly Truth! & Unproven! We have not found the “I Am Not Acting As President Yet” quote. This is referring to the 3/1/08 death of FARC warlord Raul Reyes after a strike by the Colombian army.  His laptop computer was seized and among the documents from the computer that were released by the Colombian government was a 2/28/08 letter from Reyes to his inner circle.  The letter said, “two gringos” assured him that “the new president of their country will be Obama and that they are interested in your compatriots. Obama will not support ‘Plan Colombia’ nor will he sign the TLC (Free Trade Agreement).” It has not been revealed who Reyes had spoken with or whether they had the authority to speak for Obama. 31.) I Didn’t Run Ads In Florida – LIAR, you allowed national ads to run 8-12 times per day for two weeks – and you still lost- Truth! & Disputed! In 2006 the Democratic National Committee (DNC) decided that only four states would be allowed to hold primaries or caucuses before February 5, 2008: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.  The Florida legislature, however, moved both the Republican and Democratic primaries to a week earlier, January 29.  The DNC voted that Florida was in violation of its rules.  The four states that were allowed the early primaries asked presidential candidates to pledge not to campaign in Florida and both Clinton and Obama agreed not to even though both of their names were still on the Florida ballot. In January, 2008, the Clinton campaign accused Obama of violating the promise to avoid campaigning in Florida because of television ads that were running on both CNN and MSNBC. The Obama campaign replied that they were not violating the pledge because they were not targeting Florida.  They were airing national advertisements that they had asked be blacked out in Florida but that the networks had said could not be done.  Obama’s campaign also said that at that time the only one of the four approved states that had not yet held it primary was South Carolina.  The Obama campaign said that it had consulted with Carol Fowler the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party who said that she did not regard the national ads to be a violation of the pledge to the early states. 32.) I Won Michigan – LIAR, no you didn’t- Truth! & Accident! Obama never seriously claimed to have won in Michigan, where his name wasn’t even on the ballot.  During a March 8, 2008 interview on the Today show, he did accidentally include Michigan in a short list of states in which he had won.  Supporters said it was a gaffe from a tired candidate. 33.) I won Nevada – LIAR, no you did not- Fiction! The delegate count from Nevada was a matter of calculation and was a bit complicated.  As a result, both Clinton and Obama made early claims to have won the majority of the delegates.  In the end, Obama did end up with 13 delegates to Clinton’s 12. 34.) I Want All Votes To Count – LIAR, you said let the delegates decide – Unproven! We have not found that Obama advocated letting all delegates decide a candidate for president.  The uncommitted Democratic delegates can make their own decision whom to support.  In Florida, though, if the Democrats were to allow the primary vote to count, each candidate would receive delegates based on what percentage of the votes were cast for him or her. 35.) I Want Americans To Decide – LIAR, you prefer caucuses that limit the vote, confuse the voters, force a public vote, and only operate during small windows of time- Opinion! We have not found evidence that Obama prefers caucuses but he had no influence on what each state decides about whether to hold elections or caucuses. 36.) I passed 900 Bills in the State Senate – LIAR, you passed 26, most of which you didn’t write yourself- Fiction! Obama has never claimed passage of 900 bills in the Illinois state senate. 37.) My Campaign Was Extorted By A Friend – LIAR, that friend is threatening to sue if you do not stop saying this. Obama has stopped saying this. Not sure what this is referring to. 38.) I Believe In Fairness, Not Tactics – LIAR, you used tactics to eliminate Alice Palmer from running against you- Mostly Truth! Alice Palmer held the Illinois senate seat that Obama won in his first election in 1995.  During her final year in office she decided to run for the U.S. Congress, but lost.  She then hastily worked on qualifying for the ballot to retain her spot in the senate and some of her supporters even asked Obama to step aside in her favor.  Obama pressed forward, however, and one if his tactics was to challenge hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions for Alice Palmer and three other candidates.  The result was that none of them had enough qualifying signatures and Obama was alone on the ballot.  Obama said he was operating by the rules and that if the candidates couldn’t get enough valid signatures, they might not be effective legislators.  Critics, including some Democrats, criticized Obama for playing hardball in an election in which he had said he wanted to “empower disenfranchised citizens.” 39.) I Don’t Take PAC Money – LIAR, you take loads of it- Fiction! According to FactCheck.org Obama has not received any money from Political Actions Committees (PAC) in the 2007-2008 presidential campaign.  There were some Clinton ads that accused him of taking PAC money but according to FactCheck.org they referred to funds he received during previous campaigns for the Illinois state senate and the U.S. Senate and before he had made the pledge not to take PAC money. 40.) I don’t Have Lobbysists – LIAR, you have over 47 lobbyists, and counting- Partly Truth! According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama had raised more than $115,000 from “lobbyists” as of March 20, 2008.  FactCheck.org quotes Obama’s campaign as saying this money is all from former lobbyists, not ones that are currently active.  “Obama does not accept funds from registered federal lobbyists but does accept money from spouses of lobbyists, non-lobbying partners who work for lobbying firms or for law firms that do lobbying, ex-lobbyists, and state lobbyists,” according to FactCheck.org. 41.) My Campaign Had Nothing To Do With The 1984 Ad – LIAR, your own campaign worker made the ad on his Apple in one afternoo n- Mostly Truth! A campaign controversy erupted in March, 2007 when a video appeared on YouTube that attacked Hillary Clinton.  Hundreds of thousands of viewers saw it on YouTube and as a flap developed about where it came from, the Obama campaign denied that it had anything to do with it.  The creator of the video, Phil de Vellis, finally revealed his identity in an article he wrote for The Huffington Post. It turned out that he was an employee of Blue Stage Digital, an Internet strategy firm being used by the Obama campaign.  In his article, de Vellis said that nobody in his company or in the Obama campaign knew that he had made it.  He did it alone on his Mac computer and uploaded it to YouTube.  He resigned from Blue Stage Digital. 42.) My Campaign Never Took Over MySpace – LIAR, Tom, who started MySpace issued a warning about this advertising to MySpace clients- Complicated! In 2004 a paralegal from California named Joe Anthony set up a MySpace page in tribute to Barack Obama.  It was unofficial and he volunteered his time to build the page.  After Obama started campaigning for president, Anthony’s page became a vehicle for the Obama campaign, largely because of the large following it had built.  The campaign started working with Anthony on the page and eventually even had the password so it could make direct improvements.  When MySpace set up a channel to focus on the presidential candidates, the Obama campaign elected to use Anthony’s page instead of setting up one of its own.  The site became so successful and attracted so many MySpace friends that the Obama campaign felt it should have more control.  That’s when a dispute arose over what the next step should be.  Anthony said he’d hand the page over to the campaign if he could get compensated for it.  He proposed a payment of $39,000.  The campaign wasn’t responsive to that proposal.  MySpace eventually gave control of the page over to the campaign but Anthony was allowed to retain the online network of friends he had assembled for a new unofficial Obama page. 43.) I Inspire People With My Words – LIAR, you inspire people with other people’s words We have not found this quote from Obama, but it is probably referring to a flap that developed during the primary campaign when Obama was accused of having borrowed words from Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick during a speech without attributing them.  In an address in Wisconsin on February 16, 2008, Obama said, ”Don’t tell me words don’t matter. ‘I have a dream’— just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ — just words? ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself’ — just words? Just speeches?”  Patrick, during his 2006 campaign for governor, said of his opponent, “but her dismissive point and I hear it a lot from her staff is that all I have to offer is words, just words. ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident,’ just words? Just words? ‘We have nothing to fear itself.’ Just words? ‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’ Just words? ‘I have a dream’– just words?”  Patrick, who supported Obama’s candidacy, issued a statement that said “Senator Obama and I are longtime friends and allies. We often share ideas about politics, policy and language.” 44.) I Have Passed Bills In The U.S. Senate – LIAR, you have passed A BILL in the U.S. Senate – for Africa, which shows YOUR priorities- Fiction! Again, this is not a direct quote that we can find, but Obama has introduced or cosponsored several bills that have passed in the senate.  The first federal bill passed with Obama as the primary sponsor was the Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act.  He cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act, added three amendments to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which passed in the senate but not the house, cosponsored the Obama, McCaskill bill to provide a safety net for families of wounded military personnel, and several other pieces of legislation. 45.) I Have Always Been Against Iraq – LIAR, you weren’t in office to vote against it AND you have voted to fund it every single time, unlike Kucinich, who seems to be out gutting you Obama. You also seem to be stepping back from your departure date – AGAIN. Obama has consistently opposed the war in Iraq and as a presidential candidate has issued proposals on how he would end the war.  In 2007 he did vote in favor of funding for the war saying that he felt that the troops who are there needed it. 46.)

Your guy is a socialist who voted four times in the state Senate to let little babies die in hospital closets; I think you should find something better to do with your time.” After that she hung up on the telemarketer.

"Barack Obama and William Ayers-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-ayers/"," An eRumor claiming that Senator Barack Obama had a long association with a known domestic terrorist by the name of William Ayers who took part in the bombing of the Pentagon "," Ayers was a founding member of a radical group known at the Weather Underground that carried out bombings of federal buildings including the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s. It was in protest of the Vietnam war. Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohm spent a decade as fugitives from the FBI, which classed the Weather Underground as a “domestic terrorist group.” They resurfaced in 1980 after charges against them were dropped because of misconduct in collecting evidence against them. They both became professors in Chicago where Ayers was an education professor at the time that he became a campaign controversy in 2008. Ayers has been unrepentant about his Weather Underground activities and has been quoted as saying they “didn’t do enough.” The nature of Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers was a subject talked about among his critics during the 2008 presidential campaign, but it became a major issue when Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin brought it to the campaign trail in a speech in California on October 4, 2008. She said, “”Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country.” Supporters of Obama said that contact between the two men was not that significant and pointed to a New York Times story that said their relationship consisted of attending board meetings of two Chicago organizations they were involved with and other than that, there had been no contact between them except bumping into each other on the sidewalk in the neighborhood in which they both lived. Obama’s “Fight the Smears” web site called the accusations about the Obama-Ayers connection “phony, tenuous, and exaggerated at best, if not outright false.” The Obama site accused his critics of trying to link him with terrorism or approving of terrorism. Critics said a special investigations unit composed of Drew Griffin and Kathleen Johnston from CNN looked into the Ayers story and concluded that “the relationship between Obama and Ayers went deeper, ran longer and was more political than Obama — and his surrogates.” The CNN story said    that: A review of      board minutes and records by CNN show Obama, crossed      paths repeatedly with Ayers at board meetings of the      Annenberg Challenge Project in Chicago. For seven      years, Ayers and Obama — among many others —      worked on funding for education projects, including      some projects advocated by Ayers. While working      on the Annenberg project, Obama and Ayers also      served together on a second charitable foundation,      the Woods Fund, and that among the Woods Fund      recipients was the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s Trinity      United Church where Obama had his church membership. Obama praised Ayers’ book on the     subject of juvenile justice in a 1997 Chicago Tribune     review, calling it “a searing and timely account of the     juvenile court system, and the courageous individuals     who rescue hope from despair. On a September 23, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an article written by Stanley Kurtz called “Obama and Ayers Pushed Radicalism On Schools. ”   In it Kurtz claims that Barack Obama’s relationship with William Ayers is more than that of just having served together on the board of the educational non profit organization Chicago Annenberg Challenge (CAC) and that “Barack Obama’s first run for the Illinois State Senate was launched at a 1995 gathering at Mr. Ayers’s home.” According to the article, “in early 1995, Mr. Obama was appointed the first chairman of the board, which handled fiscal matters. Mr. Ayers co-chaired the foundation’s other key body, the ‘Collaborative,’ which shaped education policy.”   Kurtz raised a question in this article as to how “a former community organizer fresh out of law school, could vault to the top of a new foundation?”   Even though the Obama campaign had issued a statement denying Ayres recruitment of Obama, Kurtz observed that  “Mr. Ayers founded CAC and was its guiding spirit. No one would have been appointed the CAC chairman without his approval.” The New York Times published an article by Scott Shane about the Senator’s relationship with Ayers on October 3, 2008 called “Obama and ’60s Bomber: A Look Into Crossed Paths.”   In it, Shane wrote, “Their paths have crossed sporadically since then, at a coffee Mr. Ayers hosted for Mr. Obama’s first run for office, on the schools project and a charitable board, and in casual encounters as Hyde Park neighbors.” Shane talked to Obama Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt,  who told him “they have not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages since Mr. Obama began serving in the United States Senate in January 2005 and last met more than a year ago when they bumped into each other on the street in Hyde Park.” Click for Wall Street Journal Kurtz article Click for New York Time Article Click for Obama’s Fight the Smears statement CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama updated 10/08/08 ","Obama"

The news release claims that Senator Obama’s    father, Barack Obama Senior, and his mother, Anne Dunham, never married    and that the senator has been lying about it for decades. Andy Martin variously describes himself as a “Legendary Chicago    muckraker”, “Legendary Chicago Internet columnist”, “ internationally    recognized expert on the Middle East”, “”talk show host”,”America’s most    respected independent foreign policy and intelligence analyst”,”a leading    corruption fighter in Illinois”, and a candidate for the U.S. Senate from    Illinois. Whether Obama was born out of wedlock does not affect his eligibility for    the presidency but it could bring up a credibility issue if his parents    were not married. Obama has    believed them to have been married and has said so on several occasions. There is no good documentation that we know of that they were married or    divorced. Most notable among Obama’s comments about his parents’ marriage are quotes    from his book, Dreams From My Father. Here are excerpts: Speaking of the appearance of his father in his mother’s life, Obama says,    “At the point where my own memories    begin, my mother had already begun a courtship with the man who would    become her second husband.” Again, speaking of his mother and father, “The girl’s parents, wary at    first, were won over by his charm and intellect; the young couple married,    and she bore them a son, to whom he bequeathed his name.” “…self-knowledge, even if accessible, would have made my mother’s    engagement any easier for him to swallow. In fact, how and when the    marriage occurred remains a bit murky, a bill of particulars that I’ve    never quite had the courage to explore. There’s no record of a real    wedding, a cake, a ring, a giving away of the bride. No families were in    attendance; it’s not even clear that people back in Kansas were fully    informed. Just a small civil ceremony, a justice of the peace. The whole    thing seems so fragile… “ Obama’s mother told him that she and her father were married and also    divorced, “It wasn’t your father’s fault that he left, you know. I    divorced him. When the two of us got married, your grandparents weren’t    happy with the idea. But they said okay…” ( CLICK HERE for a list of other related stories about Barack Obama ) Updated 3/24/08 ","Obama"

What’s being talked about here is an industry group deciding to impose fees on itself to fund a promotional campaign, similar to how the dairy producers have created the ‘Got Milk?’ campaign.” The impending tariff may not be completely out of the woods yet as Lehrich also said, “USDA is going to delay implementation and revisit this action.” Updated 11/10/11 ","Obama"

"," Barack Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in February, 2007.  As with other high profile politicians there are stories and questions that began circulating on the Internet about him. There are several emails circulating that, in different ways, say that Obama is Muslim. In December 2009 a new rumor began circulating with a photo of the President saying that he was preparing to pray with Muslims at the Whitehouse in Washington DC during a Muslim prayer event in September 2009.  The photo was taken several months before in April 2009 while the President was removing his shoes to visit a mosque in Turkey. Whitehouse photo: Obama visits mosque in Turkey Obama’s middle name is Hussein (named after his father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr.), his heritage does include Islam, and his grandfather was Muslim.  But there does not seem to be a time when either he or his parents were practicing Muslims and Obama regards himself as a Christian.  Until his resignation from membership in 2008, he was a member of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ where one Sunday morning in 1988 he said walked down the aisle during an alter call by the pastor, Jeremiah Wright. One of the emails says that Obama used the Koran for his swearing-in ceremony in the Senate and intended to use it for his swearing in as president. He did not use a Koran for his swearing in to the Senate and used a Bible when he was inaugurated as president. Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim, did use the Koran for his swearing in ceremony in 2007. In response to email rumors that have circulated about Obama, his campaign has created a page to respond to the rumors including ones about his faith. CLICK HERE for the “Fight the Smears” page. Falsini Interview Some of the most definitive information about Obama’s faith comes from an interview he did with journalist Cathleen Falsini.  She writes that Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii to a white mother who came from Protestant Midwestern stock but whom Obama describes in his own book as a Christian but “a lonely witness for secular humanism.”  Obama’s father was a black African from the Luo tribe of Kenya.  Obama called him agnostic.  Obama’s grandfather on his father’s side was Muslim.  When he was six years old, Obama’s mother and father divorced and she married an Indonesian man who was a non-practicing Moslem.  They moved to Indonesia where Obama said he attended a Roman Catholic school until he was 10.  An article Scott Turow on Salon.com in 2004, however, said that while in Indonesia, Obama spent 2 years in a Moslem school then 2 more in the Catholic school. In terms of actual beliefs, Obama told Falsini that he has a deep faith “…rooted in the Christian tradition.”  He added, “I believe that there are many paths to the same place, and that is a belief that there is a higher power, a belief that we are connected as a people, that there are values that transcend race or culture, that move us forward, and that there’s an obligation for all of us individually as well as collectively to take responsibility to make those values lived.” He said his mother “…was a deeply spiritual person and would spend a lot of time talking about values and give me books about the world’s religions and talk to me about them.  Her view always was that underlying these religions was a common set of beliefs about how you treat other people and how you aspire to act, not just for yourself but also for the greater good.” He also told Falsini, “Alongside my own deep personal faith, I am a follower, as well, of our civic religion. I am a big believer in the separation of church and state.  I am a big believer in our constitutional structure.” Regarding his conversion experience, Obama said, ”  It wasn’t an epiphany. It was much more of a gradual process for me.  I know there are some people who fall out.  Which is wonderful.  God bless them.  For me, I think it was just a moment to certify or publicly affirm a growing faith in me.”  Critics have said that his Christian faith is a political choice to help his image and conceal Islam in his life.  Supporters point out that his conversion took place before he ran for any public office.  In the Falsini interview he said he reads the Bible, although not as much as he wants to, and that prayer is a part of his daily life but not in the formal sense.  “I think I have an ongoing conversation with God.  Throughout the day I’m constantly asking myself questions about what I’m doing, why I am doing it,” he said.  “The difficult thing about any religion, including Christianity, is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize.  There’s the belief, certainly in some quarters, that if people haven’t embraced Jesus Christ as their personal savior, they’re going to hell,” he told Falsini.  She said Obama did not believe that he or anyone else was going to hell and that he wasn’t sure he was going to heaven either.  “What I believe in is that if I live my life as well as I can, that I will be rewarded.  I don’t presume to have knowledge of what happens after I die.  But I feel very strongly that whether the reward is in the here and now or in the hereafter, aligning myself to my faith and values is a good thing.” Obama’s support of abortion, including the controversial partial-birth abortion procedure, resulted in controversy when he was invited by evangelical pastor Rick Warren to be the keynote speaker at an AIDS conference at Saddleback Church in Southern California in 2006.  Warren, who is opposed to abortion, said his invitation to Obama had nothing to do with abortion and that he wanted to embrace diverse voices in his fight against AIDS.  Abortion opponents argued, however, that someone like Obama whose support of abortion included something so extreme as partial-birth abortion should not be given such a prominent platform and endorsement from pro-lifers. Christianity Today In an interview published in Christianity Today magazine in January, 2008, Obama said regarding his beliefs “I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life. But most importantly, I believe in the example that Jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful.” In the same interview Obama said, “There is one thing that I want to mention that I think is important. Part of what we’ve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e-mails that have been sent out, denying my faith, talking about me being a Muslim, suggesting that I got sworn in the U.S. Senate with a Quran in my hand or that I don’t pledge allegiance to the flag. I think it’s really important for your readers to know that I have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years, and I have never practiced Islam. I am respectful of the religion, but it’s not my own.” Click here for the page on Obama’s site that deals with his faith.

"," We have not found any evidence to substantiate that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Leon Panetta overrode the President’s authority.   All statements indicate that the order was given on the Thursday prior to the mission. CIA Director Panetta’s Account In a May 3rd NBC news interview Panetta told reporter Brian Williams that the President signed the mission order on the previous Thursday, the 28th of April. Dialog from the NBC interview: BRIAN WILLIAMS:  When did the President’s order in this mission become real and go up and become a possibility? LEON PANETTA: Well, as you know as we’ve been- debating this issue for a long time. And we had a number of sessions at the White House going over all of the intelligence and all of the approaches as to how we would conduct these operations. But it wasn’t until Thursday morning that the national security advisor called me and said that the President had made a decision to proceed with this operation. And then later that day I received orders signed by the President of the United States to proceed to conduct this operation under Title 50, which means it was a covert operation. And we would be responsible from the President for seeing that this mission was accomplished. White House photo of President Obama and his staff watching the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden The President’s Account On May 8, 2011 the President appeared on the CBS Sixty Minutes program and told reporter Steve Kroft that he was in the situation room monitoring the mission.  Obama was aware of unfolding events around the compound and getting reports from special forces operations head Bill McRaven and Leon Panetta. Dialog from President Obama’s account of the mission on CBS 60 Minutes program: KROFT: I want to go to the Situation Room. What was the mood? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Tense. KROFT: People talking? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, but doing a lot of listening as well, ’cause we were able to monitor the situation in real time. Getting reports back from Bill McRaven, the head of our special forces operations, as well as Leon Panetta. And you know, there were big chunks of time in which all we were doin’ was just waiting. And it was the longest 40 minutes of my life with the possible exception of when Sasha got meningitis when she was three months old, and I was waiting for the doctor to tell me that she was all right. It was a very tense situation. KROFT: Were you nervous? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What could you see? PRESIDENT OBAMA: As I said, we were monitoring the situation. And we knew as events unfolded what was happening in and around the compound, but we could not get information clearly about what was happening inside the compound. KROFT: Right. And that went on for a long time? Could you hear gunfire? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had a sense of when gunfire and explosions took place. KROFT: Flashes? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. And we also knew when one of the helicopters went down in a way that wasn’t according to plan. And, as you might imagine that made us more tense. KROFT: So it got off to a bad start? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it did not go exactly according to planned, but this is exactly where all the work that had been done anticipating what might go wrong made a huge difference. KROFT: There was a backup plan? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a backup plan. KROFT: You had to blow up some walls? PRESIDENT OBAMA: We had to blow up some walls. KROFT: When was the first indication you got that you had found the right place? That bin Laden was in there? PRESIDENT OBAMA: There was a point before folks had left, before we had gotten everybody back on the helicopter and were flying back to base, where they said Geronimo has been killed. And Geronimo was the code name for bin Laden. And now obviously at that point these guys were operating in the dark with all kinds of stuff going on so everybody was cautious. But at that point cautiously optimistic. KROFT: What was your reaction when you heard those words? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I was relieved and I wanted to make sure those guys got over the Pakistan border and landed safely. And I think deeply proud and deeply satisfied of my team. KROFT: When did you start to feel comfortable that bin Laden had been killed? PRESIDENT OBAMA: When they landed we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him. Photographs had been taken. Facial analysis indicated that in fact it was him. We hadn’t yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure. KROFT: Did you see the pictures? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes. KROFT: What was your reaction when you saw them? PRESIDENT OBAMA: It was him. Also,  there did not appear to be any delay in the President’s decision once intelligence confirmed the location of the Al Qaeda leader.  Rigorous planning took place months prior to the mission which included the President being briefed on every stage of the mission plan as well as back up contingency plans.   Obama said this about the Special Forces team and the planning, “Obviously we have extraordinary guys. Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan.

"Hawaii Was Not a State When Obama was Born There and his Mother Was Not Eligible to Give Birth to a U.S. Citizen-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-birth/"," There are a couple of eRumors about this: One says Obama was born in Hawaii before it became a part of the United States and is, therefore, not a U.S. citizen by birth, which is a requirement for being president. The other says that U.S. law stipulates that if only one parent was a citizen at the time of your birth, that parent must have resided in the United States for at least ten year, at least five of which had to be after the age of 16.  The eRumor says that Obama’s mother was only 18 when he was born, which was only 2 years after the age of 18.  One version claims to be from economist Thomas Sowell. "," All of these claims are intentional hoaxes, including the version that claims to be from Thomas Sowell.  Somebody simply tacked his name onto the eRumor. First, Hawaii became a part of the United States in 1959.  Barack Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961 so his birth was in the United States, not just a U.S. territory.  Obama has posted his birth certificate on his web site. Even if he had been born in Hawaii when it was a U.S. territory, he would still be regarded as a citizen.  According to The Immigration and Nationality Act, Title III, SEC. 305. [8 C. 1405], “A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth.”  Republican candidate John McCain was born in Panama and is considered to be a U.S. citizen under the same act.  McCain was born on a U.S. military base and both of his parents were U.S. citizens. If Obama was born in Hawaii, the issue of the citizenship of his mother is not relevant because he would be a citizen by birth.  But the law cited in the eRumor about having just one parent with U.S. citizenship applied to persons born outside of the United States (or specified U.S. territories).  Between December 24, 1952 and November 13, 1986, the law specified that if you were born outside of the United States and only one of your parents was a citizen, that parent must have resided in the United States for at least 10 years, at least 5 of which were after the age of 16. The qualifications for president are set in Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution: “No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.” After these two eRumors circulated, an Illinois attorney filed a lawsuit claiming that Obama was not born in Hawaii but was born in the African country of Kenya.

He was the keynote speaker at an the “Building a Covenant for A New America” conference sponsored by a group called the Call to Renewal. Click here for the video It was one of Obama’s more religiously-based speeches that talked about the tensions that exist in a country of secular laws but religious passions. He argued that “secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square.” He called for a “reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism” and called on those with narrow religious views to translate those into broader common values that can guide public policy. As an example, he said, “And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson’s, or Al Sharpton’s? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount – a passage that is so radical that it’s doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let’s read our bibles. Folks haven’t been reading their bibles.” This statement caused controversy among Evangelical Christians because it seemed as though Obama was being cynical about what could appear to be confecting statements in scripture. Obama’s supporters say, however, that he was not making fun of those scriptures but merely using them to illustrate the point of his speech, which was to point out the complexity of holding religious values in high regard but trying to reconcile them with public policy.

Some versions of this eRumor ask if Joe Biden is going to   be our interim President before the end of this year. "," There was no such Associated Press Story and all indications lead us to believe that this was an April Fools Joke in 2009. This hoax that first appeared on April 1, 2009 has had a few modifications over the years and refuses to die. There was a court case on January 24, 2010 in Southern California’s Santa Ana Supreme Court filed by attorney Orly Taitz  but Judge David O. Carter, who presided over the case, dismissed it. In a written statement, Carter said that the court cannot “sweep away the votes of over 68 million Americans with the stroke of a pen, ” and “that the U.S. Constitution does not give the court jurisdiction to decide the matter.” An Occidental College spokesperson told TruthorFiction.com that President Obama’s records are still sealed and no such transcripts have been released. When asked if the future President used the Obama or Soetoro name at the college, the spokesperson said that although he had not seen the sealed transcripts he had seen a 1981 photo book that was handed out to students and faculty at the beginning of the college year with student photos, names and hometown information. The 1981 photo book had “Barack Obama” under the student’s photo and indicated a home state as Hawaii. There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. The program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and each year awards approximately 7,500 grants. The grants are for both American students who want to study abroad and foreign students who want to study in the US. To be eligible certain criteria must be met. Below is the original 2009 version of this email as appeared on April First 2009: April 1, 2009 AP- WASHINGTON D.C. – In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama’s qualifications for the presidency, the group “Americans for Freedom of Information” has released copies of President Obama’s college transcripts from Occidental College. Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama’s detractors have been seeking. The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama’s legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administration’s efforts to move the country in a new direction. Britain’s Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, “Obama Eligibility Questioned”, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama’s first official visit to the U.K. In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama’s legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama’s dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrio’s case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama’s citizenship or qualification to serve as president. Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama’s campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.

"," Did Michelle Obama say “For the first time in my    adult lifetime I am proud of my country?”- Truth! It was during speeches in Milwaukee and    Madison, Wisconsin on February 18, 2008. In Milwaukee she said, “ People    in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of    politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my    country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.” In Madison, she said, ““For    the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country … not    just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry    for change.  I have been desperate to see our country moving in that    direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and    disappointment.” A spokesperson for the Obama Campaign,    Jan Psake, said Michelle Obama was not trying to knock her country but    rather to “underscore the meaning behind her husband’s campaign.”     She added, “ The    point is that of course Michelle is proud of her country, which is why she    and Barack talk constantly about how their story wouldn’t be possible in    any other nation on Earth.  What she meant is that she’s really proud    at this moment because for the first time in a long time, thousands of    Americans who’ve never participated in politics before are coming out in    record numbers to build a grassroots movement for change.” Critics, however, seized upon her    statement and wondered aloud why there would not be any other times in her    adult life when she felt proud of her country. Has Michelle Obama’s Princeton thesis    been restricted for any public release until after November 5?- Previously    Truth! But it has now been    released from restriction! Princeton University released the    thesis to the public on March 25, 2008, after criticism of the fact that    it was being held for release until the day after the general election. The thesis was written under her maiden name, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson.     At Princeton, Michelle Obama focused on sociology and earned a certificate    in African-American studies. The title of the thesis was    “Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.” An article in the Daily Princetonian from March 26, 2008, quoted the    thesis as examining “…how the attitudes of black alumni have changed    over the course of their time at the University” and “…whether they will    become more or less motivated to benefit the black community.” She surveyed 89 black graduates of Princeton and concluded from her    research that “attending the University as an undergraduate decreased the    extent to which black alumni identified with the black community as a    whole.” No explanation has been given for why    the thesis was restricted for public access, although that can be    requested by an alumnus.

The Stern website posted this description for October first show: “Howard started off the show playing a few clips of Sal asking black people if they were voting for Obama, and attributed all of McCain’s political policies to Obama to see if they would still vote for him. All the interviewees readily agreed with Obama when Sal lied to them about his pro-life, anti-stem-cell research and pro-war policies. Howard said the clips were revealing, and Sal came in to say he thought the election had become less about ideas and, instead, some kind of race war.” Of the three people questioned, two said they are voting for Obama because he is Pro-Life, two said they are voting for Obama because he wants to stay in Iraq and finish the war and one because Obama is against stem cell research.   All said that they had no problem with Sarah Palin being vice president.

General   Assembly in 2000.  He quotes a Millennium Project official as saying   that the U.S. would be forced to pay 0.7 percent of Gross National   Product in increased foreign aid spending.  That would be $65 billion a   year over what the U.S. currently spends in foreign aid and over a   13-year period from 2002 to 2015 when the U.S. is expected to reach the   Millennium Development Goals.  That adds up to $845 billion. In addition, the Millennium Development Goals include banning “small   arms and light weapons” in all nations involved in the project. The bill was considered   by a Senate committee and introduced to the Senate in December of 2007   and on April 24, 2008 it was placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under   General Orders.

"President Obama Delayed Thunderbirds Air Show Following Air Force Academy Graduation- Fiction!","2015-03-09 21:40:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/air-force-academy-thunderbirds/"," This is a forwarded email about the 2012 graduation ceremony at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO on May 23rd.  At the end of every graduation ceremony there is a traditional fly over by the United States Air Force Thunderbirds that is followed by an air show.  The fly over is a precision maneuver where the Thunderbirds fly over the graduates at the same moment that the future U.S. Air Force Officers toss their combination caps in the air.  Following the fly over the Thunderbirds perform an air show for the assembled crowd.  The email says that President Obama had to leave after the Thunderbirds conducted their flyover, which resulted in a costly delay of the scheduled performance of the precision flying team. "," There was a delay between the Thunderbird flyover and the scheduled air show that followed the graduation ceremony according to a May 23, 2012 article in the Colorado Springs Gazette , but the delay happens every year. A Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs told TruthOrFiction.com that the delay was normal and had nothing to do with the President’s departure from the area. This portion of the Air Force Academy graduation was something to see. At the very end of the graduation ceremony the Master of Ceremonies announced that the Class of 2012 was dismissed.  At that moment the graduates tossed their combination caps in the air and the Thunderbirds perform their flyover. Once the caps are in the air children from the audience are released into the graduate area to retrieve the tossed caps and are allowed to keep them as a souvenir. The children are then escorted to an area where their parents can meet up with them to return them to their seats. An information page showing the scheduled events involving the graduation is posted on the Academy web site, which shows the air show beginning approximately thirty minutes after the close of the graduation ceremony.

Updated 2013: President Obama spoke at the U.S. Naval academy commencement ceremony on May 24, 2013 .   It is not required that a sitting U.S. President attend the commencement ceremonies every year for all the military academies.   Vice President Biden spoke to the class of 2009 and Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley was the 2013 commencement speaker at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 2013 the Thunderbirds were unable to make the traditional flyover because of sequestration but their was a flyover of historical World War II aircraft by the Texas Flying Legends.  This according to an article in the Commemorative Air Force web site .  The article said, ‘Support for these flyovers is also being provided by the Texas Flying Legends, Commemorative Air Force and the National Museum of World War II Aviation.”  The Commemorative Air Force is an organization that was founded to “acquire, restore and preserve in flying condition a complete collection of combat aircraft which were flown by all military services of the United States.” Posted 06/18/12   Updated 06./04/13 ","Obama"
