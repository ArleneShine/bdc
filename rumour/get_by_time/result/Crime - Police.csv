"Standing Rock Police Turn in Badges-Unproven!","2016-11-29 13:36:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/standing-rock-police-turn-badges/"," At least two police officers turned in their badges at the Standing Rock protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline because they don’t agree with actions being taken there, and it’s not what they signed up for. "," Rumors that police officers turned in their badges at the Standing Rock protest can’t be confirmed. The rumor appears to have started in early November with a Facebook post by Ryan Redhawk, a leader of the Standing Rock Rising Movement: The post was quickly picked up by blog sites and was widely shared hundreds of thousands of times on social media. But these posts misconstrued the original post. Redhawk didn’t actually confirm that any police officers had turned in their badges — he said he heard reports of that, which is not the same thing. The website True Activist , for example, cited Redhawk’s post in reporting that “At least two police officers turned in their badges today after acknowledging that attacking peaceful protestors is not what they signed up for.” In reality, Redhawk’s post said there were “at least two reports of police officers turning in their badges” — not that “at least two police officers turned in their badges,” as True Activist reported in a story that was shared half a million times. There’s been no indication that police at the Standing Rock Protests have objected to actions taken against protestors there, or turned in their badges because of it.","Crime - Police"
"Ford Foundation Donates $100 Million to Black Lives Matter-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-26 14:21:02","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ford-foundation-donates-100-million-to-black-lives-matter/"," The Ford Foundation has pledged $100 million in support to Black Lives Matter, leading to calls for a boycott of Ford. "," It’s true that the Ford Foundation has pledged $100 million to the Black-Led Movement Fund (BLMF), a coalition of social justice organizations endorsed by Black Lives Matter. But the Ford Foundation hasn’t been connected to the Ford Motor Company for more than 40 years. First, we’ll start out by providing some background about Black Lives Matter, BLMF and the Movement for Black Lives since the connections between these organizing and fundraising networks can be confusing. In July 2016, the Ford Foundation announced that it would partner with Borealis Philanthropy, Movement Strategy Center and Benedict Consulting to found BLMF. In turn, BLMF will serve as a donor network supporting the Movement for Black Lives , a social justice movement endorsed by Black Lives Matter, according to a foundation blog post: The Movement for Black Lives has created an opportunity for philanthropy to see and learn from new and dynamic forms of social justice leadership and infrastructure. To support and fund this thriving movement, philanthropy itself has had to adapt. Meanwhile, leaders have kept donors’ good intentions in check with candid reminders of how philanthropy can hurt a movement, as well as how it can help. Listening and learning is central to Ford’s approach, as we strive to be a thoughtful, effective social justice funder at this critical time.By partnering with Borealis Philanthropy, Movement Strategy Center, and Benedict Consulting to found the Black-Led Movement Fund, Ford has made six-year investments in the organizations and networks that compose the Movement for Black Lives. Borealis Philanthropy, meanwhile, provides a little more insight about the goal of BLMF at its website: The Black-Led Movement Fund (BLMF), led by Borealis Philanthropy, is a collaborative and pooled donor fund established by the Ford Foundation and Anonymous Donors. In partnership with donors and activists, the BLMF aims to support philanthropic and field-building activities that strengthen the next generation of social justice leaders.  Specifically, the collaborative effort supports the infrastructure, innovation and dynamism of intersectional Black-led organizing that have become integral components of what many call the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). Rumors about the Ford Foundation pledging more than $100 million to Black Lives Matter went viral after the announcement. The Washington Times reported that Black Lives matter had cashed in with the Ford Foundation’s donation — and, aside from (falsely) implying that Black Lives Matter would receive the entire $100 million donation, the report was factually correct. But, as similar reports spread across social media and conservative news sites, details started getting fuzzy. Freedom Daily, a right-wing website, demonstrates how that happened in a post calling for a Ford boycott that was shared nearly 30,000 times on social media within a week that begins: Ford just donated $100 million dollars to Black Lives Matter. The Washington Post reported: street uprising, Black Lives Matter is increasingly awash in cash, raking in pledges of more than $100 million from liberal foundations and others eager to contribute to what has become the grant-making cause du jour. This story (and calls for Ford boycotts that followed it) made three critical errors: it confused the Washington Post with the Washington Times , it confused the Ford Motor Company with the Ford Foundation, and it confused the Black-Led Movement Fund with Black Lives Matter. In reality, the Ford Motor Company and the Ford Foundation are completely separate organizations since the 1970s. Henry Ford’s son, Edsel, started the Ford Foundation in 1936 with an initial gift of $25,000. The foundation took in huge bequests from Henry and Edsel’s estates upon their deaths in the 1940s and grew to become the biggest philanthropy in the world at the time. Edsel’s son, Henry Ford II, was involved in the Ford Foundation up until 1976, but the foundation began selling off Ford stocks in the 1950s and moved its headquarters from Dearborn, Michigan, to New York City in the 1960s. Ford II resigned over the foundation’s “ march to the left ” in 1976, and no Ford family member has served on the board of trustees since. Today, the Ford Motor Company has a separate nonprofit arm, the Ford Fund , and is in no way connected to the Ford Foundation. In the end, the Ford Foundation and the Ford Motor Company are completely separate organizations. And the Ford Foundation pledged $100 million to the Black-Led Movement Fund, which is not the same thing as Black Lives Matter. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction. ","Crime - Police"
"Released from Prison by Obama, Wendell Callahan Killed 3 People-Mostly Fiction!","2016-09-07 10:46:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/released-prison-obama-wendell-callahan-killed-3-people/"," Wendell Callahan, a man who was serving time on crack-cocaine charges, murdered his ex-girlfriend and her two children after President Obama gave him early release. "," The tragic details of this case are true — but Wendell Callahan was released due to reforms in federal prison sentencing guidelines, not because Obama pardoned him. Callahan was charged with three counts of aggravated murder in January 2016 for allegedly stabbing to death a woman and two young children, according to complaints filed in Franklin County Circuit Court in Ohio. Callahan faces the death penalty in the case, which is still pending. The Columbus Post Dispatch reported shortly after Callahan’s arrest that he had been given early release from federal prison on a 12-½ year sentence for selling crack that was handed down in 2007: The man charged with killing an ex-girlfriend and two of her children in a North Side stabbing rampage early on Tuesday likely would have been deep into a 12 1/2-year federal prison sentence if sentencing guidelines for convicted crack dealers had remained unchanged. Wendell L. Callahan, 35, twice benefited from changes in federal sentencing guidelines, which reduced his sentence by a total of more than four years, from the 150 months he was first given in 2007, to 110 months in 2008 including time served, and 100 months in 2011. Columbus police charged Callahan on Tuesday with three counts of murder in the deaths of ex-girlfriend Erveena Hammonds, 32, and her daughters, Breya Hammonds, 7, and Anaesia Green, 10. A number of media outlets have since reported that Callahan had been “pardoned” by Obama — but that’s not true. Callahan’s federal sentence was shortened by an amendment to federal sentencing guidelines that went into effect on November 1, 2007 — more than a year before Obama took office, according to a report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission: On May 1, 2007, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(a) and (p), the Commission submitted to Congress amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines that became effective on November 1, 2007. One of those amendments, Amendment 706, modified the drug quantity thresholds in the Drug Quantity Table of §2D1.1 so as to assign, for crack cocaine offenses, base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that include the statutory mandatory minimum penalties. Crack cocaine offenses for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quantities similarly were adjusted downward by two levels. The amendment also included a mechanism to determine a combined base offense level in an offense involving crack cocaine and other controlled substances. On December 11, 2007, the Commission voted to promulgate Amendment 713, which added Amendment 706 as amended by 711, to the amendments listed in subsection (c) in §1B1.10 that apply retroactively. The Commission voted to make Amendment 713 effective on March 3, 2008. As a result, some incarcerated offenders are eligible to receive a reduction in their sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) pursuant to Amendment 706. And the second time Callahan’s sentence was reduced — from 110 months to 100 months — was approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama in August 2010. The law reduced the disparity between sentences for crack-cocaine and power cocaine, the Sentencing Commission reports : This report provides data concerning the retroactive application of the guideline amendment implementation of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), Pub. L. No. 111–220, signed into law on August 3, 2010. The FSA increased the quantities of crack cocaine that trigger the five and ten-year statutory mandatory minimum penalties — from five grams to 28 grams for fiveyear mandatory minimums and from 50 to 280 grams for ten-year mandatory minimums — and eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine. Significantly, the FSA gave the Commission emergency amendment authority to temporarily change the guidelines to implement the statutory changes and to add certain enhancements and reductions to the guidelines. So, it’s true that Obama signed Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 into law — but Congress drafted and approved the bill with bipartisan support. It’s misleading to place the blame for any consequences solely on Obama. That’s why we’re call this one “mostly fiction.” ","Crime - Police"

"," Reports of Shawn Lucas’s death are true, but no details about the cause or manner of his death have been released yet. The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department confirmed the death of Lucas, 38, to multiple media outlets. Additionally, Lucas’s family and friends have confirmed on social media that he died suddenly on August 2nd. Shawn Lucas served the DNC and Debbie Wasserman Shultz with a class action lawsuit that alleges “fraud and other claims” against both parties for colluding with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign to “perpetrate a fraud on the public” by favoring Clinton. Video of Lucas’s serving papers at the DNC headquarters on July 3rd can be viewed here . The DNC named Shawn Lucas as one of the process servers in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for insufficient service . The motion contends that the papers were served to the wrong person at the DNC: On July 6, 2016, Plaintiffs filed affidavits of service of process, in which Shawn Lucas and Brandon Yoshimura of One Source Process, Inc. claim to have served Rebecca Christopher (described by the affidavits as a “Creative Strategist”) with process for both the DNC and its Chair at 1:30 p.m. on July 1st. See Aff. of Service of Process on DNC (ECF No. 6); Aff. of Service of Process on DNC Chair (ECF No. 7). In fact, the person with whom Mr. Lucas and Mr. Yoshimura interacted was not Ms. Christopher, but a different DNC employee named Rebecca Herries. See Decl. of Rebecca Herries In Support of Mot. to Dismiss (“Herries Decl.”) 1, 2. Ms. Herries is not authorized to accept service of process for the DNC, its Chair in any capacity, or the CEO, for whom she works as a special assistant. Id. 2. Ms. Herries came to the lobby to meet Mr. Lucas and Mr. Yoshimura after she was repeatedly advised by security that Mr. Lucas and Mr. Yoshimura were refusing to leave unless they could hand some legal papers to a DNC staffer. Id. 3, 4. It was Friday afternoon right before the Fourth of July weekend and, after unsuccessfully attempting to contact the DNC’s Chief Operating Officer or anyone in the operations department, Ms. Herries went downstairs to speak with Mr. Lucas and Mr. Yoshimura. ¶ 3. She told them that her name was “Becca” and that she worked for the DNC. Id. 4. They did not ask her for and she did not give them her last name or her title. Id. They similarly did not ask whether she was authorized to accept process for either Defendant, and she did not make any representations to that effect. Id. They handed her the documents and left. Reports of Lucas’s unexpected death, coupled with his role as a public challenger of both Clinton and the DNC, sparked conspiracy theories among right-wing media outlets. Zero Hedge (incorrectly) reported that Lucas was the “lead attorney” in the anti-fraud lawsuit. He was actually a process server who worked at Once Source Process in Washington, D.C. The Zero Hedge story , which appeared under the headline, “Lead Attorney in Anti-Clinton DNC Fraud Case Mysteriously Found Dead,” was shared more than 25,000 times within days of being published. At this point it’s clear that Lucas died unexpectedly and tragically on August 2nd. Beyond that, no details about the cause or manner of his death have been made available, so any theories about his death are unproven. Lucas’s family and friends have set up a Go Fund Me page that can be viewed here.","Crime - Police"
"Clinton Researcher Victor Thorn Found Dead-Truth!","2016-08-08 13:22:29","https://www.truthorfiction.com/clinton-researcher-victor-thorn-found-dead/"," Prolific Clinton researcher Victor Thorn (also known as Scott Robert Makufka) has been found dead. "," Clinton researcher Victor Thorn, whose birth name was Scott Robert Makufka, died of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on August 1st, according to his family. Victor Thorn regularly published books and articles that were critical of Bill and Hillary Clinton, including “ Hillary (And Bill ),” a three-part trilogy that includes “The Sex Volume,” “The Drugs Volume,” and “The Murder Volume,” which tells of political operatives, allies and enemies of the Clintons who have died under (supposedly) suspicious circumstances over the years. That led right-wing websites to imply that Victor Thorn had himself been the victim of a Clinton death plan days after Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination. However, there’s currently no evidence to support that claim. American Free Press , a website that regularly published Victor Thorn bylines, first reported the Clinton researcher and author’s death on August 1st. Thorn died “at the top of a mountain near his home, the apparent victim of a gunshot wound” on his 54th birthday, the website reported. Thorn’s family said there was no evidence of foul play, and he most likely took his own life. In an appearance on the American Free Press podcast , Victor Thorn’s brother, William J. Makufka, choked up while talking about the life and death of his brother. When asked how he explained the timing of Thorn’s death, his brother responded: He absolutely did not like dealing with death and sickness … Scott did not want to get old. He was, and we still are and right now, watching my parents who are in their early 80s go through a lot of health issues. I’m sure that played a part. It is also my true belief that Scott very much believed that death isn’t the end and we continue on … He truly believed his journey was done and he wanted to see what came next. So, reports that Clinton researcher and author Victor Thorn was found dead on the morning of August 1st are true. But his family has disputes the idea that a sinister plot or foul play involved.

"UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police-Fiction!","2016-08-05 14:09:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/un-backs-secret-obama-takeover-police/"," The United Nations has backed President Obama’s secret plan to nationalize local police departments. "," The UN hasn’t backed Obama’s secret plan to takeover local police departments — and we couldn’t find evidence to prove that a “secret plan” like that exists. These rumors stem from a statement released by Maina Kiai , a human rights attorney from Kenya who was appointed by the UN Human Rights Commission to research and report on “the rights of freed of peaceful assembly and of association” in the United States in July 2016. One paragraph of Kiai’s lengthy statement drew speculation about the UN backing Obama’s police takeover: “The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice has provided oversight and recommendations for improvement of police services in a number of cities with consent decrees. This is one of the most effective ways to reduce discrimination in law enforcement and it needs to be beefed up and increased to cover as many of the 18,000-plus local law enforcement jurisdictions.” A website called Lifezette started rumors that Kiai’s statement meant the UN had backed a nationalized police force in the United States. In an article published August 4th under the headline, “UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police,” the website reports: (That quote was from) United Nations Rapporteur Maina Kai on July 27, a representative of the U.N. Human Rights Council, who on the tail-end of touring the U.S., endorsed a little-known and yet highly controversial practice by the Justice Department to effect a federal takeover of local police and corrections departments. The story’s first mistake is that it mischaracterizes exactly what a “special rapporteur” is and falsely implied in the headline that Kiai’s statement amounted to a UN endorsement. In reality, a special rapporteur is an independent expert that the UN Human Rights Council has appointed to examine and report back on events unfolding in a country, or on a particular human rights theme. Then, the UN Human Rights Commission reviews and critiques that report and decides whether or not to act on it, according to special procedures of the Human Rights Council: The Commission on Human Rights exercises oversight over the work of the experts while keeping in mind that the experts are irremovable, independent and are immune from legal process . It examines their reports and passes resolutions either welcoming or criticizing the work of the expert, or simply takes note of their action …. Simply put, a special rapporteur does not speak for the UN; Kiai’s statement doesn’t amount to the UN “backing” anything. rapporteurLifezette explains Obama’s “secret plans” to take control of local police departments by issuing a flurry of the “consent decrees” (which Kiai endorsed in his statement): The consent decrees are already being implemented in Newark, New Jersey; Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Ferguson, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; and other municipalities… In short, the much-feared nationalization of local police departments is already being initiated by the Obama administration’s Justice Department. And somehow nobody noticed. But those claims about where consent decrees have been issued are misleading, and in some instances they’re false. The Los Angeles consent decree was issued under Bill Clinton in the 1990s — not Obama. The Miami consent decree was issued due to violations of the Clean Water Act — it had nothing do with police. Chicago, meanwhile, asked for a DOJ investigation of police tactics in December 2015 , and the review is ongoing (no consent decree has been issued). The story did, however, correctly report the Ferguson and Newark consent decrees reached under Obama. But a Washington Post review of the number of DOJ investigations launched and the number of consent decrees reached over the last two decades don’t support the idea that Obama is secretly trying to use them to create a nationalized police force: In the past two decades, the Justice Department has launched 67 civil rights investigations of police departments. Nine remain unresolved. Of the completed investigations, 24 were closed without reform agreements, meaning investigators did not have sufficient evidence to prove civil rights abuses or the agencies informally resolved the problems, officials said. In eight investigations, Justice documented patterns of civil rights abuses­ and won promises from the departments to reform. Those cases were settled out of court with no independent or federal oversight. Twenty-six investigations — a little more than half of them since President Obama took office — have led to the most rigorous outcome: binding agreements tracked by monitors. More than half were consent decrees, meaning they were approved and managed in federal court. In the end, there doesn’t seem to be sufficient evidence to prove that Obama is using consent decrees to secretly takeover the country’s police forces. And the UN hasn’t endorsed that — even though a special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Commission did. ","Crime - Police"

"Alton Sterling Arrest Record Media Won’t Tell You About-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-07-18 15:50:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alton-sterling-arrest-record-media-wont-tell/"," Reports that the media has ignored the fact that Alton Sterling had a lengthy criminal record before he was fatally shot by a police officer in Baton Rouge on July 5th. "," It’s true that Alton Sterling had a lengthy criminal record, but many national media outlets have covered or noted his previous arrests. Alton Sterling was convicted of criminal charges 20 times from 1996 to 2009. Those charges included robbery, aggravated burglary, resisting an officer, as well as multiple gun and drug charges. Heavy has put together criminal complaints for all of those cases that can be viewed here . And, in addition to the charges that Alton Sterling was convicted of, nearly 20 additional charges filed against Sterling from 1996 to 2016 had been dismissed. Two cases in particular have stood out in the wake of Sterling’s death. In a 2009 case, Sterling resisted arrest and the officer reported, “wresting with the defendant on the ground,” until a “black semi auto gun fell from his waistband” and Sterling was detained without further incident. In another case, an officer reported in a probable cause affidavit that he pulled Sterling over for driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone and found that he did not have proof of insurance. The office let Sterling collect his belongings from the car, and as he walked away, Sterling reportedly said he would “have the officers’ badge and jobs” and that they should “go ahead and beat him down regardless of the outcome” before he lied down in the street. Also, it’s been noted that Sterling was a registered sex offender, and the offense description was listed as “carnal knowledge of a juvenile” in an online database of sex offenders in Louisiana. Alton Sterling’s lengthy criminal history has lead to reports from conservative commentators like Allen B. West have argued that liberals, media outlets and those protesting Sterling’s death don’t want you know about his past and have largely ignored it. However, a quick check of media reports does no support the idea that the media shied away from, or failed to report, Sterling’s run-ins with the law. The Washington Post , for example, published an extensive profile on Sterling’s troubled past. The piece begins: BATON ROUGE — Alton Sterling, the black man whose point-blank shooting by white police set off a fresh round of national protest against police aggression against black people, was born and raised in this impoverished and racially divided Louisiana state capital and barely knew a life without police in it. His mother died when he was 14, and his father by the time he was 19, Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Sterling’s oldest son, said in an interview Tuesday. “Alton pretty much raised himself,” she said. And trouble was never far away. Sterling, who lived a life of poverty and instability, in and out of jail, was in many ways the embodiment of an American — and particularly, a Louisianan — justice system that legal experts say is skewed heavily against black Americans and that protesters have rallied against over the past week. The New York Times also noted Sterling’s criminal history in its early reports : Mr. Sterling had a long criminal history, including convictions for battery and illegal possession of a gun, but it is not clear whether the officers knew any of that as they tried to arrest him. The same can be said of USA Today , CBS News and countless other media outlets. The idea that the media or protestors have shied away from Sterling’s criminal record is false. Rather, as Bustle reports , his supporters argue that Sterling’s criminal past doesn’t justify police shooting him: Sterling’s record, obviously, is not clear. But these matters are unrelated to his death. As an individual, selling CDs outside of a convenience store is not a crime for which anyone should be gunned down. And now as a symbol within a larger movement, Sterling, a black man, could have just as likely been killed unjustly, regardless of his previous record. We’ve seen it with other cases — like Trayvon Martin, who had no criminal record but saw his short 17 years on Earth dug up to be tarnished just the same. Yet this increasingly common, explicit display of force by the officers, whose body cameras allegedly fell off during the struggle, points not so much to the individual but to a larger problem within the system: the overwhelming and systemic violence inflicted upon people of color by law enforcement in the United States. So, it’s true that Alton Sterling had a lengthy criminal record, but it’s false that media have tried to hide or ignore that fact. ","Crime - Police"
"Assassination of Top Democratic Official Leads to Capture of Clinton Hit Team-Fiction!","2016-07-15 10:40:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/assassination-top-democratic-official-leads-capture-clinton-hit-team/"," A report that the assassination of a top Democratic Party official named Seth Rich while he was on his way to testify about Hillary Clinton has led to the FBI capturing a so-called Clinton “Hit Team.” "," It’s true that Seth Rich was an employee of the Democratic National Party that was murdered in Washington, D.C., in July 2016. But reports that Rich was on his way to testify about Hillary Clinton, or that his “assassination” has led to the FBI capturing a Clinton “hit team” are false. WUSA 9 in Washington reported that Rich was shot and killed in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Northwest D.C. in what appeared to be a robbery gone wrong: The shooting happened in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW on Sunday at 4:19 a.m., Metropolitan Police said. Police arrived at the scene and found Conrad conscious and breathing. He was suffering from gunshot wounds. Conrad was taken to the hospital where he later died from his injuries. “A lot of my girlfriends around here are talking about this and looking out for one another. We don’t want anyone walking by themselves,” neighbor Katie Ferguson said. “It’s scary. I want something done and so far there is a lot of talk, but what’s really being done?” Officials said they are looking into the possibility that Rich’s murder is connected to other recent robberies in the area. The sad story of Seth Rich’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them. What Does It Mean quickly spread the Russian propaganda in the U.S. with a story appearing under the headline, “Assassination of Top U.S. Democratic Party Official Leads to FBI Capture of Clinton Team,” that reports : A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City. Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place. There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights. While robbery has been cited as a motive in Rich’s death, it’s still not clear why he was murdered. His parents told the Inquisitor that if it was an attempted robbery, his attacker had failed since Rich still had cash on him when he was found So, while it’s not clear why Rich was murdered, reports that he was assassinated by a Clinton hit team that came from Russian propaganda should be considered fiction.

Black Lives do not matter to most black people. Only the lives that make the national news matter to them. Only the lives that are taken at the hands of cops or white people, matter. The other thousands of lives lost, the other black souls that I along with every cop, have seen taken at the hands of other blacks, do not matter. Their deaths are unnoticed, accepted as the “norm”, and swept underneath the rug by the very people who claim and post “black lives matter”. I realized that this country is full of ignorance, where an educated individual will watch the ratings-driven news media, and watch a couple YouTube video clips, and then come to the conclusion that they have all the knowledge they need to have in order to know what it feels like to have a bullet proof vest as part of your office equipment, “Stay Alive” as part of your daily to do list, and having insurance for your health insurance because of the high rate of death in your profession…. Stalien continued that he watched black people kill black people in the neighborhood where he grew up over nothing, and he voiced frustration that black communities often refuse to help police bring killers of black men to justice: “I watched and lived through the crime that took place in the hood. My own black people killing others over nothing. Crack heads and heroin addicts lined the lobby of my building as I shuffled around them to make my way to our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 of us living inside. I wanted to help my community and stop watching the blood of African Americans spilled on the street at the hands of a fellow black man.” They called me ‘Uncle Tom’, and ‘wanna be white boy’, and I couldn’t understand why … Women attacking me, wishing for my death, wishing for the death of my family. I was so confused, so torn, I couldn’t understand why my own black people would turn against me, when every time they called …I was there. Every time someone died….I was there. Every time they were going through one of the worst moments in their lives…I was there. So why was I the enemy? The post has generated a lot of debate, and it generated support from many people who commented that they also supported the Black Lives Matter movement. And, while most of the post is Stalien’s personal opinion, he does include two specific claims that can be fact checked: Cities with Higher Populations of Black People Will Always Have Higher Arrest Rates for Black People- Disputed! It’s true that cities like Baltimore (which Stalien specifically cited) where more black people live than white (63 percent to 31 percent), it would make sense for there to be higher arrest rates for black people. But how much higher the arrest rate for black people should be in a city like Baltimore is debatable. In 2010, black people accounted for 90 percent of the city’s jail population despite accounting for just 63 percent of the overall population, the Justice Policy Institute reports . And police targeting or racial profile aren’t the only reasons, either. High school graduation rates, poverty levels and high unemployment all contribute to black people being incarcerated at higher numbers in large cities like Baltimore, the NAACP reports . Finally, disparities between the number of black and white people arrested persists around the country, not just in cities with majority black populations. A USA Today review found that at least 70 police departments from Connecticut to California arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people. So, black people seeing higher arrest rates than white people  is a complicated issue without clearcut answers. That’s why we’re calling this one “disputed.” Blacks Aren’t Killed More by Police than Whites- Truth! & Misleading! From 2004 to 2013, 289 white people were killed by police compared to 243 black people. That means whites accounted for 53 percent of police shootings compared to 44 percent for blacks, according to FBI stats . That can be misleading, however, considering that blacks account for a disproportionate amount of police shooting deaths based on population size. After all, black account for 13.3 percent of the overall population, but 44 percent of police fatalities. Overall, the Chicago Tribune reports , black people are 2.5 times more likely to die at the hands of police than white people. Given that white people killed more frequently by cops, but black people are killed in higher proportion to their population size, we’re calling that claim true and misleading. ","Crime - Police"
"Philandro Castile Was an Armed Robbery Suspect-Mostly Fiction!","2016-07-11 13:09:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/philandro-castile-armed-robbery-suspect/"," Philandro Castile, a black man who was killed by a white police officer just outside of St. Paul, Minnesota, was a suspect in an armed robbery. "," Police in Minnesota have not identified Philandro Castile as an armed robbery suspect. Those rumors started shortly after an audio recording of police radio chatter just before Philandro Castile and his girlfriend were pulled over was released to the public. In the recording, the St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez can be heard radioing to dispatch that Castile and his girlfriend matched the description of two armed robbery suspects in the area before he pulled them over: I’m going to stop a car… I’m going to check IDs. I have reason to pull it over. The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just ‘cause of the wide set nose. It not clear exactly which armed robbery Yanez was referring to, but the St. Antony Police department had issued a press release earlier in the week saying that they were investigating a gas station robbery that had occurred on July 2nd blocks from the traffic stop, Lillie News reports : Armed with handguns, two men robbed a convenience store in Lauderdale early in the evening of July 2. According to a press release from the St. Anthony Police Department, which contracts for police service in Lauderdale, the two robbed the Super USA store in the 2400 block of Larpenteur Avenue around 7:30 p.m., taking cash from the register and cartons of Newport cigarettes. No employees were injured during the robbery said St. Anthony Police Chief Jon Mangseth. Police also released surveillance camera footage of one of the robbery suspects, who was shown to be an unmasked black male with long dreadlocks: That revelation led to fringe media outlets like The Conservative Tree House reporting that it was “confirmed” that Philandro Castile was an armed robbery suspect. However, just because an officer said that Philandro Castile had a passing resemblance to an armed robbery suspect, that doesn’t mean that he actually was actually an armed robbery suspect. And following Castile’s death, Minnesota authorities made no mention of him being a suspect in any armed robbery and said that he was stopped for a broken taillight. And, a quick check of Philandro Castile’s online court records showed that he had a number of traffic infractions on his record, but no history of serious crime or pending charges for armed robbery against him. Given the fact that Castile has not been identified as an armed robbery suspect, but the arresting officer said he looked like an armed robbery suspect, we’re calling this one “mostly fiction.” ","Crime - Police"
"Comparisons Between Major Jason Brezler, Hillary Clinton Email Cases- Mostly Truth!","2016-07-07 13:15:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/comparisons-major-jason-brezler-hillary-clinton-email-case/"," Comparisons between the cases of Major Jason Brezler, a Marine who was accused of sending confidential information over a private email account that saved American lives, and Hillary Clinton have gone viral. "," Similarities between the Major Jason Brezler and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sending classified information over personal email accounts ring mostly true. First, its important to note that neither Brezler nor Clinton faced criminal charges for sending classified documents over private email accounts and/or private email servers. A panel of officers recommended that he be discharged from the Marine Corps during an administrative hearing — but he wasn’t charged criminally. Second, investigators found that Brezler had sent more than 100 classified documents with his personal email account — not just the one involving a corrupt Afghan police chief. That situation unfolded in 2012 when Major Jason Brezler sent an email containing a classified document from his personal Yahoo! Account to warn a fellow Marine that Sarwar Jan, an Afghan police chief, was corrupt, Foreign Policy reports : Brezler had responded in July 2012 to a request for information from deployed Marines about the police chief, Sarwar Jan, who Brezler helped to oust from power in another district in Afghanistan during a deployment spanning parts of 2009 and 2010. On August 10, 2012, just weeks after Brezler sent his warning, the police chief’s teenage servant and alleged sex abuse victim, Aynoddin, opened fire on a U.S. base, killing three Marines and critically wounding a fourth. Now, Brezler is expected to go before an administrative board in December that could oust him from the Marine Corps. Lt. Gen. Richard Mills took action against Brezler for sending the classified document via personal email account (even though he reportedly saved lives by doing so), and following an administrative hearing in 2013, a panel of officers recommended that Brezler be discharge from the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps Times reports : The Pentagon’s investigative agency has cleared the commanding general of Marine Forces Reserve of whistleblower reprisal against a Marine civil affairs officer who reached out to a member of Congress for help. In a new report, the Defense Department Inspector General’s office found that while Lt. Gen. Richard Mills did take adverse administrative action against Maj. Jason Brezler — touted in media reports last year as a hero for warning about a war-zone threat — Mills’ actions were not motivated by retaliation. After FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a personal email server, despite “evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information,” there was public outcry from those who compared the cases of Brezler and Clinton. For his part, Major Bezler, who has been locked in a legal battle over his handling of classified information, said through an attorney that he would use Comey’s determination about Clinton’s use of a personal email server to argue his case, the Washington Post reports : An attorney for Brezler, Michael J. Bowe, said that he intends to cite the treatment of Clinton “as one of the many, and most egregious examples” of how severely Brezler was punished. FBI Director James B. Comey announced Tuesday that he would not recommend the U.S. government pursue federal charges against Clinton, but he rebuked her “extremely careless” use of a private, unclassified email server while serving as secretary of state. The FBI found that 110 of her emails contained classified information. So, comparisons between the two cases ring mostly true. Neither Clinton nor Brezler faced criminal charges for sending the classified documents — but Brezler faced substantial punishment from superior officers who recommended his discharge.

"," It’s true that a gun owner with a concealed carry permit stopped an active shooter outside a nightclub in South Carolina in June 2016. The shooting unfolded outside Playoffz nightclub in Lyman, South Carolina, in the early morning hours of June 26th. Officials with the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Department told 10 WISTV that 32-year-old Jody Ray Thompson fired a gun into a crowd outside the nightclub after he got into an argument: “His rounds struck three victims, and almost struck a fourth victim, who in self-defense, pulled his own weapon and fired, striking Thompson in the leg,” Lt. Kevin Bobo said. Bobo said the man who shot Thompson has a valid concealed weapons permit, cooperated with investigators, and won’t be facing any charges. “Thompson was still on the scene when deputies arrived, but the initial scene was chaotic,” Bobo said. “It wasn’t until victims and witnesses were interviewed, and video from the scene was reviewed that Thompson was identified as the suspect.” Thompson was charged with four counts of attempted murder, possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, and unlawful carrying of a weapon. Websites advocating for gun rights like Freedom Outpost seized the story to make the case for concealed carry to protect crowds of people from active shooters, especially in crowded public places. These posts also claimed that the media had failed to report the shooting because of likely bias against 2nd Amendment rights and gun owners. But that’s not necessarily true. Various media outlets in the Carolinas covered the story, including the Charlotte Observer , WQAD 8 , GoUpState.com and KFOR . The Associated Press also picked up the story, which allowed national outlets like FOX News to publish the story online . Still, it’s true that most national media outlets didn’t report the story. So, it’s true that a concealed carrier stopped a man who opened fire on a group outside a nightclub in South Carolina. But claims that there was a media blackout are debatable. ","Crime - Police"
"Obama Signs Executive Order Banning Sale of Assault Rifles – Fiction!","2016-06-20 13:21:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-sale-assault-rifles/"," It’s been reported that President Obama has signed an executive order banning the sale of assault rifles in the aftermath of the Orlando terrorist attack. "," A fake news website is behind false reports that President Obama has taken executive action to ban the sale of assault rifles That story appeared at a fake news website that is mocked up to look like ABC News under the headline, “President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the Sale of Assault Weapons.” The story begins: WASHINGTON D.C. (AP) — After Sunday’s mass shooting in Orlando, which left 50 Americans dead and 53 wounded, President Obama decided to take unilateral action on gun control by signing Executive Order 13691. The new law bans all sales of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales, regardless of whether the transaction takes place at a gun dealership or gun show. The requirement also extends to private sales and requires all private firearm sellers to broker the sale through a federally licensed gun dealer. The order requires prospective gun buyers to undergo a psychological evaluation. Individuals who have been committed involuntarily to a mental health institution at any time; those who have been voluntarily committed with the past 5 years; anyone with a domestic violence restraining order, regardless of criminal history; and anyone who has been placed on the no-fly list or terrorist watch listat any time within the past 10 years will not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms. The story was widely circulated on social media, and the fake news website’s resemblance to ABC News tricked many into believing that report was true, but that’s not the case. The website uses a classic trick to scam readers into believing its an official ABC News website: a subtle “.co” is added to the end of ABC New’s official website URL, which is very easy to miss at first glance. If that wasn’t enough, the fake news story cites Executive Order 13691 as the one that the president signed to ban the sale of assault rifles — but a quick read of that executive order reveals that it’s not about assault rifles or any other guns. It’s about cybersecurity information sharing. President Obama did, however, sign an executive order related to gun violence into law in January — but it didn’t ban the sale of assault rifles or any other guns. Rather, the executive action stated that the ATF was finalizing a rule requiring a background check for all gun purchases, ordering federal prosecutors to focus on “smart enforcement” of gun laws, increasing mental health treatment and adding it to the background check system, and sponsoring gun safety technology. In the executive order, the president stated that he was committed to using “every tool at the Administration’s disposal” to reduce gun violence, but he noted that many problems could only be fixed through legislation: The President and Vice President are committed to using every tool at the Administration’s disposal to reduce gun violence. Some of the gaps in our country’s gun laws can only be fixed through legislation, which is why the President continues to call on Congress to pass the kind of commonsense gun safety reforms supported by a majority of the American people. And while Congress has repeatedly failed to take action and pass laws that would expand background checks and reduce gun violence, today, building on the significant steps that have already been taken over the past several years, the Administration is announcing a series of commonsense executive actions designed to: And Obama talked about making it harder for people who “want to kill Americans” to get their hands on assault riffles in his weekly radio address right before this fake news report went viral, but he didn’t announce any plans to ban the sale of assault rifles through executive order: Alongside the stories of bravery and healing and coming together over the past week, we’ve also seen a renewed focus on reducing gun violence.  As I said a few days ago, being tough on terrorism requires more than talk. Being tough on terrorism, particularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we’ve seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible .  That’s something I’ll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.

"," Claims about the sentences of Lee Carroll Brooker and Brock Turner are mostly true — but important details about Brooker’s sentence have been excluded. Shortly after Brock Turner was sentenced to six months in jail for the rape of an unconscious girl behind a dumpster, his sentence was compared to that of Lee Carroll Brooker on social media to argue the unfairness of Turner’s sentence. Viral posts state that Lee Carroll Brooker was given a “life sentence” for growing three marijuana plants and that Brock Turner was given just six months for rape. Those comparisons are mostly true — but outside factors contributed to Lee Carroll Brooker’s life sentence. He was previously convicted of two armed robberies in Florida and served 10 years in prison. In 2011, when he was arrested in Alabama for growing marijuana, the judge was forced to sentence him to life in prison because of Alabama laws pertaining to sentencing guidelines for convicted felons, the New York Times reports : Lee Carroll Brooker, a 75-year-old disabled veteran suffering from chronic pain, was arrested in July 2011 for growing three dozen marijuana plants for his own medicinal use behind his son’s house in Dothan, Ala., where he lived. For this crime, Mr. Brooker was given a life sentence with no possibility of release. Alabama law mandates that anyone with certain prior felony convictions be sentenced to life without parole for possessing more than 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of marijuana, regardless of intent to sell. Mr. Brooker had been convicted of armed robberies in Florida two decades earlier, for which he served 10 years. The marijuana plants collected at his son’s house — including unusable parts like vines and stalks — weighed 2.8 pounds. At his sentencing, the trial judge told Mr. Brooker that if he “could sentence you to a term that is less than life without parole, I would.” Last year, Roy Moore, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court,called Mr. Brooker’s sentence “excessive and unjustified,” and said it revealed “grave flaws” in the state’s sentencing laws, but the court still upheld the punishment. That’s not to say that the sentences of either Lee Carroll Brooker or Brock Turner were fair. However, Brooker’s sentence was handed down in light of his previous felony convictions in addition to growing marijuana. That’s why we’re calling this one “mostly truth.” ","Crime - Police"

"," Mary Ann Carlson didn’t say that gun owners are likely to commit a crime, or that gun registration should be used to arrest people before they commit crimes. Mary Ann Carlson was, however, defeated in a Vermont state senate race in the mid 1990s after introducing gun control legislation that would have established a gun registry and a wait period for buying handguns. Mary Ann Carlson’s supposed quote appeared in a long list of quotes from lawmakers about taking guns away from people that was posted at the pro-gun website The Truth About Guns in July 2014. The list attacked the argument that “nobody wants to take your guns away” by listing quotes from lawmakers who supposedly want to just that. Among them was Mary Ann Carlson, a former Democratic state senator from Vermont: Vermont State Mary Ann Carlson (D) does. “We must be able to arrest people before they commit crimes. By registering guns and knowing who has them we can do that. If they have guns they are pretty likely to commit a crime.” From there, the Mary Ann Carlson’s gun control quote made its way to a Reddit discussion forum , where people commented that Mary Ann Carlson had lost her seat in the Vermont State Senate over the comment or because she introduced gun control legislation, which have been common claims over the years. And Mary Ann Carlson’s alleged quote about arresting criminals before they commit crimes isn’t new — it’s been making the rounds since at least 2002 . Let’s start with what’s true about this rumor. Mary Ann Carlson lost her seat in the Vermont Senate in the mid-1990s after introducing a number of gun control bills (it’s been falsely reported that Mary Ann Carlson lost her senate seat as recently as 2014). In an interview with the New Haven Register in 2013, Carlson said her stance on gun control likely contributed to her defeat: Mary Ann Carlson, a former Democratic senator from Bennington County, said she experienced the backlash of Vermont’s strong gun culture after introducing legislation in 1994 that would have restricted semi-automatic weapons and required gun registration in Vermont. Carlson was defeated in the ensuing election and said her bill played a role in that defeat. “I think probably the NRA came after me,” she said. “There was a bumper sticker out that said, ‘guns and ammo yes, Carlson no.'”Carlson and other sponsors were looking to keep firearms out of the hands of people who should not own them, she said. She still believes that “many incredible people who have guns use them responsibly” and those responsible gun owners could help create restrictions that would prevent gun violence. “I wish that the … people who use guns responsibly would speak out so people who use guns irresponsibly can’t just go out and buy a gun and the next day use it,” Carlson said. As for her supposed quotes about arresting criminals before they commit crimes, or about all gun owners being criminals, we couldn’t find any record of her actually saying those things. Mary Ann Carlson also directly denied making those remarks on a local Vermont blog back in 2003, stating that she was a supporter of civil liberties and that the quotes didn’t jibe with her beliefs. So, given that Mary Ann Carlson apparently lost her senate seat after introducing gun control bills, and because there’s no record of her making the quotes that have been attributed to her, we’re labeling this one truth and fiction.

So don’t bother! After several Knocks, they finally left. I glanced and could see it was a man through the stained glass of my door. After about 30 minutes I walked outside to look for what I thought would be a brochure, but instead found a rubber band around my knob to hold the door to open when I unlocked the latch. I called Ron and he told me to get the gun out and leave it out.

Some who commented why the would-be burglar would have left the rubber band on the door after nobody answered. Others questioned whether a rubber band on a door latch would actually prevent a lock from latching (a woman who said she worked in the door hardware industry said it would, if the rubber band applied enough pressure). We can’t verify whether or not this would work, but we weren’t able to find any instances of this happening (including near Tatum, Texas, where the woman who posted the warning lives). So, given that we aren’t able to confirm that burglars are actually trying to use rubber bands to break into houses, we’re calling this one unverified.","Crime - Police"

This photo actually does show a prison and judicial center, but it’s not located in the United States. Built in Styria Austria in 2004, Justice Center Leoben holds about 200 inmates: The New York Times published a story about “five star prisons” in 2009 that explored the idea of using architectural concepts at prisons in Europe to inspire change in inmates. The article even mentions how Leoben has been misidentified in emails as the new Cook County Correctional Center: Leoben has received quite a lot of attention. In America, its public profile has been limited to a series of get-a-load-of-this e-mail messages and mocking blog posts (where the prison is often misidentified as a corrections center outside Chicago), but in Europe, Hohensinn’s design has become more of a model — not universally accepted, but not easily ignored either. It is the opening statement in a debate about what it means to construct a better prison. Already there are plans to build something like it outside of Berlin. It’s not clear how or why these photos were misidentified in the viral emails.

"," Accounts of Evan Tweed’s spring break nightmare in Mexico appear to be true. The story first appeared at the website of online newspaper Sun This Week under the headline, “Spring Break Nightmare in Mexico.” The story recounts how Evan Tweed was arrested and thrown in a Mexican jail during an altercation in a nightclub while on vacation with his family. Tweed said security guards quickly surrounded him after an altercation broke out and later turned him over to Mexican police. That first report was short of important details like what the altercation was about, and what Tweed had been accused of. However, a local CBS News affiliate in Minnesota picked up the story and filled in some of those details. As it turns out, a woman accused Tweed of punching her during an altercation at a bar: “Our deal is to have a week in the sun and a nice big vacation with a lot of people that we knew and that was our intent, and it went sour,” Tweed said. That’s putting it lightly. It started nicely.  But as a group of parents went out for an after dinner drink at one of their resort’s bars  a scuffle broke out, a woman claimed Tweed punched her in the face. His friends say he never touched anyone. “The scene was chaotic, a lot of people were screaming and yelling,” Durst said. Tweed says hotel security, “Got physical, threw me down, put a knee in my back, handcuffed me.” Then things got more intense. They turned him over to the Mexican police, took him away, cuffed and under an armed guard. Tweed was booked into jail and said that he came across a woman from Eagan, Minnesota, who was also unsure why she had been arrested. A friend of Tweed’s paid the police $180 each for the release of Tweed and the Eagan woman the next day. Tweed has typed up a full, five-page account of his spring break nightmare in Mexico. You can read his entire account here . And, while we’re reporting this one as truth, it’s important to note that we’ve only heard one side of the story.

"11 States Agree to Motorcycle Curfew-Fiction!","2016-03-07 13:59:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/11-states-agree-motorcycle-curfew/"," Eleven states have agreed to implement a motorcycle curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. at the request of the Department of Transportation. "," Rumors about a motorcycle curfew are totally false. They can be traced back to a story published at Associated Media Coverage under the headline, “11 States Agree to Implement And Enforce Motorcycle Curfew.” The Department of Transportation supposedly “placed pressure” on the states to adopt an “ordinance” that restricts motorcycle use from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., the story reports : The U.S Department of Transportation who admittedly placed pressure on state representatives to implement the ordinance within their respective states are hopeful that representatives across the country will take notice and agree to implement and enforce the curfew within their states by late 2016. According to U.S Department Transportation representative Donald McCarthy, the ordinance was born out of a necessity. According to statistics published on the U.D.O.Twebsite, approximately 7,342  motorcyclist fatalities occurred across the country throughout 2015. This is an almost 20% increase to the 6,120 fatalities reported in 2015. The statistics found on the U.D.O.T website indicate that roughly 47% of motorcyclist fatalities in both 2014 and 2015 reportedly occurred during the hours of 10:30 PM – 4:45 AM. Little is known about Associated Media Coverage . The site had only published a handful of stories when the report about a motorcycle curfew went viral in March 2016. The site doesn’t identify itself as satire or fake news, but the story is pretty easy to prove false. First, state legislatures don’t adopt ordinances , as the story claims. Only city or town governments adopt ordinances. State governments adopt statutes. That’s the first clue that this story is bogus. Second, there’s nothing about a new motorcycle curfew posted on the Department of Transportations website, and there surely would be if the story was true. Third, the motorcycle lobby hasn’t raised a ruckus over the so-called motorcycle curfew, and neither have rider groups. Given the fact that this story gets key details of the lawmaking process wrong (ordinances vs. statutes), and that there’s no other mention of a so-called motorcycle curfew anywhere on the web outside of this story, we’re calling this one false.

"Michigan Just Made Sodomy a Felony Offense-Mostly Fiction!","2016-02-09 11:48:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michigan-makes-sodomy-a-felony-offense-mostly-fiction/"," Social media has been abuzz with reports that new animal cruelty laws make sodomy a crime in Michigan. "," Reports that Michigan “just” made sodomy a felony are false. But there is a kernel truth hidden in the rumor. The Michigan State Senate updated a section of penal code on animal cruelty in January. An old, unenforceable provision making sodomy a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison was left intact. Section 158 of the law , which has been on the books since 1931, states that: Because the provision was left in the amended penal code, rumors quickly spread across social media sites that Michigan had “just” made sodomy illegal. While it’s understandable for some to draw that conclusion based on the information provided, it’s false. First, Michigan’s animal cruelty law (and the part that allegedly made sodomy a crime) have been on the books since the 1930s. Second, a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling made in unconstitutional for states to enforce such laws. The Supreme Court found that a Texas law criminalizing gay sex amounted to an unconstitutional violation of privacy. The high court struck it, and all similar laws across the country, down. In the court’s ruling , Justice Kennedy wrote, “The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.” By 2014, however, 12 states still had anti-sodomy laws on the books: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. In 2011, police in Louisiana arrested gay men for “attempted crimes against nature using the anti-sodomy law in a sting operation that caused a national outcry,” USA Today reports . In that case, however, the district attorney called the statute “unenforceable” and refused to bring charges. When it comes to Michigan’s law, it seems the provision was left in place to avoid public debate on the provision. State Sen. Rick Jones, the author of the state’s animal cruelty bill, explained that the the anti-sodomy statute was left in place because he wanted the law to pass, and he wanted to avoid the controversy that would have resulted: “The minute I cross that line and I start talking about the other stuff, I won’t even get another hearing. It’ll be done. Nobody wants to touch it. I would rather not even bring up the topic, because I know what would happen. You’d get both sides screaming and you end up with a big fight that’s not needed because it’s unconstitutional. But if you focus on it, people just go ballistic. If we could put a bill in that said anything that’s unconstitutional be removed from the legal books of Michigan, that’s probably something I could vote for, but am I going to mess up this dog bill that everybody wants? No.” So, it’s true that an old, outdated anti-sodomy law was left on the books when Michigan’s animal cruelty statutes were updated. But reports that Michigan has passed a “new” anti-sodomy law, or plans to enforce the old law, are false. ","Crime - Police"
"Places Not to Go if You Want to Stay Alive-Mostly Fiction!","2016-01-15 09:44:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/places-not-to-go-if-you-want-to-stay-alive/"," A chain email lists the murder rates of 109 countries and makes the argument that all of them have “100% gun bans” and are far less safe than America. "," The murder rates of various countries listed in this email were probably accurate at one time, but many of them have since changed. And the claim that the 109 countries listed have “100% gun bans” is false in most cases, which is why we’re calling this one “mostly fiction.” First, let’s start with claims about murder rates. We’re not going to verify the murder rate of all 109 countries listed, but a look at the top five countries shows that data cited in the email is outdated. In some case, murder rates have gone up, and in other cases murder rates have gone down. The World Heath Organization reported in 2014 that the murder rate in Honduras was 103.9 per 100,000 people, even more than the 91.6 reported in the email. The murder rate in El Salvador, however, was 43.9 per 100,000, far less than the 69.2 cited in the email. Murder rates in the other top five countries were both higher and lower than reported. In El Salvador, the murder rate had dropped to 41.7 per 100,000 (not 91.6, as reported in the email). Similarly, the murder rate in Cote d’Ivoire, which has been embroiled in civil war within the last five years, was 12.2 per 100,000 (not 56.9, as reported). The murder rate of Jamaica (45.1) was down slightly, while the murder rate Venezuela (57.6) was up significantly. So, the data cited in the email is generally outdated. And when it comes to the claim that all of the 109 countries listed have “100% gun bans,” this email jumps the rails and heads into pure fiction. Civilians in Honduras, for example, are allowed to own up to five guns. In 2013, there were 850,000 firearms officially registered in the country, and officials said they believed that was only 23% of the total civilian-owned guns in the country. According to the Small Arms Survey: The most popular firearms in Honduras are 9 mm handguns, which can be legally purchased and owned. These weapons are banned for civilian use in nearby Mexico, thus creating a regulatory imbalance that encourages illicit weapons flows between the two countries. For its part, Venezuela has expanded restrictions on carrying guns in public places, and it banned the commercial sale of guns in 2012. Still, legislation passed a short time later allowed for the re-opening of gun shops. El Salvador, meanwhile, has strict gun laws, but not an absolute ban. You must apply for licenses with local authorities to possess and carry guns. Cote d’Ivoire, commonly known as the Ivory Coast, is a different scenario. The high murder rate cited in the email was likely fallout from a civil war there that left 3,000 people dead in 2011. Human Rights Watch reports that gun control measures there have since focused on disarming former combatants and returning security functions from the military to the police. And there are strong gun laws in Jamaica, but firearms aren’t 100% banned there, either. The Firearms Act of 1967 required that all guns be licensed with an annual registration fee of $6,000 Jamaican dollars. All gun crimes committed there are tried through a special Gun Court that was established in 1975. A quick look at gun laws in the countries with the highest murder rates listed in the email proves that none of them have “100% gun bans,” as it claims. That’s why we’re calling that claim fiction.

"California Gun Law Takes Effect January 2016, Guns to be Confiscated Without Notice- Truth! & Fiction!","2015-12-30 09:33:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/california-gun-law-takes-effect-in-january-2016-guns-could-be-confiscated-without-notice/"," A new gun law taking effect in California on January 1, 2016, will allow police to seize guns without prior notice. "," Viral rumors about a California gun law taking effect on January 1, 2016, are both truth and fiction. It’s true that a California gun law that goes into effect in January will allow police to seize guns from their owners for up to 21 days if a court agrees that a gun owner is a threat to themselves or others. But reports that President Obama is behind the effort are untrue. Reports that guns could be taken without notice are also untrue, contrary to reports by Breitbart and other outlets. And the new gun violence restraining order bill ( Assembly Bill 1014 ) has commonly been confused with California’s Armed & Prohibited Persons System (APPS) , which has been on the books since 2001. First, let’s take a look at the gun violence retraining order bill that takes effect on January 1, 2016. Under the bill, a court would be able to issue a “temporary emergency gun violence restraining order” if a law enforcement official asserts that there’s reasonable cause to believe a person poses an “immediate and present danger” to themselves or others. As written, the law would require that written notice of the order be served to the gun owner: The bill would require a law enforcement officer to serve the order on the restrained person, if the restrained person can reasonably be located, file a copy of the order with the court, and have the order entered into the computer database system for protective and restraining orders maintained by the Department of Justice. The bill would require the presiding judge of the superior court of each county to designate at least one judge, commissioner, or referee who is required to be reasonably available to issue temporary emergency gun violence restraining orders when the court is not in session. This bill would additionally authorize a court to issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order prohibiting the subject of the petition from having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive, a firearm or ammunition when it is shown that there is a substantial likelihood that the subject of the petition poses a significant danger of harm to himself, herself, or another in the near future by having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm and that the order is necessary to prevent personal injury to himself, herself, or another, as specified. The bill would require the ex parte order to expire no later than 21 days after the date on the order and would require the court to hold a hearing within 21 days of issuing the ex parte gun violence restraining order to determine if a gun violence restraining order that is in effect for one year should be issued. The bill would require a law enforcement officer or a person at least 18 years of age who is not a party to the action to personally serve the restrained person the ex parte order, if the restrained person can reasonably be located. If a gun owner refused to surrender his weapons and ammunition voluntarily, law enforcement officials would execute a search warrant to confiscate the weapons. Then, if the gun owner were to break the temporary restraining order, he would be subject to a misdemeanor and a weapons and ammunition ban of up to five years. The law was passed in 2014 in response to gunman Elliot Rodger’s mass shooting in Santa Barbara that left six dead and 14 wounded. In the days leading up to the rampage, Rodger’s parents had contacted law enforcement a number of times to conduct well being and mental health checks of their son after he posted disturbing videos on YouTube, according to a sheriff’s department report . Officers didn’t find that Rodger met the criteria for involuntary mental health confinement, and released him. The stated goal of the emergency gun violence retraining order law is to give police and family members an opportunity to temporarily separate people like Rodger from their weapons when they pose an imminent threat. Some right-wing media outlets have portrayed the law as an attempt by President Obama to start confiscating weapons, or an opportunity for police to take weapons “without notice.” Both are untrue. The California Legislature, not the federal government or President Obama passed the law. And police are required to give notice of emergency gun violence temporary restraining orders so that weapons and ammunition can (hopefully) be voluntarily surrounded. Also, ahead of the new gun law, old reports about California’s Amerced and Prohibited Persons System (APPS) have floated to the surface. That’s led to some confusion about the scope of law taking effect on January 1. APPS cross references databases of individuals who have legally purchased handguns and registered assault weapons since 1996 with those who are prohibited from owning weapons. The state prohibits felons, the mentally ill and some convicted of domestic violence from owning guns. The purpose of APPS is to identify those who illegally own or possess guns under the law so they can be confiscated. So, as is often the case with claims about gun laws and gun ownership, this rumor is a combination of truth and fiction. ","Crime - Police"

"," Claims that 17 gang members burned a white girl alive and that the media has ignored the story are both off base. The rumors started with right-wing websites like Before Its News and Right Wing News reported on December 19, 2015. With headlines like, “17 Black Gang Banger Burned a White Girl Alive … Where Is Obama?” those websites tried to use the story of white teenager who was burned alive to prove that “White Life doesn’t mean @#%!” to President Obama and the mainstream media. Those reports get a few key details wrong, however. For starters, the gang members weren’t arrested in connection with the teen’s murder, which is an important detail. But before we get into that, let’s take a look at the story’s background. Nineteen-year-old Jessica Chambers was found burned to death in Courtland, Mississippi, just after 8 p.m. on December 6, 2014. Authorities say she had been doused in gasoline and set on fire while she sat in her car. Mainstream media outlets like CBS , FOX , NBC and CNN have covered the story extensively. The FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Chambers’ murder and described the investigation as such: Since the discovery of this brutal crime, multiple state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a collaborative investigative effort to identify the person or persons responsible for Jessica’s death. Significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation, and additional rewards have been offered for information relevant to this case. “We continue to solicit the public’s assistance in solving this heinous crime,” stated FBI Special Agent in Charge Donald Alway. “With the public’s help, we are confident that information will be uncovered which will lead to the arrest and successful prosecution of the individual or individuals who cruelly and brutally attacked and killed Jessica Chambers.” Then, on December 18, 2015, news broke that 17 people had been arrested in an operation targeting suspected gang members called “Operation Bite Back.” FBI Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said that the arrests were “a byproduct” of Jessica Chambers’ death investigation — but the arrests were not directly related to Chambers’ death, the local paper reports : Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said Tuesday’s arrests are not directly related to Chambers’ death but to information gathered as authorities have interviewed more than 150 people and sorted through more than 20,000 phone records trying to find her killer. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said as the FBI assisted state and local investigators, suspected illegal activity came to light and resulted in the indictments and arrests Tuesday morning. The indictments in both the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and Mississippi’s 17th Circuit Court District charge the 17 suspects on a variety of violations ranging from child endangerment, possession of stolen firearms, narcotics sales and felon in possession of a firearm to possession of counterfeit currency. It’s not clear how Jessica Chambers’ death investigation led to such a large-scale gang bust, or if authorities suspected any of the gang members of taking part in her murder. So, reports that claim gang members murdered Jessica Chambers are false. And claims that Obama and the media have ignored those reports are false because the FBI hadn’t connected Chambers’ death to the alleged gang members. ","Crime - Police"
"Anti-gun Senator Shoots Intruder-Mostly Fiction!","2015-12-15 08:10:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/anti-gun-senator-shoots-intruder/"," It’s been reported that R.C. Soles, a former anti-gun senator from North Carolina, shot an intruder in his home. "," Former North Carolina State Sen. R.C. Soles shot an intruder at his North Carolina home in 2009, but the claim that Soles was an “anti-gun senator” doesn’t check out. The shooting unfolded at R.C. Soles’ home in Tabor City, North Carolina, in August 2009. Soles told police that two former clients of his law firm were trespassing on his property, and that he shot one of the men in the leg as he tried to break Soles’ door down. State investigators said that R.C. Soles had “acted unlawfully” in the shooting, and a grand jury agreed. A grand jury indicted Soles for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. Soles pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2010 and paid a $1,000 fine for the offense. Interestingly, that wasn’t Soles’ only run-in with a former client of his law firm. He was also charged with assault with a deadly weapon in 2012 for allegedly hitting another former client in the face with a metal walking cane, but he was found not guilty in that case. The idea that an anti-gun senator had shot an intruder started with a 2011 post on a Field & Stream community page . The commenter said that Soles, a Democrat and the longest serving North Carolina senator at the time, acted hypocritically because he had “made a career of being against gun ownership” and then used a gun in his own defense: The Senator, who has made a career of being against gun ownership for the general public, didn’t hesitate to defend himself with his own gun when he believed he was in immediate danger and he was the victim. In typical hypocritical liberal fashion, the “Do as I say and not as I do” Anti-Gun Activist Lawmaker picked up his gun and took action in what apparently was a self-defense shooting. Why hypocritical you may ask? It is because his long legislative record shows that the actions that he took to protect his family, his own response to a dangerous life threatening situation, are actions that he feels ordinary citizens should not have if they were faced with an identical situation. It has prompted some to ask if the Senator believes his life and personal safety is more valuable than yours or mine. But, this is to be expected from those who believe they can run our lives, raise our kids, and protect our families better than we can. The post is wrong on several fronts. First, R.C. Soles himself admitted in pleading guilty that he had not “acted in self defense.” Second, Soles hadn’t “made a career of being against gun ownership” before the shooting, either. The National Rifle Association gave Soles just one rating below a B+ for his gun-friendly views in the North Carolina State Senate from 1996-2008, according to VoteSmart.org . Grass Roots North Carolina, a non-profit dedicated to gun rights, gave R.C. Soles a lower favorability rating on gun rights between 1996 and 2008. That group rated Soles’ support of pro-gun legislation at 80%, 63%, 63%, 20%, 64% and 68%. So, it’s clear that Soles’ rating was from a local pro-gun group was lower than the NRA’s rating — but it’s not accurate to say that Soles had “made a career” of being against gun ownership based on his record, as has been claimed. Rumors about the so-called anti-gun senator who shot an intruder have cropped up a number of times since 2009. In 2013, the original Field & Stream post appeared on a FOX News community blog as a “flash back,” and that rekindled the story. In 2015, the story was re-reported on a blog site called Wizbang . That report made it appear that the tale of an anti-gun senator who shot an intruder was a new one, and the report repeated outdated and incorrect claims about the situation. So, although R.C. Soles did shoot an intruder back in 2009, we’re calling the claim that an anti-gun senator shot an intruder “mostly fiction.” Soles voting record just doesn’t support the claim that he was an “anti-gun senator.” ","Crime - Police"
"Homeless Couple, Meth Lab Found in Walmart Attic-Fiction!","2015-12-07 09:29:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/homeless-couple-meth-lab-found-in-walmart-attic/"," It’s been reported that a homeless couple was found living in a Walmart attic with a meth lab, hot plate and flat screen television.

The fake news website, Now 8 News, reported on December 1, 2015, that a homeless couple was found “living in the lap of luxury” in the attic of Walmart store in Memphis, Tennessee: Memphis, Tennessee –  Being homeless has to be very difficult, especially in the colder times of the year. But not for this Tennessee couple who had been “living in the lap of luxury” above a Tennessee Walmart store. The ‘homeless’ man, 48-year-old Wilbert Thomas, admitted to police that he and his girlfriend 54-year-old Ingrid Malone, had been living above the store for over two years. What they did to the attic, baffled police Within days, the fake news story had been shared hundreds of thousands of times on social media networks. Taken out of context, many people who stumbled onto the story on social media sites were duped into believing it was real, but that’s not the case. Now 8 News is one of many fake news sites that is designed to look like local television news stations. The website doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake or satirical news website, so readers often mistake its fictional reports for actual news. Still, the idea of a person found to be living in a retail store isn’t very far fetched. In 2014, a teenager was found living in a Walmart store in Dallas. The teen made two secret campsites in the store and periodically changed his clothes to avoid being noticed. Store employees eventually noticed a “trail of trash” left by the teen, and he was taken “licensed professionals for follow up care,” CBS News reports . ","Crime - Police"
"There Have Been 352 Mass Shootings in 336 Days-Disputed!","2015-12-03 14:21:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/there-have-been-352-mass-shootings-in-336-days/"," There are reports that there had been 352 mass shootings in the U.S. by December 2015, more mass shootings than days in the year so far. "," Claims about the number of mass shootings reported in the U.S. vary because the definition of “mass shooting” is disputed. After Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik allegedly murdered 14 people and injured 21 in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, reports spread across social media that there had been 352 mass shootings in the first 336 days of 2015, more mass shootings than days. That figure comes from ShootingTracker.com , a reddit community project that collects and archives reports of shootings in the U.S. The group defines “mass shooting” as one in which at least four people are injured. Various government agencies define mass shootings differently. The FBI doesn’t have a specific definition for “mass shooting.” It defined a “mass killing” as one with at least three fatalities in a 2014 report on active shooters . The FBI defines “mass murder” as one in which at least four people are killed at one time. The Congressional Research Service defined “mass shooting” as one in which at least four people are killed with a gun, meeting the FBI’s definition of “mass murder,” according to a report released in July 2015 . Brock Weller, a co-founder of ShootingTracker.com, explained that the group defines a mass shooting as one in which four people are injured — not killed — because it would be “absurd” not to call 18 people being shot a mass shooting. In an interview with The Trace, a nonprofit that focuses on coverage of guns in the media, Weller explained : “The goal is to stop minimizing these acts of violence,” Weller explains. The site’s authors point to a 2012 shooting in which one person was killed and 18 people were wounded at a nightclub. Because only one person died, it was not considered a mass shooting. This June, 10 people were shot at a block party on a basketball court in Detroit; the next day, 11 were wounded when two people opened fire with a shotgun at a block party in West Philadelphia. Neither were widely referred to as mass shootings. “Arguing that 18 people shot during one event is not a mass shooting is absurd,” the Tracker’s founders write. Medical advancements have helped save lives that would have otherwise been lost, a fact Weller believes the gun lobby benefits from. “Those gunshot victims are still just as shot and will never be the same,” he says. So, using ShootingTracker.com’s definition for mass shootings, there had been 352 mass shootings by early December, an average of more than one mass shooting per day at that point. Using the Congressional Research Service definition for mass shootings, however, there had been far fewer than 352 mass shootings. That’s why we’re classifying this one as disputed.

"Walmart Check for Quality Control Program-Scam!","2015-12-01 12:19:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/walmart-check-for-quality-control-program-scam/"," People are receiving what appear to be Walmart checks and letters inviting them to participate in the Walmart Quality Control Program as secret shoppers. "," If you’ve received a Walmart check in the mail, it’s a scam. People have reported receiving what appears to be a check from Walmart for $1,992 in the mail for their participation in the Walmart Quality Control Program: A letter states that the person receiving the check has been hired as a part-time Consumer Survey and quality control specialist, and that the enclosed Walmart check is to complete an initial training exercise: This is to inform you that based on the previous survey by our affiliate Customer Survey and Quality Control Specialists, you indicated your interest in an additional income on a part time basis, you hereby selected to participated in a paid Quality Control Program as one of the research personnel selected under the program, you will be working as a Consumer Service Evaluator of some selected merchant outlets and service providers. This research program is a fully paid program and would be become a permanent part time position for a selected few who are able to distinguish themselves in the course of this program. You will be assigned different jobs every week, for each job assignment, you will get paid different salary depending on the nature of the job assigned. Upon accepting this offer, you must keep your identity and assignment as CONFIDENTIAL in order not to introduce any form of bias to the data you collect. There is no obligation as to how long you eep the job, you are allowed to quit whenever you want. According to the scam, the $1,992 Walmart check enclosed needs to be activated by logging onto wmnewtalents.com and entering a user ID and activation code that has been included in the letter. Then, once the check has been activated, the victim is instructed to deposit the check into a personal bank account — but that’s a bad idea. Once the fake Walmart check is “deposited” into your bank account, scammers will drain all of your funds. That’s what happened to a number of victims in Illinois, according to a warning from a local sheriff’s office . Walmart has also issued a fraud alert for what it has dubbed “a mystery shopper scam.” Mystery shoppers (also called secret shoppers) are paid to shop so that they can report their experiences back to corporate headquarters. Walmart has said that it does not authorize or use mystery shopper programs, so any offers to participate in them are scams: How these scams work • The scam artist sends a letter, e-mail solicitation or places an ad in a newspaper or on an electronic message board describing a paid, stay-at-home position in which the consumer will evaluate customer service at large retail stores—businesses with familiar names. In reality, these stores have no affiliation with the scam artist placing the ad. • After responding to the ad, the consumer receives an “employment packet” containing a training assignment, a list of products to purchase at different stores and a realistic-looking cashier’s check, often for $2,000 to $4,000. • The “training assignment” is to deposit the check into the consumer’s bank account, pose as a shopper and then use wire transfer to send the balance of the check’s proceeds (minus the cost of the purchases and the consumer’s “salary”) to an address outside the United States, often in Canada. The problem is that the check is fake; so when it bounces—which occurs after the money is wired—the consumer is accountable (in some cases, criminally) to the bank for the entire amount of the fake check, plus additional penalty fees. Also, in some instances, consumers are asked for personal bank account information. The company will then “deposit” money into their account for payment and funds with which to perform their Secret Shopper tasks. These consumers often then become victims of identity theft or have their accounts drained by fraudster.

"Family of Clock Kid Ahmed Mohamed Sues for $15 Million-Truth!","2015-11-24 10:57:58","https://www.truthorfiction.com/family-of-ahmed-mohamed-sues-for-15-million/"," The family of Ahmed Mohamed, the Muslim teenager who was arrested and suspended from a school in Texas for bringing a home made clock to school, has sued the city of Irving and the school district for $15 million. "," It’s true that the family of Ahmed Mohamed plans to file a $15 million lawsuit over the teenager being arrested and suspended for brining a homemade clock to school. A lawyer representing Ahmed Mohamed, also known as the “clock kid,” announced the family’s plan to file a $15 million lawsuit on November 23, 2015. A letter of demand alleges that school officials never thought Ahmed Mohamed’s homemade clock was a bomb and forced him to sign a letter of confession, the Washington Post reports : Attorneys claim that Ahmed showed it to another teacher earlier in the day without consequence. But in his English class, a teacher told him it “looked like” a bomb. “The basis for Ms. West’s actions is unclear. She certainly did not treat the clock as though it were dangerous. Ms. West initially placed the clock on her desk,” the letter states. Ahmed was escorted out of class and taken to a room where five Irving Police Department officers, the principal and assistant principal performed an “interrogation,” attorneys said. He was not permitted to contact his parents and was “pressured to sign a written statement admitting that he intended to bring a ‘hoax bomb’ to school.” The letter states that the principal threatened that he would be expelled if he did not sign the confession. News of Ahmed Mohamed’s arrest and suspension for bringing a homemade clock to school sparked a national controversy over religious discrimination. Although Ahmed Mohamed was not charged for brining the homemade clock to school, he was suspended because, school officials said, he had brought a “suspicious looking item” to school. In appearance on the Glenn Beck’s The Blaze radio show, Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne said that Ahmed Mohamed told the media more about the homemade clock than he told police and school officials who were trying to ensure the safety of kids in the school: We’ve heard more from the media than the child ever released to the police when we were asking him questions. He told a lot more to the reporters than he ever told to the police. There’s a problem with that. If your child was in that school and you saw something like this come in, you would want to make sure it is our priority to make our children safe in school, period. Irving is the fifth safest city in the country. We’re pretty very proud of that fact. We have a very professional police department. I’m very proud of them. What has happened as a result of the hashtag of the misinformation that has been spread like wildfire immediately by the president is we now have death threats on members of our police department and in our school district. For what? After Ahmed Mohamed was arrested and suspended, he was invited to an “Astronomy Night” event at the White House. Then, the family accepted an invitation for Mohamed to attend a private school in Qatar free of charge and relocated there. The family’s attorney later said the family would like to return to Texas: “Qatar is nice, but it is not Texas. That is their attitude toward this,” Hollingsworth said. “They are citizens of Irving, Texas, USA, first. Are they devout people devoted to their faith? Absolutely. But they are Texans, too, and they want to come home. What we are seeking is for them to be able to do that with their heads held high.” So, it’s true that a lawyer has announced that Ahmed Mohamed plans to file a $15 million lawsuit against Irving and the school district.

"Dorothy Bland Made Up Allegations that White Officers Stopped Her for Walking While Black-Disputed!","2015-11-03 12:17:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dorothy-bland-made-up-allegations-that-white-officers-stopped-her-for-walking-while-black/"," Dorothy Bland, the dean of journalism at the University of North Texas, fabricated allegations that white police officers stopped her for “walking her while black” in her own neighborhood. "," It’s not clear whether Dorothy Bland was stopped for “walking while black” in her own neighborhood — or if Bland “fabricated” a rumor that she was. We do know that Dorothy Bland, a black woman and the dean of journalism at the University of North Texas, was stopped by two white police officers while walking in her residential neighborhood in Corinth, Texas, in October 2015. Corinth Police released dash camera video that shows a squad car following Dorothy Bland as she walked down a residential street flapping her arms. In the video, Bland eventually stops and two white police officers got out of the car and talk to her for about three minutes before she turns and leaves: After the exchange, Dorothy Bland wrote that she had been stopped for “walking while black” in her own neighborhood in an op-ed piece published by the Dallas Morning News : Knowing that the police officers are typically armed with guns and are a lot bigger than my 5 feet, 4 inches, I had no interest in my life’s story playing out like Trayvon Martin’s death. I stopped and asked the two officers if there was a problem; I don’t remember getting a decent answer before one of the officers asked me where I lived and for identification. I remember saying something like, “Around the corner. This is my neighborhood, and I’m a taxpayer who pays a lot of taxes.” As for the I.D. question, how many Americans typically carry I.D. with them on their morning walk? Do you realize I bought the hoodie I was wearing after completing the Harvard University Institute for Management and Leadership in Education in 2014? Do you realize I have hosted gatherings for family, friends, faculty, staff and students in my home? Not once was a police officer called. To those officers, my education or property-owner status didn’t matter. One officer captured my address and date of birth. I guess I was simply a brown face in an affluent neighborhood. I told the police I didn’t like to walk in the rain, and one of them told me, “My dog doesn’t like to walk in the rain.” Ouch! I didn’t have my I.D., but I did have my iPhone, so I took a picture of the two police officers and the Texas license plate. One of the officers told me I should walk on the sidewalk or the other side of the street for safety’s sake. In a written response , Corinth Police Chief Debra Walthall said that the encounter between Dorothy Bland and the two police officers was about resident’s safety, not race. Walthall said Bland was stopped for obstructing traffic, which is a misdemeanor offense: The driver of the truck looked at the officers as they passed and held his hands in the air, which implied “aren’t you going to do something about this?” The officers turned around and drove behind Ms. Bland. They activated their in-car video camera, which shows her again walking in the roadway impeding traffic. They activated their emergency lights — no siren was ever sounded — they exited their patrol vehicle and contacted Ms. Bland. They immediately advised Ms. Bland about the pickup truck and the fact that it was safer for her to walk against traffic so she could see the cars and jump out of the way if necessary. The interaction between Ms. Bland and the officers was very cordial and brief. Ms. Bland had been observed earlier by these same officers, but she was not in the street and impeding traffic, so she was not contacted. Impeding traffic is a Class C misdemeanor, and it is our policy to ask for identification from people we encounter for this type violation. I am surprised by her comments as this was not a confrontational encounter but a display of professionalism and genuine concern for her safety. After Corinth Police released the dash camera video of Dorothy Bland’s encounter with the police officers, reports began to swirl that Bland had “fabricated” that she was stopped for “walking while black.” It’s impossible to tell from the dash camera video whether or not Dorothy Bland’s race played a role in her exchange with police — but she was walking in a lane of traffic and appeared to be unaware that a squad car was following her for a block or two. James Ragland, a columnist for the Dallas Morning News, wrote that the exchange between Dorothy Bland and the officers demonstrated “broken trust” after high-profile cases involving Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner and others: But here’s the rub: Dorothy Bland, like every other black American not living under a rock, is fully aware of each of those encounters, all of which ended tragically. And that, unfortunately, is the shaky ground upon which this house of broken trust rests. That, plus the long history of police being perceived in poor black neighborhoods as instruments of white-power control and suppression. Yes, black folks are on edge. Many are quick to question every single move an officer makes: Is it fair? Would he have treated me like that if I were white? This is putting police in an untenable position. Legions of good cops repeatedly are paying for the sins or questionable behaviors of a few. That dynamic must change. Each of us bears the responsibility of making sure it does. It comes with a price. It necessitates a different mindset, and a change of heart. It will require us to at least give the men and women sworn to protect and serve the benefit of the doubt, especially in run-of-the-mill situations, which is what the Dorothy Bland drill looked like to me. But this new contract also obligates us to hold accountable officers who violate the public’s trust, whether that involves excessive force or illegal stops and searches. So, there’s no definitive proof of whether or not race played a role in Dorothy Bland’s exchange with police. There’s also no proof that Dorothy Bland intentionally fabricated her account of the exchange. That’s why we’ve classified this one as disputed. ","Crime - Police"

"," There’s been no indication that Chris Harper Mercer was motivated by Islamist terrorism to murder 10 people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Those rumors surfaced shortly after authorities identified Chris Harper-Mercer as the gunman in the mass murder. It has since been reported that Harper-Mercer wasn’t affiliated with any religion and was opposed to the concept of organized religion, however. Shortly after the mass shooting, the conservative blogger Charles C. Johnson published a report headlined, “Confirmed: Chris Harper-Mercer is 26 Year-old Muslim Killer.” The report, which had been shared nearly 70,000 times on Facebook, supposedly linked Harper-Mercer to Islamist terrorism through a MySpace profile that he had created. After further review, however, Chris Harper-Mercer’s MySpace page would seem to indicate that he was not motivated by Islamist terrorism, not that he was. Harper-Mercer shared propaganda for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a Catholic nationalist group, on his profile page: Given that Catholic nationalists who wanted to push back against the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland established the IRA, it’s highly unlikely that someone with radical Islamic beliefs would spread the group’s propaganda. Chris Harper-Mercer also identified himself as “not-religious, but spiritual” in a profile that he posted on a dating website, which would seem unusual for a man with radical Islamic beliefs: Also, Harper-Mercer’s user name was listed on the site as“IRONCROSS45,” a reference to Nazism and symbol of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League : In the United States, however, the Iron Cross also became one of several Nazi-era symbols adopted by outlaw bikers, more to signify rebellion or to shock than for any white supremacist ideology. By the early 2000s, this other use of the Iron Cross had spread from bikers to skateboarders and many extreme sports enthusiasts and became part of the logo of several different companies producing equipment and clothing for this audience. Consequently, the use of the Iron Cross in a non-racist context has greatly proliferated in the United States, to the point that an Iron Cross in isolation (i.e., without a superimposed swastika or without other accompanying hate symbols) cannot be determined to be a hate symbol. Care must therefore be used to correctly interpret this symbol in whatever context in which it may be found. Then, later on, it was reported that a manifesto that Chris Harper-Mercer left behind on the science of the mass shooting made satanic references and said he would be “welcomed in Hell and embraced by the devil.” Few details about the manifesto, or Chris Harper-Mercer’s motives were made clear in the days following the mass shooting. But Chris Harper-Mercer’s father is from Lancashire, England, and local media there spoke with a police spokesperson about the manifesto: Last night a police source confirmed that Mercer – whose father Ian is from Preston, Lancashire – had left behind a typewritten manifesto along with a computer drive outlining his ‘motives’ for the massacre. ”He had a hatred of black people, women, everyone,’ the source said, adding: “The drive and manifesto are being analysed. There is a lot about his hatred of organised religion.” There has been a lot of speculation about what motivated Chris Harper-Mercer to kill, but there’s no indication that he was an Islamist terrorist.

"," There are ordinances that prohibit smoking in cars with children in some cities, but reports that a widespread smoking ban took effect on October 1st is false. A law against smoking in cars with minor passengers did, however, take effect in England on October 1st. The British Parliament approved a ban on smoking in cars with children in early 2015, and the new law took effect on October 1st, the Telegraph reports : A change in the law will come into force on October 1 after 342 MPs voted in favour compared to just 74 against. More than 700 senior doctors backed a legal ban last year, saying that being in an enclosed space like a car significantly worsened the harm done to children by cigarette smoke. The issue has divided political parties and provoked a fierce debate about public health and individual freedom, particularly in the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg previously argued that the ban would be “profoundly illiberal”. Mr Cameron himself had previously questioned the practicalities of a ban, alongside Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, but both changed their minds. As drivers in England geared up for the ban on smoking in cars that have children passengers, rumors spread that the law took effect in the U.S. on October 1st — but that’s not the case. A fake news website called Now 8 News fueled the confusion with a report about the smoking ban in cars with minor passengers: New 8 –  starting October 1, 2015, it will be illegal to smoke in a car or other vehicles, with anyone under the age of 18. The law is changing to protect children and young people from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Both the driver and the smoker in the car could be fined as much as $80. This law applies to every driver, including those age 17 and those with a driving permit. Now 8 News is one of many fake news websites designed to look like local news stations to trick readers into believing its fake reports are true. Still, some cities across the U.S. have passed ordinances that prohibit drivers from smoking in cars with children passengers. The city council in Tempe, Arizona, passed one such ordinance in early 2015, the Arizona Republic reports : Last month, Tempe City Council passed an ordinance to fine drivers $50 for a first offense and $100 for subsequent violations if they smoke while a child is in the car. The ordinance applies to smokers of all types, including e-cigarette smokers. However, police cannot pull over a driver solely for smoking with a child in the car. Police can issue a ticket only if drivers are stopped for another infraction, such as speeding, and have a lit cigarette with a minor present. Officers could cite drivers for each child in the vehicle. A judge could waive the fine for first-time offenders if they enroll in a smoking-cessation program. So, it’s illegal to smoke in cars with minor passengers in some places in the U.S., but reports that a widespread smoking ban took effect on October 1st are false. ","Crime - Police"
"Facebook Drug Task Force Now Monitoring All Posts-Fiction!","2015-09-28 12:39:46","https://www.truthorfiction.com/facebook-drug-task-force-now-monitoring-all-posts/"," A new Facebook Drug Task Force monitors all posts and reports illegal drug activity to authorities. "," A fake news website is behind the false reports of a new Facebook Drug Task Force. National Report , a website that published fake news stories, reported that the Facebook Drug Task Force would be launched on October 1: Beginning October 1st, Facebook will be implementing a drug task force designed to arrest those who buy and sell narcotics while using the online social networking site. Facebook is calling the group the Facebook Drug Task Force, or FDTF, and will be monitoring all postings and messages created by its users. Chairman and chief executive of Facebook, Inc., Mark Zuckerberg, spoke with CNN about the FDTF. “The task force was created to keep users of Facebook safe,” Zucckerberg said. “The FDTF will be working directly with the Drug Enforcement Agency and local law enforcement agencies. We’re gonna put away the bad guys.” National Report has become known for duping readers into believing that the fictitious and satirical stories it publishes are true. But, according to the website’s disclaimer, that’s not the case: National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental. Advice given is NOT to be construed as professional. If you are in need of professional help, please consult a professional. National Report is not intended for children under the age of 18. But many people missed the memo and panicked when they read that previous posts about drugs could make their way to the DEA. High Times reported that hoards of “rattled readers and stupefied stoners” had emailed the magazine with concerns about the false report: Perhaps fueled by the already controversial nature of Facebook’s latest messenger upgrade, which has many users in upheaval over privacy issues, the news of Mark Zuckerberg and his computer cops planning to bust people who use Facebook to communicate with their drug dealers caused the story to go viral and of course, panic ensued. It did not take long before the HIGH TIMES inbox was full of emails from rattled readers and stupefied stoners, some of who believe that George Orwell may have been the first prophet since Jesus Christ, and that big brother was going in for the kill. However, while we certainly appreciate the paranoid enthusiasm, nothing The National Report publishes is real news. Therefore, there is no reason to delete your Facebook account over fears that a Social Media SWAT Team will swoop in at the first mention of weed. Still, that doesn’t mean that Facebook users can post about drugs with impunity. There are many reports from across the country of actual drug task forces making arrests after reading about drug use Facebook, like this one from suburban Milwaukee: A 17-year-old has been arrested and charged with drug possession after a friend posted on the teen’s Facebook page that he needed drugs. A police officer also recognized the two from a video of a drug party in June. A Greenfield police officer was patrolling in his car Aug. 30 when he noticed two men he recognized from his assignment as a police school liaison officer at Greenfield High School. Earlier in the day, he had seen one of them post a statement on the other’s Facebook page that indicated he wanted drugs. The teen behind the page, Justin J. Cervera, had replied, asking the guy to call him. The same officer had previously seen a video of the two apparently smoking marijuana with other juveniles in June 2011, called “Reefer party for my birthday.” He stopped the two on the street and Cervera emptied his pockets, revealing a white prescription bottle with drugs. Cervera was arrested and was charged Thursday with possession of narcotics and marijuana. He faces up to four years in prison and $11,000 in fines. So, there isn’t Facebook Drug Task Force, but there are plenty of drug task forces that use social media to find and arrest people who post about drugs. ","Crime - Police"
"Blue Lines Painted on Curbs Signal “Back Up” for Cops-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-09-17 13:48:37","https://www.truthorfiction.com/blue-lines-painted-on-curbs-signal-back-up-for-cops/"," A blue line painted on a curb outside a home signals to police officers that the homeowner supports the police and is willing to provide “back up” if need be. "," Painting a blue line on curbs outside police-friendly homes is part of the “Safe Harbor Initiative” that was launched on Facebook. But a blue line on a curb doesn’t necessarily signal “safe harbor” for cops, and there are ordinances against painting on curbs in many communities across the country. A Texas man named Anthony Welichko launched the Safe Harbor Initiative on Facebook on September 9, 2015: To all law enforcement who see this (blue) line, know that the residents of this home appreciate your service and dedication to keeping the peace. Know that when you enter the neighborhood and see these lines that you are not alone or without “back-up”. We do not need the media to make our voices of support for our police and emergency services heard ( though it would be nice). Lastly, if you are in my neighborhood and mean to harm a member of law enforcement, know that decision may be hazardous to you health as someone has that officers back! Welichko told KENS5 News in San Antonio that he launched the Safe Harbor Initiative because of high-profile police-involved shootings across the country: “The war against police, if you will, gets a lot of attention. I get the sense that the officers themselves aren’t seeing that support,” said Welichko. He said the blue line is also a reminder for citizens to remember the risks law enforcement face on the job for us. “Every single day they’re here protecting us. Our families. Our children. They absolutely deserve that respect, and they need to know we appreciate that,” said Welichko. Welichko’s Safe Harbor Initiative (not to be confused with the nonprofit group with the same name that fights human trafficking) is a well-purposed attempt to curb violence against police officers. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial reports that fatal ambushes have been the leading causes of firearms-related police deaths in recent years. However, there are two big problems with the idea: painting on curbs is illegal in many places, and blue lines are painted on curbs for many different reasons by city workers. Curbs are public property, so there are often ordinances that prohibit citizens from making markings on them. In South Bend, Indiana, for example , it’s illegal for non-city officials to paint or mark curbs in any way. Anyone who makes unauthorized curb or street paintings in New York City, meanwhile, has 30 days to cover it up before a court summons for “ street defacement ” is issued. These are just two examples; there are countless more across the country. Another problem is that city crews paint blue lines on curbs for many different reasons. Public works departments frequently paint blue lines on curbs, streets and sidewalks to identify water lines that are being worked on, for example. And an Illinois community even began painting blue lines on curbs outside of homes that had overdue water bills to “shame” the homeowners into paying their bills back in 2013, local station WIFR reports . So, the Safe Harbor Initiative has gained traction on Facebook, but it needs to overcome a number of challenges before it takes off across the country. ","Crime - Police"

Jeremiah Burroughs, who is a Gulf war veteran, is suspected of suffering from PTSD syndrome and of extreme paranoia, explains police officer Emet Rubbens. “We have no idea why he committed these atrocious crimes, there seems to lack a motive. What is most distressing is how he got away with these atrocious crimes for such a long period of time.

"Department of Justice Plea Bargain for Dontray Mills-Truth!","2015-09-10 13:25:08","https://www.truthorfiction.com/department-of-justice-plea-bargain-for-dontray-mills/"," Questions about the Department of Justice and President Obama have surfaced after a Milwaukee man was sentenced to one year of probation and no jail time for illegally purchasing 55 guns. "," Dontray Mills was sentenced to a year of probation for illegally purchasing 27 guns, not 55 as has been reported. Dontray Mills was arrested in April 2014 for using false identification to purchase 27 guns at sporting goods stores in suburban Milwaukee. He was charged with knowingly using false identification to buy guns and was released on bail, a local Fox affiliate reports : Brian Dorow with Waukesha County Technical College has no firsthand knowledge of this case — but knows the legal process required to buy a gun. He says false identification — like an address, may not be spotted during the process, so long as no felony record or domestic violence conviction is found. “If that drivers license was obtained fraudulently, it would be hard for that dealer to track,” Dorow said. Mills has neither a felony record, nor a domestic violence conviction. Investigators are now looking into whether the guns were then resold, and whether any potential buyers were criminals who aren’t allowed to have firearms. Dontray Mills was eventually faced 55 total counts that included charges like buying firearms with fake identification and dealing weapons without a license — he was not, as has been reported, charged with buying 55 guns. He struck a plea bargain with federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty to one count. In August 2015, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa sentence Mills to one year of probation and no jailtime, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports : In giving probation with no jail time to a Milwaukee man charged with 55 counts of buying firearms with fake identification and dealing them without a license, a federal judge delivered a message: “People kill people,” U.S. District Rudolph Randa said, echoing a common gun rights slogan. “Guns don’t kill people.” Dontray Mills, 24, purchased a total of 27 firearms, mostly handguns, between December 2012 and April 2014 and pleaded guilty to one of the charges on April 22, 2014, after an ATF investigation. As a result of the conviction, Mills will never again be able to buy firearms legally. On Wednesday, he was sentenced. As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors agreed with the one year of probation. Randa said he recognized the seriousness of the offense and acknowledged the problem of guns winding up in the hands of people who use them to commit violence. But Mills, Randa said, did not come across as a typical defendant because of his good behavior since the charges and his life ambitions, which include becoming a rap musician. While on bail, Mills twice traveled to Los Angeles to work on a film and to pursue his musical aspirations. Randa said he had seen plenty of people facing similar charges who bought firearms for friends and then took no responsibility for their actions. Mills, he said, has accepted responsibility. So, it’s true that Dontray Mills was sentenced to one year of probation after initially being charged with 55 federal counts. No information has been made public, so it’s not clear whether or not Mills provided state evidence that led to other convictions as part of the plea bargain. ","Crime - Police"
"Australia’s Gun Laws Have Led to Higher Crime Rates-Mostly Fiction!","2015-09-03 11:59:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/australias-gun-laws-have-led-to-higher-crime-rates/"," Crime rates in Australia have shot up since a gun ban took effect there in the 1990s. "," Claims that Australia’s gun ban caused crime rates to shoot up don’t check out. Australia rolled out strict gun laws in 1996. Ever since, Australia’s crime rates have been used to argue points on both sides of the gun control debate. Some believe Australia’s crime rates have gone up, others believe they’ve gone down. An email that was supposedly written by an Australian police officer named Ed Chenel cites crime statistics in Australia after stricter gun laws were approved there. The email, which first went viral in 2011, still pops up in many inboxes. We took a look at a number of its specific claims about crime in Australia and found them to be mostly false. First, let’s look at Australia’s gun laws. Before 1996, the states and territories that make up Australia each set their own gun laws. After what became known as the “Port Arthur Massacre” in which a gunman killed 35 people and injured 18 others with a semi-automatic rifle, state and federal governments teamed up on gun reform, according to the Library of Congress : In 1996, following the Port Arthur massacre, the federal government and the states and territories agreed to a uniform approach to firearms regulation, including a ban on certain semiautomatic and self-loading rifles and shotguns, standard licensing and permit criteria, storage requirements and inspections, and greater restrictions on the sale of firearms and ammunition.  Firearms license applicants would be required to take a safety course and show a “genuine reason” for owning a firearm, which could not include self-defense.  The reasons for refusing a license would include “reliable evidence of a mental or physical condition which would render the applicant unsuitable for owning, possessing or using a firearm.”  A waiting period of twenty-eight days would apply to the issuing of both firearms licenses and permits to acquire each weapon. The National Firearms Agreement also implemented a gun buyback program that led to 700,000 weapons being voluntarily surrendered. These stats can be difficult to fact check because they say specific crime rates are up by a certain percentage — but they don’t say over what period. We took a look at how the crime rates have changed since the gun laws took effect using the most recent data we could find. Homicides Are Up 3.2%- Fiction! The number of homicides in Australia has been trending downward since 2001. The Australian Institute of Criminology reports that the homicide rate decreased from 1.8 homicides per 100,000 people in 2002 to 1.1 homicides per 100,000 people in 2012 (the most recent year stats were available). One in 10 homicides in Australia during that time involved a gun. Assaults Are Up 8.6%- Fiction! & Misleading! The number of assaults in Australia has actually increased more than 8.6% since the 1990s. In 1996, there were 789 assaults, and by 2010 there were 972. Over that time, the number of assaults jumped about 19%, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology . Armed Robberies Are Up 45%- Fiction! The number of armed robberies in Australia began to increase in the 1990s and peaked in 2001. Forty armed robberies were recorded per 100,000 people that year. Since then, the number of armed robberies in the country has trended downward. There were 5,628 armed robberies in the country in 2013 , a 9.6% decrease from the year before. Gun Deaths have climbed 300% in Victoria- Unproven! We weren’t able to find recent statistics on the number of gun deaths in Victoria. However, we do know that the number of gun deaths decreased from 4.2 gun deaths per 100,000 people in 1979 to 1.5 per 100,000 people in 2000, the British Medical Journal reports . The Victoria Police also reported that the number of overall homicides in the city decreased by 11.8% from 2013 to 2014. ","Crime - Police"

Members of the Black Panthers led about 25 demonstrators who marched in Texas to protest the death of a black woman named Sandra Bland while in police custody on July 13. A video of the protest taken by Breitbart Texas shows demonstrators, some of them armed, marching outside the Texas jail and chanting “Oink, oink! Bang, Bang!” and “The revolution has come! Off the pigs!” The Houston Chronicle reports that the protests were non-violent, but a handful of protesters were forcefully removed from a lobby: A huge contingent of law enforcement officers was on hand for the protest, which lasted for about two hours and led to no violence or arrests. On Sunday, protesters were forcibly evicted after storming the jail’s lobby. Two elderly people were injured. It’s legal for firearms to be openly carried in Texas, even during protests. Another high-profile case of armed protestors arose in 2013 after 40 armed men showed up outside a meeting on gun control organized by a group of moms, USA Today reports : The sudden appearance of about 40 armed men outside a Dallas-area restaurant this weekend was the latest confrontation between an open-carry gun-rights group and a mothers group advocating gun control that was meeting inside. Police monitored the incident at the Blue Mesa Grill in Arlington, Texas, but took no action because it is legal to carry long guns openly in Texas. “We are aware that a group did gather in a shopping area in Arlington Saturday,” Tiara Ellis Richard of the Arlington Police office of communication said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. “Officers were notified and arrived at the location. There were no issues that we are aware of, and no arrests occurred.” So, this one is true, but armed protests in Texas may not be that out of the ordinary. ","Crime - Police"
"There’s a Mandatory Gun Ownership Law in Kennesaw, Georgia-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-08-06 11:26:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/theres-a-mandatory-gun-ownership-law-in-kennesaw-georgia/"," Kennesaw, a small town in Georgia, passed a mandatory gun ownership law in 1982 that requires the head of every household there to own a gun. "," This one is mostly true, but some of the details are false. Claims about the mandatory gun ownership law in Kennesaw have been making the rounds on social media sites for years. Kennesaw often comes up in debates over whether guns make communities safer or less safe. A Facebook page titled, “Safest City in America … City of Kennesaw, Georgia,” makes a number of claims about the mandatory gun law and the city’s crime rates that are frequently used in these debates. Naturally, these claims are true, false and combination of the two. First, let’s start with the facts. Kennesaw, a suburb of Atlanta with a population of about 32,000, has had a mandatory gun ownership ordinance on the books since 1982. The law grants exceptions for convicted felons, contentious objectors and those who can’t afford guns — but that’s beside the point. The ordinance is symbolic and has never been enforced. When the mandatory gun law was passed in 1982, gun ownership levels there were around 70%. Today, about 50% of the households in Kennesaw own at least one gun, Kennesaw Police Lt. Craig Graydon said. Graydon said nobody has ever been arrested for failing to own a gun, but he believes the mandatory gun ownership law has led to a drop in crime, Reuters reports: “When the law was passed in 1982 there was a substantial drop in crime … and we have maintained a really low crime rate since then,” said police Lt. Craig Graydon. “We are sure it is one of the lowest (crime) towns in the metro area. It’s true that Kennesaw is one of the safest cities in the metro Atlanta area. But let’s take a look at a number of specific claims that are frequently made when it comes to crime and gun ownership in Kennesaw. Kennesaw is the Safest City in America – Fiction! Kennesaw isn’t the safest city in America. The crime index in Kennesaw is 39, which means that it’s safer than 39% of cities in the U.S. One out of every 762 people in Kennesaw are victims of violent crime, and one out of every 49 people are victims of property crime, according to the website Neighborhood Scout . Kennesaw is Among the Safest Cities in Suburban Atlanta- Truth! Kennesaw is one of the safest cities surrounding Atlanta — but it’s not the safest. Let’s look at other suburban communities. In Marietta, the crime index is 7. One out of every 129 people there are victims of violent crime, and one out of 23 are victims of property crime. In Alpharetta, meanwhile, the crime index is 39. One out of every 1,093 people there are victims of violent crime, and one out of every 48 people are victims of property crime. So, compared to other cities in Atlanta, Kennesaw is among the safest. There Hasn’t Been a Murder in Kennesaw Since the Mandatory Gun Law Took Effect- Fiction! This claim is false. There aren’t many murders in Kennesaw, but there have been a handful of them over the years. There was one murder in Kennesaw in 2003, 2004 and 2014, for example. Also, in April 2014, the city drew national headlines after a FedEx employee stormed a company warehouse and shot six people before ending his own life. Two of them suffered life-threatening injuries, ABC News reports . ","Crime - Police"

"," The tale of a Jean Assam using a legally concealed gun to stop a church shooter is true. Jeanne Assam, a former police officer, was working as a volunteer security guard at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, when the shooting unfolded in December 2007, the Denver Post reports : Amid deafening cracks of gunfire, smoke-spewing canisters and the flight of thousands of New Life Church members, Jeanne Assam said she suddenly saw the hallways clear and a gunman come through the door. “I took cover. I identified myself. I engaged him. I took him down,” the 42-year-old former law officer and volunteer church security guard said Monday at a news conference in the Colorado Springs police station. “I just said, ‘Holy Spirit, be with me.’ I wasn’t even shaking,” Assam said. “I give the credit to God. I say this very humbly. God was with me.” 24-year-old Matthew Murray killed two teenaged sisters in the shooting, and a number of parishioners were injured. However, police said without Jeanne Assam’s fast action, the damage would have been much worse. Matthew Murray, who professed hatred for Christianity in a number of online posts, had killed two missionaries at a training center in Arvada, Colorado, the day before the shooting at the New Life Church, the Colorado Springs Gazette reports . In a strange twist, Jeanne Assam said in 2011 that she was asked to leave the New Life Church after she came out as gay. Church officials denied that and said all were welcome at the church. The story of Jeanne Assam resurfaced in June 2015 after a self-described white supremacist killed nine people during bible study at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A social media post inferred that the shooter could have been stopped by an armed victim, like Jeanne Assam had done years earlier. The post also said that Assam’s story had been ignored because it was “inconvenient” for mainstream media outlets’ hidden gun control agenda. So, is it true that armed civilians who regularly stop mass shooters are ignored mainstream media? Data indicates that the answer is “no.” Armed civilians have stopped just 1.6% of mass shootings, so it’s very rare. Still, the story of Jeanne Assam is true. ","Crime - Police"
"Summer Internship Program Is a Front for Human Trafficking-Fiction!","2015-07-02 18:36:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/summer-internship-program-is-a-front-for-human-trafficking/"," Warnings have gone viral that summer internship programs are a front for human trafficking, and applicants are routinely drugged and shipped overseas. "," There aren’t any known summer internship programs that are a front for human trafficking. Some versions of the claim falsely name Vector Marketing’s summer work program as a front for human trafficking, and others don’t name a specific company. Either way, none of the claims check out. Police in Roseville, California, investigated numerous reports of would-be summer interns almost being suckered into human trafficking, and found them to be false: Families claimed the company scheduled an interview where the potential interviewee would be drugged, kidnapped and turned over to human traffickers. Police say that’s not the case, and that the letters are from Vector Marketing, which operates Cutco knives. The company screens, hires and trains contractors to sell its product. Vector marketing says its interviews are conducted at established brand offices and are safe. They aren’t sure how their name was attached to the rumor. The Better Business Bureau also investigated viral warnings about summer internship programs being a front for human trafficking and labeled it a “hoax.” The BBB said: On June second Vector Marketing has become a victim of an online hoax perpetrated by a 21-year-old college student, according to Vector Marketing. The hoax started when a parody twitter account (@TweetLikeAGirl) sent out a tweet to 1 million of its followers warning them about human trafficking rings calling girls offering non-existent job positions.  The tweet never mentioned a specific company name, however overzealous tweeters decided to take it upon themselves to investigate the matter further. An online user posted a letter from Vector Marketing as a response to the initial tweet, instigating a massive re-post on all major social media platforms resulting in a backlash from the public and police involvement. According to Vector Marketing, the company has a summer work program for college students in sales and customer service, the company uses direct mail to advertise these summer work positions. Concerned citizens were seeing the letters and began posting them alongside the warning posts about human trafficking on Facebook, on Tumblr, and on Twitter without fact-checking or any substantiation. As it turns out, Tweet Like a Girl is a parody account that’s operated by 21-year-old man from Tennessee who makes thousands of dollars on novelty Twitter accounts, Buzz Feed reports . Tweet Like a Girl’s tweeted a screen grab of a message that reads: Girls. I just got a call from a business saying that they needed girls to work this summer as a receptionist for $15 an hour. They wanted me to come in for an interview at 3:15 today so I called my mom and this is what she told me. Recently in Humble thre was a girl who got the same type of phone call and when she went inn to interview, something felt off so she left and called the sheriffs office. It was a human trafficking place, they take the girls back to interview and give them a bottle of water that is drugged and the girls wake up halfway around the world. So basically if y’all get a phone call offering you a job, hang up and report them. Please pass along to every girl you know. It’s not clear whether the initial warning was sent from that account, or whether it was copied from another user. A Facebook post that went viral at the same time shows a picture of a Vector recruitment letter and the warning: A few days ago I reblogged a tumblr post warning about a letter being sent to young women urging them to apply for a job of which they gave no details. This group has been drugging girls that show up for the interview and kidnapping them to be used in sex trafficking. The post I saw was based in California, but today I received the same letter. PLEASE DO NOT RESPOND IF ANY OF YOU GET THIS. This is dangerous and repulsive. So, despite millions of Facebook warnings about summer internship programs being a front for human trafficking, there are no credible reports of that actually happening. That’s why we’re calling this one fiction. ","Crime - Police"

FOX News reports : “As of Thursday , family members of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been staying at the Hampton Inn in Revere under very tight security, just one of the things tax dollars are paying for. FOX25’s Sharman Sacchetti investigated how much this trip is costing you. “Sources say these family members are being called as witnesses and not only that, at least three agencies are working around the clock to protect and transport them.

And a source says at least three agencies, the FBI, US Marshal’s and Revere Police are involved in constant protection.” Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s defense team was expected to call his relatives to testify about the “impact of being reared in a traditional Chechen Muslim household” as jurors considered the death penalty, the Boston Globe reports : “The funds to bring Tsarnaev’s overseas relatives to Boston for the trial likely comes from federal money approved by the presiding judge for the defense. George Kendall, a New York attorney who specializes in death penalty cases nationwide, said the court system bears the cost of transporting all witnesses, whether they are an expert from a nearby state or a family member from abroad. “The defense must prove to the judge that the witnesses are critical for the defense case, in order for their travel to be paid for by the government, but they are not required to take the stand and testify. Legal specialists say the defense could ask for the family witnesses to help provide guidance on the case, but could decide they don’t need each of them to testify.” Because U.S. District Judge George A. O’Toole, who presided over trial, had sealed the majority of documents related tothe Boston Marathon bombing trial, the exact cost of the travel expenses — and of the trial as a whole — are not known, Boston.com reports : “Some of the sealed documents could shed light on how many taxpayer dollars are going to pay for Tsarnaev’s defense. But we don’t know. Because they’re sealed. Chris Tritico, who represented Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, said the high volume of sealed documents could be designed to protect Tsarnaev. “’It’s important to remember that a defendant’s right to a fair trial trumps the public’s right,’ Tritico said. ‘When the court feels the media attention is so strong, it has to do something to protect the defendant’s rights.’” Death penalty trails are typically costly for taxpayers. The cost of legal representation alone in death penalty cases averaged about $218,000 through the 1990s. That doesn’t include travel and other costs for witnesses, experts, security and investigators, according to a government report . ","Crime - Police"
"CNN Anchor Brooke Baldwin Blames Veterans for Baltimore Violence-Previously Truth! Now Resolved!","2015-05-14 22:58:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cnn-anchor-brooke-baldwin-blames-veterans-for-baltimore-violence/"," CNN Anchor Brooke Baldwin blamed the violence that followed the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore on veterans who became police officers. "," It’s true that CNN Anchor Brooke Baldwin said that veterans who become police officers are “ready to do battle” and lack a connection to the communities they serve. However, Brooke Baldwin later apologized and said that she was rehashing a conversation that she had had with a city council member when she made the statement. Brooke Baldwin made the statement during a live broadcast on April 28, 2015. She was covering the protests and riots in Baltimore that followed the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray while in police custody.  Baldwin made her initial comments during an interview with U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.): “I was talking to a city councilman last week (about police officers) who said, ‘Brooke, these people have to live in the community or there is no emotional investment, or there is a lack of emotional investment.’ A lot of these young people, I’ve been talking about it so much, a lot of these young people, and I love our nation’s veterans, but as some of them are coming back from war, they don’t know the communities, and they are ready to do battle.” Brook Baldwin’s claim that veterans who become officers were “ready to do battle” set off a firestorm of criticism on social media and blog sites. The next day, she made an on-air apology : “I wanted to make sure that I came on first thing this morning and told everyone that I made a mistake. We were in the middle of live TV, and I was talking to a member of Congress, and I was recounting a conversation that I had with someone recently that referred to police. I absolutely misspoke. Un-artfully chose my words 100%. I wish speaking to all of you this morning, I wholeheartedly retract what I said. I thought tremendously about this, to our nation’s, you are who I want to speak with this morning, I have the upmost respect for men and women in uniform, and I wanted you to know that this morning. To all of you: I owe you a tremendous apology, I am truly sorry.” Then, later in the day, Brook Baldwin issued a second on-air apology for her comments: “But for the second time today, I just wanted to take a moment and discuss something I said on my show just yesterday, and I just want to apologize. During my show, I gave credence to the idea that veterans returning from war who were police officers were furthering the problems in communities like these here in Baltimore and nationwide. And I just have to take a moment again today to say I was wrong. I was so wrong. To speak the way I did, involving our men and women in uniform, to perpetuate this false narrative, is on me, I own it, and I apologize. Please… let’s move on.” It seems that Brooke Baldwin mixed two separate ideas in her initial comments: the idea that officers should live in the cities that they serve, and the idea that former veterans make bad or aggressive police officers. There may be some truth to the first point. Many critics of Baltimore’s police force have echoed the claim that officers who live outside the city don’t have an emotional connection to it. The New York Times reports that about 33% of the city’s police force lives in the city, and many residents believe that has created a divide between the community and the police force. But there’s no evidence or data to support the idea that former veterans make bad cops. ","Crime - Police"

"," This is a scam. Many people have reported receiving phone calls from the IRS Fraud Division. The caller typically asks for personal information, or tells the victim that they have to send money to the IRS and provides an address. The IRS said the scam has targeted many recent immigrants, but that other people are at risk for it, too. The callers provide fake IRS identification badge numbers and alter caller ID screen displays to make it appear they are from the IRS: “Victims are told they owe money to the IRS and it must be paid promptly through a pre-loaded debit card or wire transfer. If the victim refuses to cooperate, they are then threatened with arrest, deportation or suspension of a business or driver’s license. In many cases, the caller becomes hostile and insulting. Or, victims may be told they have a refund due to try to trick them into sharing private information.” The IRS notes that there are a few easy ways to tell when someone is impersonating the IRS: The IRS never demands immediate payment, and all tax bills are mailed. Taxpayers always have the right to question or appeal the amount you owe. The IRS never requires specific payment methods like a prepaid debit card. The IRS never asks for credit card or debit card numbers over the phone. The IRS will never threaten to call local police or law enforcement groups to arrest you for not paying. IRS phone scams became a big problem during the 2015 tax season. The Federal Trade Commission said that it had received more than 55,000 complaints of IRS fraudsters.

There haven’t been any credible reports of abductors lacing $100 bills with a chemical that knocks out their victims. Police in Clarksville, Tennessee, actually investigated the claim after a number of residents shared the post. Their investigation didn’t turn anything up, according to a Facebook post that begins, “Social Media HOAX Alert! If you receive a post about a $100 bill laced with chemicals and then placed on vehicles, it is a HOAX!” Police said they investigated the claim after a woman in Clarksville reported that she had been the victim of this scam at a Burlington Coat Factory there. Turns out, there is no Burlington Coat Factor in Clarksville. Police also said they weren’t aware of any chemicals that are strong enough to knock a person out on contact, so this one is a hoax. But that doesn’t mean you should grab a $100 from your windshield if you see one there. This eRumor is very similar to actual reports of car thefts that occurred after a driver stopped to grab a $100 bill that had been placed on the windshield, a Fox News affiliate reports : “That scam works like this: After getting in your car, you find a crisp $100 bill on your windshield. When you get out of your car to retrieve your gift, there is a scammer waiting around the area and rushes into the driver seat of your car. You are left without a car, and who knows if you’ll still have that $100 bill. These scams have been reported most recently in Las Vegas and Maryland.” Some windshield advertisements are also fashioned to look like $100 bills to help them get noticed. So, if you see a $100 bill on your windshield, it’s probably best to leave it there until you get home. ","Crime - Police"

A spokeswoman for the unions say it will be up throughout the month of August. “Changes in the pension system – which strip more money from the paychecks of officers and firefighters – were made necessary by a deficit in the police and fire retirement fund that could have cost the cash-strapped city $65 million. That problem came as the mayor had to close a $121 million budget shortfall by raising taxes and new fees. “Union officials have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city of purposely underfunding the pension system and arguing that the changes violate contractual labor agreements.” A photo of the billboard resurfaced on social media in May 2015 after six police officers were arrested in the death of Freddie Gray. Many assumed that the Welcome to Baltimore billboard had just been put up, but that wasn’t the case. However, the Baltimore Police Union has been vocal in its support for the arrested officers. The union started an online #MyLifeMatters campaign to support the police officers.

This type of fraud is called “ phishing .” It happens when a fraudster poses as a company or government agency to get a victim to give up personal information. This eRumor deals with a specific type of phishing that is called “ spear phishing .” That happens when a scammer already has some personal information — like a name or credit card number — and uses it to get a victim to give up even more personal information, the Royal Bank of Canada reports : “A recent rise in data breaches involving email marketing providers has resulted in a large volume of names and email addresses being accessed by fraudsters. This type of data breach opens the door to a specific type of convincing email scam called ‘spear phishing,’ where the sender can identify you by name and send an email that appears to be from a company that you deal with. The goal is to get you to open the email and provide the fraudsters with your personal information.” A telephone version of the spear phishing scam surfaced in West Virginia in 2010. The West Virginia Office of Technology issued a scam alert that warned fraudsters had posed as Visa and Master Card representatives and asked cardholders for their three-digit security code in order to investigate a fraudulent purchase. That scam alert is the exact same text that appears in the chain email that is marking the rounds on the web. If a fraudster already has a victim’s credit card number but not the three-digit security code on the back of the card, they will be unable to use the card to make online purchases. That’s why cardholders should never give up their security code over the phone, according to Visa : “The three-digit security code shown on the back of your Visa card lets merchants know that you’re physically holding the card when you make a purchase online or over the phone. It’s yet another layer of protection Visa implements to prevent fraud before it happens.” Credit card companies say that consumers should never reveal personal information over the phone. Cardholders should hang up and call the 800-number on the back of their credit card if they receive a suspicious phone call from the company. ","Crime - Police"

"," The origin of the eRumor comes from an October 7, 2012 article from the Whiteout Press but these are the ramblings of someone who appears to know very little about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and World War II history of Nazi Germany. According to their website, FEMA Corps is a program that creates a pool of trained team members ranging from ages 18 to 24 to assist in disaster recovery.   The mission of this program is to establish a unit of 1,600 service corps members dedicated to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. The benefit of this program is to prepare participants “for careers in emergency management and other related fields, building depth in the emergency management community.”  The first 480 members began training in August 2012 and became ready for deployment in September 2012.  The next training program begins in Winter 2013. FEMA Corps members are compensated for their time. According to the FAQ on their website, “FEMA Corps members receive a living allowance of approximately $4,000 for the 10 months of service (about $200 every two weeks before taxes), housing, meals, limited medical benefits” and members can receive up to an additional $400 a month for childcare.   After the first 10 month term of service there is an option to extend for a second year. Comparison to Hitler Youth Hitler Youth were created in the 1920’s and targeted boys and girls from the ages of 10 to 18. It began as a voluntary program but in 1936, after Adolf Hitler came into power the program became compulsory.   According to the Historylearingsite , the “task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service. For girls, the organization prepared them for motherhood.”    Members of FEMA Corps do not fall into to this age range nor are they trained or prepared for the military. The photo in the forwarded email depicting a young team of FEMA Corps members fully armed and ready to respond is inaccurate. According to a May 13, 2009 article in the New York Times the group in the photo are Explorer Scouts in a simulated counter terrorism training exercise, which occurred in California’s Imperial County under the leadership of local law enforcement and Border Patrol. The article said, “The Explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence — an intense ratcheting up of one of the group’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.” DHS Armament? The writer of the eRumor also alleged that the DHS is raising an army and ordered billions of rounds of ammunition.  The DHS oversees agencies that conduct  law enforcement, military missions, and immigration enforcement. In a February 14, 2013 article by Fox News , it was disclosed that DHS training centers have used as much as 15 million rounds annually for training exercises and practice on shooting ranges. The article also said that the DHS plans to purchase 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling it “the federal government’s second largest criminal investigative agency.” But ICE is not the only armed agency under the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Secret Service, the intelligence agency that was originally under the Department of the Treasury has the responsibility of protecting the President and dignitaries.  This agency has been under the blanket of the DHS since March 1, 2003.   One agency under the DHS that could be considered to be a major user of weapons and ammunition is the United States Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is on loan to the DHS from the Department of Transportation and has enough fire power to protect U.S. ports, chase and apprehend pirates and smugglers and assist in the protection of our military assets and facilities in the Persian Gulf.

"," The federal government has launched a pilot program that will provide training to police departments in six cities, but it’s not true that the departments are being federalized. The six cities will take part in the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice pilot program. The program is part of the “ My Brother’s Keeper ” initiative that President Obama set up in 2014 in an effort to “create opportunities for all young people.” Attorney General Eric Holder said in March of 2015 that the first six cities to take part in the program would be Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Worth, Texas; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Stockton, California: “The Department of Justice is committed to using innovative strategies to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation in communities where trust has been eroded,” said Attorney General Holder.  “By helping to develop programs that serve their own diverse experiences and environments, these selected cities will serve on the leading edge of our effort to confront pressing issues in communities around the country.” According to the Department of Justice, $4.75 million will be used to develop a plan that enhances procedural justice, reduces racial bias and supports reconciliation in these six cities. A board of advisors from academic, law enforcement, faith-based and civil rights backgrounds will lead the program, the DOJ said . The stated goal of the program is to provide technical assistance, research and organizational support to help police departments improve community relations.

"Hotel key cards being used for identity theft?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:45:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/keycards/"," A warning that key cards issued to hotel or motel guests as room keys are being used for identity theft. The story says that Southern California Law Enforcement professionals discovered that some hotel room keys include the guest’s name, credit card information, and other data that could be used for identity theft. "," Hotels and resorts are increasingly issuing credit card-looking “key cards” to guests instead of traditional metal keys for use in opening the doors to guest rooms. That’s increased security for guests since metal keys could be easily duplicated and most of them had the number of the room stamped on them making it easy for a stolen or lost key to be used for entry. The key cards do not have any visible indication of what room they open.  They also have a magnetic strip on the back that can be programmed, for example, with the dates that the guest is going to use the room so that the key cannot be used after that unless it is programmed with fresh information. Do hotel key cards have guests’ personal information on them?  We surveyed several major hotels in California, Nevada, and Florida and the consensus was emphatic:  No hotel key cards have any personal information on them, not even the guest’s name.  There are some hotels, such as the Hard Rock and Portofino Hotels in Orlando, Florida, that have allow key cards to be used for purchases, but there is no identifying information on the key card. The purchases are billed to the room number and added to the guests hotel charges. One fraud detective we talked with said the eRumor may have been prompted by a police case from Southern California where investigators broke up a group of foreign credit card crooks. They had a large number of stolen key cards from a particular hotel.  The police decided to scan them to see what was on them and they found credit card debit card numbers, not hotel room information.  The reason, according to the detective, is that the crooks can use a credit card scanning device to steal credit and debit card information, program it on to a hotel key card and use it just like the original card.  He said that there was a case in Fresno where a member of a foreign credit card fraud gang was an employee at a gas station. He had made a device that would scan customers’ credit and debit card info on to a hotel key card at the same time that the card was being used for a purchase. A few months after the eRumor started circulating in 2003, we began getting inquiries about information said to have come from the Pasadena, California police department about the risk of key cards. The Pasadena police department issued a press release saying that there had been concerns expressed by a detective and his comments got circulated by various individuals before the issue was completely investigated.  The release confirms that Pasadena detectives contacted several large hotels and computer companies using key card technology who confirmed that the key cards are not programmed with personal information and does not have credit card numbers on them.

A spokesperson said the commissioner was “deeply concerned at the disproportionate number of young African-Americans who die in encounters with police officers, as well as the disproportionate number of African Americans in U.S. prisons and on death row.” According to the spokesperson, “High Commissioner urged the US authorities to conduct in-depth examinations into how race-related issues are affecting law enforcement and the administration of justice.” Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. testified before the United Nations Committee Against Torture in November of 2014. During their testimony, McSpadden and Brown read from a prepared statement : “The intimidation caused by the shooting of Michael Brown and the disrespect for his body was amplified by the impunity that followed. Officer Wilson has not been arrested, and public officials have shown a clear reluctance to actively pursue his prosecution.” McSpadden and Brown said Wilson’s prosecution had raised questions about “bias in favor of the police.” They also called for Wilson’s arrest, political accountability for excessive force against protestors and an end to racial profiling. The false report that the UN had “dismissed the Michael Brown case” was started by the National Report, a fake news website.

"," No arrests have been made in Tupac Shakur’s 1996 murder. The eRumor surfaced in September of 2014 after Huzlers, a fake news website, published an article that claimed Sean “Puffy” Combs had been arrested for ordering the hit on Shakur: “On Thursday, September 17th, 2014, the arrest of Sean “Puffy” Combs may have been undertaken by authorities for the 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur on the Las Vegas, Nevada Strip. Associates in Combs’ organization have indicated off-the-record that, yes, Sean Combs was in fact under arrest. This disclosure comes just days after the 18th anniversary of the so far unsolved murder of the mega-superstar, Tupac Shakur. “In a press release with the date of September 16th, 2014, a spokesperson for the Las Vegas District Attorney’s office said that there has come sufficient evidence to make an arrest and to obtain conviction for the murder of Shakur in 1996. This most probably indicates that an arrest warrant has been issued.” Huzlers describes its own content as “bad fake news poorly written,” but it’s false account of Combs’ arrest drew lots of attention. That’s because it came days before the 18th anniversary of Shakur’s death, and because it echoed claims made by a former LAPD detective. In the 2011 book “Murder Rap,” former detective Greg Kading claimed that the LAPD had “extensive tapes and documents and confessions from key players behind the alleged assassinations of Shakur” and Christopher Wallace, who is known as the Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls, LA Weekly reports . In his self-published book, Kading claims that a member of the Southside Crips told police that Combs offered $1 million for the murders of Shakur and Suge Knight, the CEO of Bad Boy Records, on the Las Vegas Strip in 1996. Wallace, a friend and associate of Combs, was then killed six months later in retaliation, according to Kading’s account. A more plausible theory is that gang member Orlando Anderson killed Tupac after a run-in with the famous rapper and his entourage a few hours earlier. Surveillance videotape captured Shakur and Knight beating Anderson in a hotel lobby earlier that night, Forbes reports : “Orlando Anderson, on the other hand, did talk about it. The day after Tupac was shot, according to intelligence from then-gang detectives in the City of Compton, California, Orlando bragged all over the gang-infested streets in his ‘hood that he was the gunman who shot Tupac. But Orlando did not say word one about being hired to pull it off. “Tupac’s murder appears to be street justice, plain and simple. Tupac and Suge beat up Orlando, so Orlando and his buddies went after Suge and Tupac the same night and shot them in a car-to-car shooting, at the passenger side where Tupac was sitting. Suge was hit with a bullet fragment in the base of his neck and survived; Tupac was shot several times, including in the chest, and died six days later.” However, the truth may never be known. Anderson was killed 18 months after Shakur’s death in an unrelated shootout, the Guardian reports . ","Crime - Police"

"Halloween is National Kill a Pit Bull Day – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nation-kill-pit-bull-day/"," A flier appearing on social media sites alleges that October 31 has been proclaimed National Kill a Pit Bull Day. "," There is no such thing as National Kill a Pit Bull Day. The hoax targeted a city council member from Slater, Missouri, who helped create a vicious animal ordinance that placed safety restrictions on all pet owners in the city, the Marshall Democrat-News reports . Slater City Council Member Terry Jordan, who was named in the flier, initially supported an ordinance that would have immediately listed pit bulls as “vicious” animals. However, Jordan changed his mind about the breed after hearing expert testimony. The city council ultimately decided that a breed-specific restriction could hurt the city. “We did change our minds,” Jordan told the newspaper. “We made a vicious dog ordinance and not a pit bull specific ordinance.” The unidentified person who circulated the flier apparently didn’t get the memo. The eRumor sparked public outrage when it went viral on Facebook and Twitter. One concerned pit-bull advocate even started a petition on Change.org to “NOT” declare Halloween as National Kill a Pit Bull Day. The petition has more than 270 supporters. The National Kill a Pit Bull Day hoax first surfaced in 2012 just before Halloween, and it’s likely to resurface each year as Halloween approaches. Posted 10/01/14 ","Crime - Police"
"Plant a Pig to Stop Mosque Construction-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/plant-a-pig/"," Construction of a mosque in Seville, Spain, ground to a halt after a pig was buried on the site because Muslims believe mosques cannot be built on “pig soiled ground.” "," Opponents of mosques around the world have used what’s referred to as the “plant a pig movement” in an attempt to bring construction to a halt, but the so-called “Muslim Kryptonite” hasn’t prevented the construction of any mosques. The proposed construction of a mosque in Seville, Spain, in 2008 carried a great deal of cultural significance. It had been 750 years since the city’s last mosque had been converted into a Christian church in 1248. Seville residents pushed back on the mosque’s proposed construction, and the plant a pig movement was born. By November 2010, construction of the mosque still wasn’t underway when citizens launched “Operation Gorrino,” as it was dubbed, and staged a funeral before burying a pig on land the city had committed to the mosque, MinutoDigital reports . A video of the protest showed about “15 people young people” burying a pig on the site. In the end, the mosque was never constructed there, according to IslamicFinder.com . However, reports indicate that the project was doomed by lack of funding rather than the so-called Muslim Kryptonite. Another high-profile instance of the plant a pig movement cropped up in Switzerland in 2011. Police in Solothum Canton found pig body parts and pig blood buried on the site of a mosque after an anonymous tip, CNN reports . A Central Islamic Council spokesperson said the stunt had “crossed the line” and mirrored recent “Islamophobia” in the region. But the plant a pig movement didn’t prompt the partitioners to stop using the mosque. “We can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground, so we do not fear from this side anything,” the Central Islamic spokesperson said.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, the Grand Jury got it ALL WRONG. The video was originally posted at YouTube in September of 2012 under the headline “Only n Woodland City.” The apartment complex shown in the video appears to be a large housing development in Dallas, Texas, called Woodland City Apartments , a place that Michael Brown never lived. The poor quality of the video makes it difficult to determine whether the man shown attacking the elderly man has the same facial features as Michael Brown. But the man in the video appears to be much shorter than Michael Brown was. Standing somewhere between 6’4” and 6’5” tall, Michael Brown would have towered over the men he stood beside on the apartment stoop. Instead, they were all of equal height. The man in the video also doesn’t weigh more than 300 pounds, so he’s much smaller than Michael Brown was. The user who first posted the video on Facebook in December of 2014 quickly removed the link, which led many people to speculate that Facebook administrators had censored the link: WOW FACEBOOK TOOK DOWN THE PRIVATE HOME VIDEO I HAD ON MY PAGE OF MIKE BROWN BEATING AN OLD MAN AND ROBBING HIM OF HIS BACKPACK!

Less than two hours after take off all contact with the plane.   Two passengers who were listed as being on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight turned up elsewhere and reported that their passports had been stolen. Responders in the air and on the sea have found an oil slick and some debris but these have not been connected with Flight MH370.   The plane is still missing and  conspiracy theories of a terrorist attack are flying on the World Wide Net. "," TruthOrFiction.Com is following this story and all allegations of foul play, terrorism or alien abduction.  We will post findings here as they develop.  So far, this remains a mystery. Update 03/24/14: Prime Minister Najib Razak said that Malaysia MH370 flight ended in Indian Ocean. The government in Malaysia said today that they have concluded that, “based on satellite data analysis from British company Inmarsat, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ended in the Indian Ocean, and no one on board survived.”  This according to a March 24, 2014 article by the U.K.’s Telegraph that said Prime Minister Najib Razak said that “Inmarsat engineers have been able to establish that the plane’s last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.”   Razak added, “This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.” Update 03/16/14: Investigators now believe that H370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan. According to a March 16, 2014 article by the Daily Mail in England, investigators now believe that the missing MH370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan.  The article said, “A Malaysian government official said people with significant flying experience could have turned off the flight’s communication devices. The representative said that hijacking theory was now ‘conclusive’, and, as a result, police have raided the luxury homes of both the captain and the co-pilot.” The pilot and co-pilot of the the 777 Zahari Ahmad Shah (photo left) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (photo right) “are now being investigated as police in Kuala Lumpur search for signs of foul play.” Background Loss of contact and sudden course change Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off on March 8 at 12:21AM (local time) from Kuala Lumpur and was expected to land in Beijing approximately 6:30AM.  The jet had reached an altitude of 35,000 feet when contact was lost with the plane at approximately 2:40AM. According to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today , the Malaysian military radar indicated that Flight 370 made a sharp turn and “flew at least as far as the Malacca Strait west of Malaysia.”    The article said, “Malaysian authorities have said the plane’s electronic signaling transponder apparently stopped working at about the time civilian flight controllers lost contact with it, near the coast of Vietnam.”  Malaysian Air Force Air Force chief General Rodzali Daud told reporters that military radar data showed  “the track of the plane then turning sharply and eventually flying over the island of Pulau Perak — hundreds of miles off course.” Responders in the air and on the sea are busy conducting search and rescue for the missing airliner but so far any debris or oil slicks found on the water have been determined not to be connected with the missing airliner.  This according to a March 9, 2014 article by USA Today. The Chinese Satellite Image Search planes were dispatched Thursday to conduct a search of an area where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  After a series of search patterns, spotters were unable to find anything.  This according to a March 13, 2014 article by CBS News. U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Flew On for Hours On March 13. 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that “Aviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. 777’s engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program.”    The article said that “investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted “with the intention of using it later for another purpose.” Course change On March 14, 2014 Reuters exclusively reported that “Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators.”    The article said that there are indications that the missing 777 was “either being flown by the pilots or someone with knowledge of those waypoints.” U.S. Military Believes 777 May have Crashed in Indian Ocean A March 13, 2014 news update by England’s Daily Mail reported that the “U.S. military say they believe missing Malaysian jet has crashed in the Indian Ocean and send navy vessel to the area.”   The article said, “U.S. destroyer USS Kidd is now reportedly being moved in to search the area, while Malaysia was due to ask for radar data from India and other neighbouring countries to see if they can trace the plane flying north west.” Stolen Passports used to board missing airliner According to a timeline in a March 10,2014 article by Britain’s Telegraph, Malaysian authorities are investigating the “identities of at least two other passengers in addition to two who were found to be using stolen passports.” Luigi Maraldi, shown on the left, whose name appeared on the passenger list, reported that his passport had been stolen.   Investigating the incident are the Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister along with their counterparts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Telegraph said, “Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is ‘examining additional suspect passports.'” In a later report , the Telegraph reported that “two men travelling on stolen passports on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that mysteriously disappeared on Saturday have been identified as Iranian nationals.”  The article said that the two Iranians “were travelling on passports belonging to Christian Kozel, an 30-year-old Austrian, and Luigi Maraldi, a 37-year-old Italian.” Two Iranian Nationals boarded the plane Security camera photos of the Iranian passengers using stolen passports were released on March 11.1. According to a March 11, 2014 article by Fox News , images “showed the two Iranian men boarding a plane at the same time. Interpol secretary general Ronald K. Noble said Tuesday the two men traveled to Malaysia on their Iranian passports, then apparently switched to the stolen Austrian and Italian documents.”   Noble added, that “recent information about the men made terrorism a less likely cause of the plane’s disappearance, but that did not allay concerns about the ease of travel involving stolen passports.” Cell phones of missing passengers still ringing A few family members of passengers of  the missing MH370 airliner said that  “dialing the numbers resulted in ringing tones on the other end, even though the calls weren’t picked up.”  This according to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today.    The families have encouraged the airline to search for the global positioning satellite (GPS) location of their loved ones’ mobile phones.  Experts in the cellular phone industry said  that a ringing phone is necessarily an indication that the calls went through.  Industry analyst Jeff Kagan told reporters, that the ringing is “just telling you that the network is in the process of finding and connecting to it.” Black hole theory shot down On March 19, 2014 CNN “anchor Don Lemon read a pair of tweets he received from viewers suggesting the plane’s disappearance could be the result of a “black hole,” Bermuda Triangle or an occurrence akin to the television series ‘Lost.'”  Lemon then pursued the possibility of a black hole encounter Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general, and said, “I know it’s preposterous, but is it preposterous, do you think, Mary?”  Schiavo agreed that it was preposterous and added,”a small black hole would suck in our entire universe. So we know it’s not that.

"Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder-Truth!","2015-03-17 21:40:54","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarypanthers/"," According to the eRumor, in the late 1960’s, two Black Panthers were tried for murder in the death of a fellow Black Panther, Alex Rackley.  Rackley was tortured before being killed.  The Panthers who were tried, Warren Kimbro and Erica Huggins, escaped prosecution thanks, in part, to the defense of Hillary Clinton.  Warren Kimbro went on to Harvard and became Assistant Dean of Eastern Connecticut State College.  Erica Huggins was elected to a school board. "," This eRumor has developed a life of its own with differing interpretations of what is true or not true about it. It circulated widely during Hillary Rodham Clinton’s year 2000 run for the U.S. Senate. According to published accounts, Alex Rackley was a Panther recruit from New York who was tortured and killed in New Haven, Connecticut because he was suspected of being a police informant.  Twelve Panthers were indicted including Warren Kimbro, Erica Huggins, and Panther leader Bobby Seale.  Contrary to the email, Kimbro was not proven to be the “shooter” and did not stand trial, but did plead guilty to second degree murder.  He was later released from prison and admitted to Harvard.  We have not found evidence that he was a college dean.  Another Panther was convicted of having fired the fatal shot and was sentenced to life in prison.  Huggins and Seale were tried together, but the jury deadlocked and their cases were dismissed. The Bobby Seales trial drew protests, not because the protestors approved of murder, but they felt that the Panthers were being treated unfairly by the authorities and that Seales, who was not personally involved in the killing, should not have been tried.  There were demonstrations at Yale, but they were  peaceful, did not “shut down” the university. Hillary was not an attorney at that time (which is what some of the versions of this email seem to suggest), but a student at Yale and, according to Roger Morris, author of PARTNERS IN POWER, helped organize shifts of students to monitor the courtroom. John Elvin of Insight magazine looked into the Hillary-Panthers eRumor as well as how it was handled by some urban legends sites and wrote his findings in an article that appeared in July of 2000.  He quotes former sixties radical David Horowitz as saying that both Hillary Rodham and Bill Lann Lee organized demonstrations at Yale against the Panther trial.  Elvin also says, “Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, Brock and Roger Morris for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as Barbara Olson’s Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back Horowitz’s contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests.” Conservative commentator Joseph Farah says she also assisted Seales’ lawyer, Charles Garry. That was all a long time ago and most of us would not want to be characterized by our views and activities in college or graduate school, but, for whatever it’s worth, they do become a part of our story.

Lets address this one at at time: Are these Coffins? The items in the photos that usually accompanies this forwarded email are not coffins but burial vaults or grave liners made by the Vantage Products Corporation.   These burial vaults are designed to house coffins and protect buried coffins from the elements for hundreds of years. Screen shot from Vantage Products website. Does FEMA own the items in the photo of the forwarded email? The coffins in the photo do not belong to FEMA.  According to an August 11, 2008 article by the Morgan County Citizen in Atlanta, Georgia, Vantage Products began leasing this land in 1997 or 1998 to store their products.   Since grave liners are weatherproof this location proved to be an affordable storage site for anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 grave liners. Did U.S. patent # 5,425,163, describe the items as “cremation containers for multiple bodies?” The above patent for a “multi-functional cremation container” was granted on June 20, 1995, by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has regularly been cited as the alleged proof that FEMA is pushing forward with plans for camps to carryout mass cremations.    Patent, No. 5,425,163 expired and nobody holds it. It lapsed on June 20, 1999, because its original owners, Raymond Von Braun and Robert Millby, failed to pay patent maintenance fees. This eRumor once again rose from the ashes after a January 23, 2014 article by the website TellMeNow.Com said that President Obama had allegedly purchased $1 billion in disposable FEMA coffins that are being stored at FEMA camps around the country. Ghoulish photos even depicted people sitting in black, plastic containers that are big enough to hold “three or four bodies,” the article said, at one such camp in Madison, Georgia. Do FEMA Camps exist??? The FEMA Camps part of the eRumor and conspiracy theory still remains to be proven.  There have been several natural disasters in the U.S. since the inception of this conspiracy theory.  One would think that if these camps existed, the thousands of evacuees of the August 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster would have been taken to a camp instead of the Houston Astrodome. AP News photo of Katrina victims in Astrodome FEMA Background and Mission: FEMA is the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Their main mission, according to their website is “to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards.” FEMA falls under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and is the main training resource for the Incident Command System (ICS), the special training given to all first responders in the United States.  Their online courses are available free to anyone and certificates of passing the courses are emailed to the students. Click for ICS Training Since FEMA deals with disasters and getting resources to affected areas there is nothing really suspicious about this agency stockpiling MRE’s.

"Department of Defense Procedures to Shut Up Civilians-Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dod-interment-resettlement-ops/"," This is a forwarded link to a video posted on YouTube that warns a manual for Interment and Resettlement Operations by U.S. Department of Defense.  The narrator on the video alleges that the operations will be used on citizens in the U.S. "," The manual appears to be real and was dated 12 February 2010 but it is what the narrator of the video calls “leaked.” We have no indication that it is a current policy of the Department of the Defense (DOD) or that the government has policies in place to incarcerate U.S. Civilians. This manual was found by reference number “FM 3-39.40” on an official military publications site .  That site requires a DOD approval certificate log, which we do not have at the time of this writing to authenticate the “leaked” copy with the official manual. Another unofficial copy of the manual was found posted on the Internet where anyone can download and read. Click to download manual. It is possible that the narrator is spinning a conspiracy theory that the government is out to get us from his interpretation of this manual.  The video’s allegations could be a misinterpretation of what is written in the manual because branches of the DOD are part of the logistical team that are used throughout the world when natural disasters strike. The preface of the manual states that the military police operations could be called in to assist in disaster relief efforts both nationally and abroad: Military police conduct I/R operations during offensive, defensive, stability, or civil support operations. I/R operations include military police support to U.S. military prisoner and detainee operations within operational environments (OEs), ranging from major combat operations to humanitarian-assistance missions in support of a host nation (HN) or civil agency. On page 14  the manual there is a flow chart that shows that “Displaced Civilians” (DC) come under resettlement operations and not classified as “Detainees.”   Yet, there is a classification for “Civilian Internees” (CI) who fall under the Detainee category.  In this context. an enemy combatant affiliated with a terrorist cell would come under the category of CI where the victim of a flood or earthquake whose home or city was destroyed could come under DC.  Under the heading of DC are included refugees, migrants, expellees, internally displaced persons, evacuees and stateless persons. Flow chart found on page 14 of the manual Civilian Internee (CI) is defined in the manual on page 17: 1-10. A CI is a civilian who is interned during armed conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense against the detaining power. (JP 3-63) CIs, unless they have committed acts for which they are considered unlawful combatants, generally qualify for protected status according to the GC, which also establishes procedures that must be observed when depriving such civilians of their liberty. CIs are to be accommodated separately from EPWs and persons deprived of liberty for any other reason. Displaced Civilian is not defined but the manual does describe how they should be treated on page 33: DISPLACED CIVILIAN HANDLING 2-10. Military police units may be required to support the collection and control of DCs. In offensive, defensive, and stability operations many of the fundamentals are similar to that of handling detainees, but the focus is typically different. The handling of DCs is also a mission that may be performed in support of disaster relief or other emergencies within the United States or U.S. territories during civil support operations. As such, local, state and federal agencies are primarily responsible for handling DCs with the U.S. military in a support role. When a state of emergency is declared, the state’s national guard may be called to assist with DCs under the control of the state governor or they may be federalized and conduct operations as federal U.S. military forces. (See Titles 10 and 32, U.S. Code [USC].) It is important to keep in mind that such a manual was designed to handle an unlimited number of possible scenarios where agencies under the  U.S. Department of Defense play a role. The video also alleges that FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) would be involved.   In the event of a natural disaster in the U.S. these agencies would be involved.  FEMA provides the Incident Command System training for all US agencies involved in response missions.  FEMA comes under the blanket of the DHS. updated 03/12/13 ","Crime - Police"
"Chris Kyle Shot Looters, Carjackers, Punched Jesse Ventura – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/chris-kyle-shot-looters-carjackers-punched-jesse-ventura/"," Former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, the author of “American Sniper,” shot looters in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, shot two carjackers in Texas, and punched Jesse Ventura in the face. "," With the blockbuster success of the film American Sniper, the legacy of former NAVY SEAL Chris Kyle has taken on mythic proportions. As is often the case when this happens, some events of Kyle’s life have been embellished and exaggerated in the re-telling of old stories and accounts. Chris Kyle is the most decorated and revered sniper in American military history and had more than 150 confirmed kills during his time in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kyle’s heroism and service give reason to celebrate his life, however, the public and media often seek even more from legendary figures like Kyle. The truth often blurs in the telling and retelling of legendary figures’ stories, and Kyle is no different. Here’s a look at how some of the most common claims about Kyle got started, and whether or not they’re true: Claims about the historical accuracy of American Sniper – Fiction! Claims about the accuracy of American Sniper are off base. Clint Eastwood, the film’s director, said it portrays one soldier’s perspective of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — not an objective, historically accurate account. The Star reports : “Still, in making American Sniper, which he took over after Steven  Spielberg bowed out due to budget restrictions, Eastwood felt he had  to properly represent Kyle’s version of events. ‘This picture was interesting, because I’m seeing it from the point  of a person who was sort of an American hero, as far as his ability  to be this ultra-sniper. And his family and his beliefs were very  strong about defending the country and defending the guys who are  defending the country, as a sort of an oversight warrior. It was an  important story, but you have to embrace his philosophy if you’re  going to tell a story about him,’ Clint Eastwood said.” Chris Kyle Killed Looters During Hurricane Katrina – Fiction! The claim that Chris Kyle killed 30 looters in New Orleans from a perch on top of the Superdome in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is false. The rumor started after Chris Kyle reportedly told the story to a private group of Navy SEALS after a moderated discussion with SOFREP, a website that covers special-operations forces. The New Yorker reports : “(After the discussion), a larger group went out for dinner, closed  the hotel bar, and hung out in Kyle’s suite, drinking until late.  The SEALs began telling stories, and Kyle offered a shocking one. In  the days after Hurricane Katrina, he said, the law-and-order  situation was dire. He and another sniper travelled to New Orleans,  set up on top of the Superdome, and proceeded to shoot dozens of  armed residents who were contributing to the chaos. Three people  shared with me varied recollections of that evening: the first said  that Kyle claimed to have shot thirty men on his own; according to  the second, the story was that Kyle and the other sniper had shot  thirty men between them; the third said that she couldn’t recall  specific details. A spokesperson for the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) told the New Yorker that “no West Coast SEALs deployed to Katrina.” One of Chris Kyle’s superiors said he’d never heard the story, and he added that it “defies the imagination” to believe that dozens of people were shot with high-velocity rifles and then disappeared. Chris Kyle Killed Two Carjackers in Texas – Fiction! The claim that Chris Kyle killed two carjackers in Texas is false. The account first appeared in D Magazine in April of 2013: “Two guys approached him with pistols and demanded his money and the  keys to his truck. With his hands in the air, he sized up which man  seemed most confident with his gun. He told the robbers that he just needed to reach back into the truck  to get the keys. He turned around and reached under his winter  coat instead, into his waistband. With his right hand, he grabbed  his Colt 1911. He fired two shots under his left armpit, hitting the  first man twice in the chest. Then he turned slightly and fired two  more times, hitting the second man twice in the chest. Both men fell  dead. Kyle leaned on his truck and waited for the police. When they arrived, they detained him while they ran his driver’s  license. But instead of his name, address, and date of birth, what  came up was a phone number at the Department of Defense. At the  other end of the line was someone who explained that the police were  in the presence of one of the most skilled fighters in U.S. military  history. When they reviewed the surveillance footage, the officers  found the incident had happened just as Kyle had described it. They  were very understanding, and they didn’t want to drag a just-home,  highly decorated veteran into a messy legal situation.” D Magazine worked with Chris Kyle on the story, but the writer doesn’t say that Kyle told him the story. In fact, the writer doesn’t say where the account came from. A later article in the New Yorker said Kyle told the story to friends who later retold it to reporters. Either way, the incident likely didn’t happen, the New Yorker reports : “There is cause to be skeptical. The counties of Erath, Somervell,  and Johnson cover the stretch of highway where the incident  supposedly happened. Tommy Bryant, the sheriff of Erath County, told  me that he could ‘guar-an-damn-tee it didn’t happen here.’ Greg  Doyle, the sheriff of Somervell County, said that he had ‘never  heard” the story, which he found “kinda shocking,’ and added, ‘It  did not occur here.’ Bob Alford, the sheriff of Johnson County, told  a local reporter, ‘If something like that happened here I would  have heard of it, and I’m sure you all at the newspaper would  have heard of it.’ “These denials do not automatically disprove the story, of course.  And it’s true that certain operatives, from certain government  offices and agencies, drive government-registered vehicles whose  license plates prompt civilian authorities to contact a call center  in the event of an accident or a traffic stop. But a SEAL with  extensive experience in special-mission units told me that the  notion of such a provision being in place for a former SEAL driving  a private vehicle was ‘bull.’” Chris Kyle Knocked Out Jesse Venture – Fiction! This claim is false, and it landed Chris Kyle’s estate in federal court. In his memoir, Kyle told a story about punching an unnamed celebrity called “Scruff Face” because the celebrity allegedly said that the SEALs “deserved to lose a few” during the war. The Washington Post reports : “Kyle did not identify Ventura by name in the book, but said that he  swung at the individual after he ‘started running his mouth about  the war and everything and anything he could connect to it.’ That  included President George W. Bush and deployed SEALs, who ‘were  doing the wrong thing, killing men and women and children and  murdering,’ the man said, according to Kyle’s book. Ventura said the  whole episode was fabricated. Kyle later said in media interviews while promoting his book that  ‘Scruff Face’ was Ventura, who served in the Navy’s Underwater  Demolition Teams during the Vietnam War era.” Ventura said the incident didn’t happen and sued Chris Kyle and his estate for defamation. At trial, Ventura’s lawyers successfully argued that the made-up fight had drummed up publicity and interest in Kyle’s book, which led to more book sales. Ventura’s lawyers pointed to a picture of Ventura at the event in question that showed no black eye or bruises, which contradicted Kyle’s account of the alleged fight. Witnesses also testified. A jury in Minnesota sided with Ventura and awarded him $1.8 million in July of 2014, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports . Most of the proceeds from the “American Sniper” book were not donated to veterans – Truth! It’s true that the vast majority of royalties generated by the sale of Chris Kyle’s memoirs were not donated to the families of marines in 2013. After Chris Kyle was killed in early 2013, HarperCollins, the publisher of his book, released a statement that said Kyle had “dedicated his life in recent years to supporting veterans and donated the proceeds of American Sniper to the families of his fallen friends.” But Chris Kyle’s widow, Taya, testified in court in July of 2014 that although the couple didn’t intend to profit from the book, they had. The Kyles planned to donate much of the book’s $3 million in royalties to veterans and their families, Taya Kyle said, but they couldn’t because of gift tax laws that prevented them from giving more than $13,000 to each family in 2013. The National Review estimates that $52,000 (or about 2% of American Snipers’ 2013 royalties) had gone to the families of fallen veterans. ","Crime - Police"

"Black Friday Originally Referred to Slave Trade – Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/black-friday-slave-trade/"," The term “Black Friday” originally referred to a day after Thanksgiving sale in which slaves were sold at discounted rates. "," The term “Black Friday” can be traced back to the 1860s, but it was never used to describe a day after Thanksgiving “sale” on enslaved African-Americans. The claim that retailers borrowed “Black Friday” from slave traders lit up social media in both 2013 and 2014. According to the eRumor: “Did you know Black Friday stemmed from slavery? It was the day after Thanksgiving when slave traders would sell slaves for a discount to assist plantation owners with more helpers for the upcoming winter (for cutting and stacking fire wood, winterproofing, etc.)” A number of celebrities fueled the controversy in November of 2014 when they re-posted the message and urged their followers to boycott shopping on Black Friday. In truth, the day after Thanksgiving was first referred to as Black Friday in the early 1950s. It described the rash of employees who called in sick after Thanksgiving to extend their holiday weekend, according to a 1951 column that appeared in the Factory and Maintenance trade publication. According to the column: “’Friday-after-Thanksgiving-itis’ is a disease second only to the bubonic plague in its effects. At least that’s the feeling of those who have to get production out, when the ‘Black Friday’ comes along. The shop may be half empty, but every absentee was sick — and can prove it.” Black Friday was first applied to retail sales in the 1960s — but it was used to deter shoppers, not to encourage them. Philadelphia traffic cops coined the term to warn shoppers about traffic jams and theft brought on by sales and the annual Army-Navy football game held on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Philly.com reports . According to the article: “Today the term seems lost in antiquity, but it was a traffic cop who started it, the guy who directed traffic with a semaphore while standing on a small wooden platform, in the days before traffic lights.” Author and retail scholar Michael Lisicky said the term initially succeeded in scaring shoppers away. However, retailer Peter Strawbridge re-branded it and claimed that Black Friday referred to business profits “going into the black” by the late 1960s. And although the earliest use of Black Friday can be traced back to the 1860s, it didn’t refer to the slave trade. The collapse of the U.S. gold market on September 24, 1869, was widely known at the time as Black Friday, PBS reports . ","Crime - Police"

"The Criminal Kerry Supporter Who Stole a Bush Sign-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:42:36","https://www.truthorfiction.com/signthief/"," The first-hand story of a Bush supporter in the 2004 presidential race  who caught someone stealing a Bush sign from his front yard in Vancouver, Washington. The thief turned out to be driving without a license, using license plates from Oregon illegally, and driving drunk. "," According to the Vancouver Police Department, they’ve gotten inquiries about this one, but it never happened. This story is an example of a fictional tale being created by someone who didn’t think it through. How many people would post a campaign sign in their front yard then decide to stay up late to conduct surveillance on it? Also, the writer describes the car as being “nice” and having “power everything.” In most late-model car, the doors would not lock while the ignition is on and the engine running. Additionally, for the man to have been arrested for drunk driving, someone would have had to observe him committing the crime. Being intoxicated in the vicinity of your locked car is not illegal. That and other aspects of the story seem more like the way the writer wished they would be than the way they really were. It was an attempt to characterize people who support a different political candidate as drunken criminals. Last updated 10/4/04 ","Crime - Police"
"Good things in Iraq not being reported-Truth!, Fiction!, and Unproven!","2015-03-17 20:42:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rayreynolds/"," A message said to be from an Iowa Army National Guardsman named Ray Reynolds who is serving in Iraq. It lists a number of improvements in Iraq since the U.S. led incursion in 2003. "," This message began circulating on the Internet in April, 2004. It’s a passionate email from a soldier serving in Iraq about some of the good things that are happening as a result of the U.S.-led incursion. We checked into each one of his statements and some were accurate, some were not. Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations – Truth! But his figure is low! According to a UNICEF report at the end of 2003, more than 3 1/2 million children had been immunized. School Attendance is up 80%- Truth! Again, according to an April, 2004 report from UNICEF, school attendance in Iraq increased by 60 percent shortly after the war to more than 95 percent during the recent national exam week. More than 1,500 schools renovated- Truth! UNICEF says that as of April, 2004, more than 2,500 schools have been renovated with the goal of 4,000 being completed by the end of the year, but 10,000 more need repair. The Port of Uhm Qasar [sic] renovated so grain can be offloaded faster- Truth! In a November, 2003 interview on National Public Radio, Andrew Natsios of the U.S. Agency for International Development said that the port at Umm Qasar, Iraq’s largest, is modern and functioning for the first time in 20 years. Iraqi oil reached 2 billion barrels exported in August of 2003- Fiction! Iraq sits on the second largest proven crude oil reserves in the world and the flow of oil resumed in August, 2003 amid equipment that needed repair and suffered from looting and attacks from saboteurs. The initial flow in August, 2003, was 500,000 barrels per day, according to the BBC. Iraqi oil is subject to the ups and downs of the crude oil market but in April, 2003, more than 2 million barrels a day were being produced, but that has not accumulated to 2 billion. Clean drinking water for the first time for than 4.5 million Iraqis- Fiction! According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, safe drinking water was not widespread in Iraq before the U.S. led coalition invaded Iraq but that was partly because of water treatment systems that were in disrepair or had been looted. In other words, clean water is not new to Iraq. We couldn’t find any figures that indicated how many would be receiving clean water for the first time. In December, 2003, USAID was on track to provide clean water to more than 14 million Iraqis. Iraq has twice the electrical power than before the war- Fiction! USAID says power was restored in October, 2003 to slightly more than pre-war levels, or more than 4500 MW as opposed to about 4400 MW prior to the war. The goal was to reach 6000 MW by the summer of 2004. All of the hospitals operating- Truth! Because of disrepair and looting, it took a lot of work to get hospitals back up to speed but according to James Haverman, the Coalition Provisional Authority Senior Advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, all 240 hospitals in Iraq as well as 2400 primary health care clinics were operating as of December, 2003. Elections taking place in all major cities- Fiction! This has been a source of contention in Iraq. In June of 2003 U.S. authorities called halts to local elections across Iraq and chose to put hand-chosen mayors or administrators into office. There have been various local elections since that time and debate over whether Iraq is ready for national elections. According to the Army New Service, there were three truly democratic elections by the end of 2003 in the cities of Tallafar, Zumar and Al-Eyaldia in northern Iraq. Sewer and water lines installed in every major city- Unproven! We’re not sure about all the major cities, but according to USAID, the water and sewage in Iraq has been suffering from years of neglect, electricity shortages, and post-war looting. Work is underway to restore healthy water and sewage treatment to more than 14-million Iraqis. More than 60,000 police in the streets, more than 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police securing the country, and 80,000 Iraqi soldiers patrolling the streets with the U.S. soldiers- Mostly Fiction! All accounts regarding the Iraqi police say that the goal is to have 35,000 to 50,000 trained and in place by 2005 or 2006, according to the U.S. State Department. The first class of more than 400 police offers graduated in January, 2004. The Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) is composed of Iraqis who remain citizens, as opposed to serving full time in the military, and are integrated into the coalition military units. The internal defense of the country is in their hands and they are led by the coalition. According to There were about 25,000 hired and trained by February, 2004. The first Iraqi Army battalion of 700 soldiers graduated in October of 2003. By February of 2004, 3,500 had been recruited, about 2000 of those being operational. Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever- Unproven! We’ve not found any statistics regarding how many new customers there will be for telephones. Most of the work in Iraq has been to restore telephone communications that were lost because of damage from the war. An interim constitution has been signed- Truth! On March 8, 2004, an interim constitution that defines Iraq as being “federal, democratic and pluralist” was signed by members of the Iraqi Governing Council. Girls are allowed to attend school- Truth! But Misleading! A quick read of Sgt. Reynolds’ report would leave the impression that Iraqi girls are able to attend school for the first time because of the invasion. According to Human Rights Watch, Iraqi girls and women have enjoyed comparatively more rights than in some of the other countries of the Middle East. The Iraqi Constitution of 1970 included women’s rights for voting, attending school, owning property, and running for office. Still, the status of women in Iraq has not always been the best because of other cultural and economic factors such as the aftermath of the 1991 war and economic sanctions. School attendance for girls has not been prohibited although more boys than girls have been enrolled, especially in rural areas. Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs- Truth! Not only are U.S. soldiers demonstrating field sanitation and hand washing, but UNICEF is conducting an active health education program to improve personal hygiene and promote more hand washing. Textbooks that don’t mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years- Truth! According to published reports, a team of U.S. appointed Iraqi educators combed through more than 500 Iraqi textbooks and removed every mention of Saddam Hussein and the Baath party including pictures. The texts will probably be revised by the Iraqis at some point in the future, but the pre-war texts were dominated with Saddam Hussein. Last updated 4/24/04 ","Crime - Police"

It describes the arrest of a group of Christians who were preaching on a public sidewalk near OUTFEST, a homosexual event. They were surrounded by a group known as PINK ANGELS who tried to counter the Christians’ preaching. The Christians were arrested and charged with a variety of crimes. "," On October 4, 2004, there was an       event in Philadelphia known as Outfest. It is sponsored by Philly Pride Presents which also sponsors PrideDay in June and WinterPride in Winter. They are described as occasions during which lesbian, gay,       bi-sexual, and transgender communities come together to celebrate as       a whole and are designed to advance rights for the communities. Under the sponsorship of a group called Repent America several Christians appeared near the event preaching, praying, and       reading scripture. Their efforts were countered by a group known as The Pink Angels . Supporters of the Christians say they were operating within their       constitutional right of free speech on public property and that it       was the Pink Angels who violated their rights. Eleven of the Christians were arrested, but charges against 7 of       then were later dropped. As of this writing, four of them are headed for trial on charges of       “criminal conspiracy, ethnic intimidation, and riot.” They have also been banned from doing evangelism within 100 yard of       any gay and lesbian event. City officials say one of the Christians tried to interrupt a       performance at Outfest with his preaching and that the group       disobeyed a police order to move to the perimeter of Outfest to       avoid violence. Brian Fahling, the attorney representing the Christians says the       video tape does not show what the city alleges and, in fact, proves       that the Christians were operating within their rights.

As she ran down a road, she encountered a pride of lions who reportedly protected her until she stopped crying then let police tend to her. "," Reports from remote areas of the       world are sometimes unreliable, but there are published stories       about this one. A BBC article from June 22, 2005 quotes police in West Ethiopia as       saying that the story is true. Sergeant Wondmu Wedaj from Bita Genet told the BBC that the lions       stood guard until the police got there then “left her like a       gift” and went back into the forest. The article quotes lion experts as being skeptical about that,       however, and suggest that the lion was actually preparing to eat the       girl but scattered when the police showed up. One animal expert also  told reporters that the lions may have       spared the girl because her crying may have sounded like the mewing       sound from a lion cub.

"," If you ever find yourself in the       midst of a natural disaster or other crisis that affects a large       number of people, brace yourself for rumors. Whether they start because of sincere misinformation or because of       intentional misinformation, they can spread like wildfire,       especially during a time when other types of communication are not       working. These stories about the hurricane survivors were reported through       several media including being repeated by survivors interviewed on       television. Most of them believed the stories and repeated them as truth. The story about rapes, killings, and the slitting of two children’s       throats was also reported in an article in the Guardian of London on       September 5. They quoted witnesses as saying, “During this time, they said,       girls and boys were raped in the dark and had their throats cut and       bodies were stuffed in the kitchens while looters and madmen       exchanged fire with weapons they had looted.” TruthOrFiction.com has checked with New Orleans police. They say they’ve not been able to confirm the story of the babies       with the throats cut or even any rapes from among those who took       refuge in the Superdome. If those events did happen, nobody has come forward to report them       or substantiate them. One rumor that spread through the refugees was that a       7-year-old-girl had been raped and killed, but there has not been       any evidence found so far of that murder. The London Guardian ran a story on September 6 saying that they,       too, have not been able to confirm any of the rape and killing       stories or the stories of bodies stacked in the kitchen at the       Superdome.

One version that came up in 2005 says that September 23 and 24 are “blood initiation weekend” and that police departments across the nation are being warned to stay on the alert.

One widely circulated version of the eRumor came from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2004 but it has reappeared on a regular basis.  The     email is signed by Orle Howat, Compensation Advisor for the RCMP.      A call to her phone number on the email, however, brought up a voice     mail that said the story was an urban legend and to not take it     seriously.  The RCMP later issued a release saying that “One of our Saskatchewan employees sent this e-mail on to others in good faith without realizing it was untrue. The information contained in the e-mail is FALSE and the RCMP regrets any unnecessary alarm this may have caused the public.” There have been seasons when this eRumor has become so widely circulated that even police departments and government agencies have posted it without realizing it is not true or have had so many citizen reports of the hoax that they’ve braced themselves for dealing with the rumor itself.  According to an article in the Houston Chronicle in September of 2003, officers in Houston and Harris county were on alert one weekend because of warnings of the gang/headlight initiation.  In 1993 police in Wichita, Kansas, thought they had a shooting that may have been prompted by the the rumor.

Some Canadian versions of the story say the number to call is #677. "," Whether this particular story is real, we don’t know, but the information it conveys is apparently sound. TruthOrFiction.com talked with law enforcement agencies on both the East and West Coasts. The consensus was that if you are suspicious about a patrol car wanting to pull you over, especially in an isolated area or at night, it’s prudent to proceed to a place where would feel safer. The problem is that the law says you are to obey an officer who says to pull over so if you do decide to continue, do so in a way that makes it clear you are not trying to evade him or her. If you have a cell phone, call your local emergency number, usually 911, and you can be connected to a dispatcher who can help decide whether the car attempting to pull you over is legitimate. Also, as happens in this eRumor, you can inform the dispatcher that it is your intention to comply, but only after you get to the next off ramp, gas station, populated areas, etc. We’ve received numerous emails asking about the #77 procedure described in the eRumor. Even though 911 is the most common   number to use in an emergency, there are many states that have   established other numbers as well for cell phone users, especially   to report highway emergencies. The #77 number is one   of them.  Some states use *77 or even #55. The story that suggests using #677 is a Canadian version of this eRumor that inserted the numbers for reaching the Ontario Provincial Police in Ontario. One of the   reasons, according to a cell company we spoke with, is that the   911 calls from a cell phone go to different kinds of agencies   depending on where the phone call is being made. In some   areas, dialing 911 on a cell phone may go to a city or county   emergency dispatcher.  In other  areas, the call may go   to a state highway law enforcement agency such as the highway   patrol or state troopers. In the states with the   “77” numbers, cell phone users will usually get   connected directly with a highway law enforcement agency. For that reason, you will frequently see signs posted along some   freeways, expressways, or toll ways suggesting use of a number   other than 911 if you’re using a cell phone. ","Crime - Police"

The Bronco was driven by Simpson’s friend and fellow athlete Al Cowlings.  Simpson was finally taken into custody when they returned in the Bronco to his home in Brentwood on the west side of the Los Angeles area.  Although Cowlings claimed that he was taken hostage at gun point and forced to take part in the famous low speed pursuit by Simpson he was charged with aiding a fugitive and released on bail. O.J. Simpson’s highly publicized trial resulted in his being found not guilty. He later lost a civil suit filed by the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and was ordered to pay restitution for their deaths. updated 01/15/11 ","Crime - Police"
"The faith of Atlanta hostage Ashley Smith-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:42:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ashley-smith/"," The dramatic story of Ashley Smith who was held hostage in Atlanta, Georgia by an accused rapist and fugitive from the law who police say killed four people during his run from the law. "," This story is a first for TruthOrFiction.com. There is no eRumor circulating that we know of about Ashley Smith, but thousands of people have come to TruthOrFiction.com and used our search engine to try to find her name and, presumably, the truth of her story. We’ve drawn from a story from Assist News Service to provide the details. ASSIST News Service (ANS) – PO Box 2126, Garden Grove, CA 92842-2126 USA Visit our website at: www.assistnews.net — E-mail: danjuma1@aol.com Thursday, March 17, 2005 ASHLEY SMITH’S FAITH AND CALMNESS LED TO NICHOLS SURRENDER She Believes God Brought Him to Her Door By Ginny Johnston/Associated Press/CNN Special to ASSIST News Service ATLANTA, GA (ANS) — Ashley Smith, the women held hostage in her apartment by the Brian Nichols, the suspect Atlanta’s courthouse killings, said during the time she was held captive, she talked to him about her faith and trust in God, read to him from Pastor Rick Warren’s best-selling book, “Purpose Driven Life,” which is currently selling about a million copies a month. (Pictured: Purpose Driven Life book cover). Smith, a 26-year-old waitress, mother and student said she calmly talked to Nichols, turning from hostage to confidant as they discussed God, family and pancakes, along with the massive manhunt going on outside her apartment. (Pictured: Ashley Smith, 26, of Atlanta recounts her hostage experience with murder suspect Brian Nichols during an interview in Atlanta Sunday – AP/Atlanta Journal Constitution, Curtis Compton). “I believe God brought him to my door,” Smith said just hours after her 911 call ended a manhunt for Nichols, who is accused of killing four people and wounding a fifth. Smith said Nichols, 33, took her hostage in the parking lot outside her apartment when she returned from a store about 2 a.m. “He said, ‘I’m not going to hurt you if you just do what I say,’ ” she said. ” ‘I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt anybody else.’ “She said Nichols tied her up with masking tape, a curtain and extension cord and told her to sit in the bathroom while he took a shower. “I thought he was going to strangle me,” she said. Though her ordeal began with Nichols sticking a gun in her side and tying her up, it ended with the weapons on the floor, as he let her go to see her young daughter. After hours of talking about the killings, their families and God, Smith said Nichols just wanted to be normal. “I honestly think when I looked at him that he didn’t want to do it anymore,” Smith said in a statement televised on CNN. If he did not give up, she told him, “lots more people are probably going to get hurt, and you’re probably going to die.” During the night, Smith had gradually earned his trust and the two were able to relate about family matters. “I told him I was supposed to see my little girl the next morning at 10,” Smith said. “I asked him if I could go and he said no.” The situation also stirred emotion in the young mother. Choking back tears, she said she told Nichols that her husband died four years ago and that if he hurt her, her daughter would not have a mother or father. Eventually he untied her, and some of the fear lessened as they talked. Nichols told Smith he felt like “he was already dead,” but Smith encouraged him to consider the fact that he was still alive a “miracle.” “You’re here in my apartment for some reason,” she told him, saying he might be destined to be caught and to spread the word of God to fellow prisoners. Smith called 911 after she was freed, and police quickly surrounded her suburban apartment complex. When authorities arrived at the scene, Nichols gave up peacefully, waving a white towel in surrender, after Smith had convinced him to give up. Nichols allegedly overpowered a courthouse deputy who was escorting him to his rape trial Friday and took the deputy’s gun, then entered the courtroom where his trial was being held and killed the presiding judge and court stenographer. He also is accused of killing a deputy who tried to stop him outside the courthouse and a federal agent during his flight from authorities. Since his surrender and arrest, Nichols went before a judge on Tuesday, and was told that he now faces murder charges for the crime spree that left an Atlanta judge and three others dead. He remained calm and only spoke once in the court as the judge asked him if he had any questions. “Not at this time,” said Nichols. He had been in federal custody since his arrest on a federal firearms charge. But officials announced Monday that the charge had been dropped so he could be handed over to Fulton County authorities, who will likely be the first to prosecute him. Nineteen officers accompanied Nichols inside the cinderblock jail room on Tuesday at Fulton County Jail, as he went before the judge, his hands and ankles shackled as he was informed that authorities plan to charge him with murder. He faces federal and state charges in the deaths of a judge, a court reporter, a deputy and a federal agent. Prosecutors will likely decide within 30 days what new charges to file, said Fulton County district attorney’s spokesman Erik Friedly. Nichols was being retried for rape and other charges when he escaped on Friday. That case was declared a mistrial Monday at the request of Nichols’ attorney, Friedly said. Barry Hazen, Nichols’ attorney on the rape charge, has said continuing with that earlier case would be a waste of time and tax dollars. “He’s facing four homicide charges that could carry the death penalty. In the best-case scenario, he’s in jail for life. What’s the point?” Hazen said Sunday.

"Obama’s 32 Month Report Card-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-report-card/"," A forwarded email with what the author calls the many “firsts” of President Barack Obama. "," This eRumor appeared all over the Internet in November, 2011 and on various political web sites but it was not found on any major news sites. The email says only that is was authored by someone named Rich Carroll but does not identify him beyond that. Let us look some of the topics in the article one at a time: First President to refuse to show a valid birth certificate – Disputed ! Although there are those who dispute its validity, candidate Obama released  of his birth certificate in 2008 and it was displayed on his Fight the Smears web site when questions about his citizenship were raised.   Critics alleged that the document was a fake, or insufficient as proof for the office of the President. This stirred a frenzy of rumors including emails that contained faked documents including one made up to look like birth certificates from Kenya. Tow years later, in 2010, President Obama released what he said was his original long form birth certificate, from the state of Hawaii.. We have a page on the questionable citizenship of Barack Obama complete with photos of documents. Click for our findings. First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner- Fiction! This rumor originated from an April Fools Joke in 2009 featuring an alleged Associated Press story that said that Barack Obama received a grant from the “Fulbright Foundation” when he attended Occidental College in California.  There is no “Fulbright Foundation” but there is a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the US Department of State and does award scholarship grants to students working towards higher degrees who already have a Bachelor of Arts degree. Click for our Findings First President to have a social security number from a state he has never lived in- Fiction! Rumors about Obama’s Social Security Number began circulating in 2010 alleging that the number belonged to a deceased man who immigrated to the U.S. from France and resided in Hawaii.   That proved to be fiction.   This sparked additional inquires as to why the President’s Social Security Number began with 042, the three digit classification for Connecticut.   According to the Social Security Administration, “The Area Number is assigned by the geographical region. Prior to 1972, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the Area Number represented the State in which the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be the State where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office.” Click for Social Security site First President to preside over a cut to the credit rating of the United States. – Truth! On August 5, 2011, for the first time in the history of this nation, Standard and Poor’s downgraded the US Credit Rating to one notch below AAA.  According to a Washington Post article dated that same day, “the credit rating company said ‘political brinkmanship’ in the debate over the debt had made the U.S. government’s ability to manage its finances ‘less stable, less effective and less predictable.’ It said the bipartisan agreement reached this week to find at least $2.1 trillion in budget savings ‘fell short’ of what was necessary to tame the nation’s debt over time and predicted that leaders would not be likely to achieve more savings in the future.” First President to violate the War Powers Act – Fiction! The War Powers Resolution of 1973 became federal law to prevent a president from committing the United States to an armed conflict without the approval from Congress. This law requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing  U.S. armed forces to military action.   It also limits U.S. involvement to no more than 60 days.  In 2011 President Obama bypassed congressional approval for going into Libya, but he was not the first U.S. President to do so. The War Powers Resolution was first disregarded by President Clinton in 1999, during the bombing campaign in Kosovo. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. – Truth! The President did order a moratorium on offshore drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet after the Deepwater Horizon Spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. The moratorium was struck down by New Orleans Judge Martin Feldman and according to a February 3, 2011 article in Bloomberg the Obama Administration was acting in contempt by continuing the policy.  Felman’s comments on the ruling were reported in the article.  He said, “Each step the government took following the court’s imposition of a preliminary injunction showcases its defiance.”  Feldman added, “Such dismissive conduct, viewed in tandem with the re-imposition of a second blanket and substantively identical moratorium, and in light of the national importance of this case, provide this court with clear and convincing evidence of the government’s contempt.” First President to defy a Federal Judges court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.- Fiction! The constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been questioned by several courts in various states in the US since it was passed into law in March 21, 2010.  According to an August 12, 2011 article in Reuters a U.S. Appeals Court for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta ruled that it was unconstitutional to require all Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty but it unanimously reversed a lower court decision that threw out the entire law. First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. If the writer of the eRumor had in mind the Affordable Care Act then this would be Truth! .  When the law makers wrote the HR-3590 bill,  the Democratic majority House and Senate quickly passed it and the President signed it into law. It is doubtful that anybody in government who supported this bill actually read it,  Buried inside the 2409 pages of the “Obamacare” law there is a stipulation known as the “Individual Mandate,” where the Internal Revenue Service will collect a 2.5% penalty from tax returns not showing proof of enrollment of health insurance. First President to spend a trillion dollars on shovel-ready jobs and later admit there was no such thing as shovel-ready jobs.- Inaccurate! According to a September 26, 2011 article in Politico , President Obama did use the term “Shovel Ready Jobs” in a plan to fund $50 billion in improvements to highways, transit systems, railways and aviation. The idea was to put Americans back to work by construction upgrades to  150,000 miles of road, 4,000 miles of train tracks, 150 miles of airport runways and the nation’s air traffic control system. Political reported that experts did not see the jobs being as shovel ready as one would think as ” A tremendous amount of money and time is needed to get a project through a detailed design process, permitting, environmental hurdles, public hearings and land acquisition.” First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.- Under Investigation First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.

First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S. , including those with criminal convictions- Fiction! This was not done is secret and according to an August 18, 2011 ABC News report , “ The Obama administration announced a major change in policy for thousands of illegal immigrants going through deportation proceedings. They now may be able to stay in the country. There are currently 300,000 deportation cases making their way through the federal immigration courts, but under the new policy immigrants classified as low-priority cases could be granted a stay and a chance to apply for a work permit.” First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. – Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to terminate Americas ability to put a man in space. Fiction! According to the St. Petersburg Times PolitiFact Check site, “Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of “first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space” — not Obama.”  The Apollo program ended in 1975 and had a five year gap in space launches until the Space Shuttle program was in full operation. First President to encourage racial discrimination and intimidation at polling places. – Unproven! On November 4, 2008 Black Panthers were spotted outside a polling place in Philadelphia, PA.  One of the Black Panthers was holding a night stick.   A YouTube Video taken by a local journalism student of an account with them went viral on the Internet and news outlets.  A short time later, police arrived on the scene and they were removed from the scene.  Charges of voter intimidation were charged but they were dropped by the Justice Department under the leadership of Eric Holder, according to an August 20, 2009  article in the Wall Street Journal.  No explanation was given by Holder or anyone at the Department of Justice.  The accusation that the President encouraged this incident remains unproven. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.- Truth! According to a May 22, 2011 article in the New York Times this was a historical first when the President extended the Patriot Act by autopen during a weeklong trip in Europe. First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.- Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly speak-out on the reasons for their rate increases.- Under Investigation First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state they are allowed to locate a factory.- Truth! On April 20, 2011 the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint against the Boeing claiming that the aircraft manufacturer opened up a second 787 Dreamliner production line in South Carolina in retaliation against the union.  South Carolina is a “right to work state.” On  September 23, 2011 Politico.com reported that , “An Obama appointee is now asking a judge to order Boeing to relocate all 787 Dreamliner production to Washington state — a move that’s feeding the GOP narrative that Obama’s Big Government is meddling with job creation, just as the first plane nears its first commercial flight.” First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN)- Fiction! The oath of the President of the United States does not have any conditions to protect U.S. States.   The oath of office is in the U.S. Constitution and it says, “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” First President to withdraw an existing coal permit that had been properly issued years ago.- Under Investigation First President to fire an inspector general of Ameri-corps for catching one of his friends in a corruption case.- Under Investigation First President to appoint 45 Czars to replace elected officials in his office.- Under Investigation First President to golf 73 separate times in his first two and a half years in office.- Inaccurate! According to a June 26, 2011 White House Dossier article, written by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler, President Obama played his 75th golf game since being sworn into office.  No doubt at the time of this writing the number is greater. According to an October 24, 2009 article in Politico , Obama was in office about 10 months when he played his 24th golf game, tying his predecessor, G. W. Bush, for the number of golf games.  It took Bush almost 3 years to play that number of games. First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records . – Fiction! There are no U.S. laws stating that a U.S. President or presidential candidate disclose his medical or educational background.   In his books, Barack Obama wrote about his life in Indonesia.  Questions about Obama’s travels could have been sparked by a  rumor that was spread on YouTube by Reverend James Manning of the ATLAH church in Harlem.  Manning alleged that Obama, while attending Columbia University (Class of 1983), was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to be the operative in an arms deal with the Taliban. Manning said that Obama was selected because he was fluent in Farsi and Middle Eastern customs.   President only speaks English fluently, has never learned Farsi and the Taliban did not exist until 1989. First President to win a Nobel Peace Prize for doing NOTHING to earn it. Disputed! The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Barack Obama on October 9, 2009 after he had been in office approximately 9 months. According to the Nobel Peace Prize website Obama was awarded this, “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”.  On January 20, 2010 Britain’s The Guardian released a timeline showing the major events during the President’s fist year in office.    In April 2009, Obama flew to England for the G-20 conference where he not only met with Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Gordon Brown but also met with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to discuss U.S. and Russian relations. First President to coddle American enemies while alienating Americas allies- Too Vague to investigate. We are not sure of what policy this is related to. First President to publicly bow to Americas enemies while refusing to salute the U.S. Flag. Fiction! President Obama has been photographed bowing to foreign leaders during formal introductions.  One of these leaders was Saudi Arabian King Abdullah.  The U.S. is at war with a radical terrorist organization based in the Middle East called al-Queda, and neither Saudi Arabia or King Abdullah are considered an enemy of the U.S.   Obama does not always follow the protocol of placing his hand over his heart when the National Anthem is played. Click for Findings on the bow. Click for findings on the salute. First President to go on multiple global apology tours.- Disputed! Obama did travel overseas and during his speeches make apologies for past American policies and arrogance.  Former George W. Bush campaign manager, Karl Rove wrote an opinion on April 23, 2009 in the Wall Street Journal calling the Presidents trip an “Apology Tour”. In a  June 17, 2009 Human Events article, attributed to Niles Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative newspaper listed ten apologies by President Obama: 1 . Apology to Europe: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In America, there’s a failure to appreciate Europe‘s leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.” 2. Apology to the Muslim world: Interview with Al Arabiya, January 27. “My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect.” 3. Apology to the Summit of the Americas: Address to the Summit of the Americas, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, April 17. “While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms.” 4. Apology at the G-20 Summit of World Leaders: News conference in London, April 2. “I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.” 5. Apology for the War on Terror: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight, that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.” 6. Apology for Guantanamo in France: Speech in Strasbourg, France, April 3. “In dealing with terrorism, we can’t lose sight of our values and who we are. That’s why I closed Guantanamo. That’s why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogation practices. I don’t believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when you start sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.” 7. Apology for America before the Turkish Parliament: Speech to the Turkish Parliament, Ankara, Turkey, April 6. “The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.” 8. Apology for U.S. Policy toward the Americas: Editorial “Choosing a Better Future in the Americas,” April 16. “Too often, the United States has not pursued and sustained engagement with our neighbors. We have been too easily distracted by other priorities, and have failed to see that our own progress is tied directly to progress throughout the Americas.” 9. Apology for the Mistakes of the CIA: Remarks to CIA employees at Langley, Va., April 29. “Don’t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we’ve made some mistakes.” 10. Apology for Guantanamo: Speech in Washington, D.C., May 21. “There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America’s strongest currency in the world.” On the other hand, The FactChecker at the Washington Post said on February 22, 2011, that they “concluded that ‘the claim that Obama repeatedly has apologized for the United States is not borne out by the fact, especially if his full quotes are viewed in context.'”  They claim that the apology tour never happened.

I’m a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk. As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their Muslim faith.” There was no mention in this speech that the Azaan was the most beautiful sound to Obama’s ears.

"Zim Ship Blockade in Port of Long Beach-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:43","https://www.truthorfiction.com/israeli-zim-ship-blockade/"," Warnings on the Internet allege that a group of Palestinian sympathizers have organized a blockade of an Israeli Zim ship entering the Port of Long Beach, CA. "," A spokesperson for the Port of Long Beach told the TruthOrFiction.com team that on the morning of August 13, 2014, there was a peaceful protest by a group of less than 50 demonstrators outside the port entrance, but there was no attempt of a blockade, nor disruption of business. The protest began about 7a.m., lasted about two hours without incident, and afterwards the demonstrator left peacefully. This actually occurred near the location of one of our TruthOrFiction.com team members who is an avid sailor and very familiar with the facilities and waters around the Port of Long Beach. After the attack on America on September 11, 2001, security in our nation’s ports have been greatly enhanced. According to the Port of Long Beach website , nobody is permitted unescorted access within the port facilities without completing the necessary steps to obtain a Transportation Workers Identification Credential (TWIC). Also, a blockade from the water would not be an easy operation because the waters in the port are restricted only to commercial traffic. Private or recreational vessels in restricted waters are immediately reported by surveillance teams to the harbor police and U.S. Coast Guard. There was a blockade on Saturday, August 17, 2014, according to an August 18th. article by Britain’s Guardian a Zim cargo container was delayed when 2,000 and 3,000 pro-Palestinian activists gathered at the port entrance in Oakland, Ca. Once the ship was docked, the article said that the “protesters intended to form a picket line to prevent work crews from unloading the ship.” Posted 08/15/14 ","Crime - Police"
"Secret government spying on laptops?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:41","https://www.truthorfiction.com/homeland-security-logger/"," The eRumor says it’s from the “Turner Radio Network” and claims that the author of the email has caught the government and computer manufacturers installing hard-wired keystroke loggers on new laptop computers. The message includes pictures and descriptions of a device that was found in a laptop. The email claims that an inquiry to the police resulted in his being referred to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. A call to them resulted in his being told to make a request under the Freedom of Information Security Act. That resulted in a letter from Homeland Security saying the information he requested did not have to be revealed and he could appeal by writing to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Some versions of the eRumor say it is Dell that is selling the laptops with loggers on them. "," TruthOrFiction.com is declaring this to be a hoax. Most hoaxes of this nature have been quickly created with pictures and other resources found on the Internet. We did some searching and, surely enough, we found the original pictures of both the scanned letter from Homeland Security and the pictures of the alleged laptop keylogging device. First, there is such a device as a keylogger.  It’s a small piece of equipment that you can attach to your computer keyboard that keeps track of every character you type.  Some people use them as a back-up so they can retrieve what they’ve typed in case of a computer crash.  Others have them on their keyboards so they can tell whether someone else has been using their computer and for what purpose.  There are also companies that have installed keyloggers on various corporate computers for purposes of security.  There are also more controversial uses for keyloggers such as spying on other people and law enforcment is said to use them for that. One of the products that is sold to the consumer is called KeyGhost and is made in New Zealand.  There is a small, visible version that you simply install between your computer and your keyboard.  There is also a version that looks so much like a normal keyboard cable that you don’t know that it’s there. There is also a version of KeyGhost that is installed inside of desktop keyboards and is not visible.  The information is actually stored in the KeyGhost and you can download it later on any computer.  There is also a version that can send the keylogger information over the Internet to a different location. The pictures of the keylogger used in the eRumor were taken from an article about keyloggers posted on the KeyGhost website at www.keyghost.com. The letter from Homeland Security used in the eRumor is a hoax. You’ll  notice that the letter says it is regarding “File Number 20050112-20050119.”  Those are the file numbers listed on a scan of a letter from Homeland Security to Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and it had nothing to do with keylogging.  She was requesting documents about White House security procedures and the Secret Service.  The creator of this hoax found a scan of that letter on the Internet then doctored it with the alleged response about being denied access to his files.

"Flower and Wine Credit Card Scam-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:39:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/flower-wine-scam/"," This is a forwarded email that warns of a gift of flowers and wine that are delivered by a fake courier.  The email alleged of a scam after a request for a credit card to pay for a delivery verification charge of $3.50, which resulted in $4000 in charges to the stolen credit card number.  Some versions of the eRumor say that the fake delivery man identified himself with a company called “Express Couriers.” "," The scam is real, but it is old and we have not found any evidence of this taking place in the U.S. Back in 2008, there was such a scam in Australia according to a November 23, 2008 article in Sydney Morning Herald.   The article said, David John Hennessey was caught by police and “charged with stealing more than $30,000 by posing as a delivery man bearing wine and flowers.” The Modus operandi of Hennessey was exactly the same as the eRumor.  The Herald reported, “Before the victims received the package they were told they needed to swipe their credit cards to pay a delivery fee of $3.50. Police allege that in all cases those involved swiped their credit card into a hand-held machine and were given a receipt for their payment.”  Hennessey was held without bail and had 10 counts charged against him of “obtaining benefit by deception and one count of having stolen goods in his possession.” It is not known if there have been any copy cat incidents in the U.S.  On February 6, 2013 the Ann Arbor News published an article that warned  of a Sheriff’s Office alert of “a person delivering a gift of flowers and wine may ask the recipient to use a credit or debit card to pay a $3.50 delivery charge. ‘Paying’ with the card allows the scammer to steal the victim’s account information and then use it to get money at ATMs.” The Ann Arbor news said that the spokesperson for the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office called the alert a “heads up” and said his department had not received any reports of any local attempts.

"Former Marine Arrested in Crack Down on Anti-Government Commenters -Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/former-marine-arrested/"," Forwarded emails claim that a former Marine was detained for making anti-government comments on social media, and that the case proves there is a larger government effort to crackdown on government critics. "," It’s true that a former Marine was held for psychiatric evaluation after authorities were tipped-off about cryptic anti-government Facebook posts he made. The case doesn’t, however, prove that a larger crackdown on people who post anti-government comments on social media sites is underway. Police from Chesterfield, Virginia, detained former Marine Brandon Raub for a mental health evaluation on August 16, 2012. Police and FBI agents had been dispatched to Raub’s home to investigate a complaint that his Facebook posts had grown increasingly dark. Chesterfield Police said county mental health crisis intervention workers determined that Raub should be held under a temporary detention order and taken to a hospital for further evaluation based on his interactions with police. Raub was held in psychiatric care until a county judge ordered his release on August 23, 2012. In his ruling, the judge said Raub had suffered “a deprivation of liberty,” an NBC News affiliate reports . No criminal charges were filed in the case. In May 2013, attorneys for the Rutherford Institute, an organization that says it defends civil liberties, filed a civil lawsuit on Raub’s behalf. The lawsuit sought damages for alleged violations of Raub’s First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In March 2014, a federal judge dismissed the case and said mental health workers had acted reasonably in recommending Raub’s detention, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports . Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute appealed the decision in August 2014. The appeal says a former Marine who served with Raub in Iraq had tipped-off authorities about Raub’s Facebook posts. Some of the posts called for the arrests of President George W. Bush and President H.W. Bush and claimed that the U.S. government had orchestrated 9/11. Raub also talked about how revolution could lead to the former presidents’ demise. Another passage that drew attention stated, “Sharpen up my axe; I’m here to severe heads.” Raub later argued that the passage was intended to be “metaphorical” and said it was a song lyric. Authorities determined that Raub’s messages didn’t include specific threats of violence and didn’t rise to a criminal level. The eRumor’s claims about a larger ant-government crackdown may be based on “Operation Vigilant Eagle.” The FBI launched the program in April 2009 to target white supremacists and “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” including veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, the Wall Street Journal reports . FBI memos stated that the Vigilant Eagle program was designed to “share information regarding Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans whose involvement in white supremacy and/or militia sovereign citizen extremist groups poses a domestic terrorism threat.” However, the FBI didn’t detain Raub as part of Vigilant Eagle. Local authorities ordered Raub held for psychiatric evaluation based on his interactions with police, not based on his Facebook posts. Posted 10/31/14 ","Crime - Police"

In this case 15-year old Evan Trembley is real, however, and a television station in Wichita Falls, Texas, says he’s the one responsible for the forwarded email.  He created it as a joke to send to his friends and now he’s what we call an unintended  Internet celebrity.

"Lock your car manually, not with the wireless remote-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/carlock/"," This is a warning that crooks can get the code to the wireless locking system on your car.  The email claims it happened to someone in Canada.  While stopped at a roadside park, a man’s locked car was easily accessed by someone who stole his cell phone, laptop, GPS, briefcase, and more.  The police allegedly said that robbers were using a device that would clone the security code on the wireless remote that is used for locking and unlocking the car. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not found any documented case of a car being broken into by thieves using an electronic cloning device to duplicate the code of a wireless remote. This eRumor, which began circulating in July, 2008, does not include any information about when, where, and to whom this event occurred. The experts we consulted says that at the present time, such a criminal event could not happen with most cars. Virtually all of the cars that unlock with remote keyless devices are protected by an encryption system called Keelog, which scrambles the wireless transmissions so nobody could monitor and clone them. According to MSNBC blogger Bob Sullivan, there is a group of researchers in Israel and Belgium who claim to have discovered a way to figure out the coding of a wireless locking system, but it’s fairly time consuming and is not being used by thieves. This eRumor may have been sparked by the memory of some of the original keyless systems first introduced in the 1980s.  They were simpler and it was easier for a hacker to detect the wireless code.

"A List of New California Laws effective July 1-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/california-tickets/"," This email is an alert to California or Texas drivers of several new laws to be aware of that the email says go into effect on July 1, 2007. "," Whoever put this email together was either intentionally ignoring the facts or summarizing some of the gossip about new California traffic laws. Note:  New laws regarding the use of cell phones do go into effect in California in July, 2008.  Details about that are listed at the bottom of this article. It didn’t take long for someone to start circulating it as applying to Texas and Georgia and more states will probably be added along the way. Most of it is not true. The Texas Department of Public Safety quickly issued a release saying that there were not any new laws scheduled to go into effect in July, 2007. That left the California question to be dealt with. We’ll go through each of the items one at a time, but first there are not statewide mandated penalties for traffic fines in California. There are guidelines from what is called the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule but local jurisdictions make their own decisions on fines for traffic citations.  You may have discovered that on your own if you’ve gotten a traffic ticket for the same violation in different California cities or counties.  You did not necessarily get the same fine. If you want to know what the typical fines are in your area, call your local traffic court. 1. Carpool lane – 1st time $1068.50 starting 7/1/07 (The $271 posted on the highway is old). Don’t do it again because 2nd time is going to be double. 3rd time triple, and 4th time license suspended- Fiction! In 2007, the recommended fine for a first time car pool violation was $380.  Repeat offenders can expect to pay more, but nothing near the amounts represented in this email. 2. Incorrect lane change – $380. Don’t cross the lane on solid lines or intersections- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $134 for a typical infraction. 3. Block intersection – $485- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $175. 4. Driving on the shoulder – $450- Fiction! The Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule said $134. 5. Cell phone use in the construction zone. – Double fine as of 07/01/07.  Cell phone use must be “hands free” while driving- Fiction! There was no law in California during 2007 restricting the use of cell phones in the car. There was such a law going into effect in July, 2008.   There was no “double fine” as of 7/1/07 because there was no law in effect regarding cell phones.  The new California law does not mention construction zones although penalties for traffic violations are higher if they occurred in a highway construction or maintenance area. 6. Passengers over 18 not in their seatbelts – both passengers and drivers get tickets- Truth! The California Mandatory Seat Belt Law requires all passengers to use some kind of restraint.   Children under 6 and weighing less than 60 pounds are required to be in “specified child passenger restraint system,” typically a car seat. Everybody older than 6 must wear seat belts.  At this writing the fines range from less than $100 for a first offence to more than $300 when it’s kids who are not buckled in.  According to the California Highway Patrol any adults in a vehicle who are not wearing seatbelts are subject to citation, not just the driver.  The driver will be held accountable for any children not restrained. 7. Speeders can only drive 3 miles above the limit- Fiction! The speed limit is the speed limit.  There is no legal definition allowing a driver to go 3 miles per hour above that. 8. DUI = JAIL (Stays on your driving record for 10 years!)- Truth! At the time of this writing a first offense for driving under the influence in California results in anywhere between 96 hours and 4 months in jail. a fine, and a six-month suspension of the license.  Those are the court penalties.  There are separate penalties to the Department of Motor Vehicles.  As of January 1, 2007 a driving under the influence conviction will be on a person’s record for 10 years. 9. As of 07/01/07 cell phone use must be “hands free” while driving.  Ticket is $285. They will be looking for this like crazy – easy money for police department- Fiction! By law all drivers in California must be using hands-free cell phones as of July 1, 2008.  The fine was $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense.  The exceptions are for emergency use, drivers of emergency vehicles, and drivers of commercial vehicles can use the push-to-talk type wireless phones until July 1, 2011. Here is a list of questions and answers from the California Highway  Patrol regarding the new cell phone laws for July 1, 2008: Wireless Telephone Laws FAQs Two new laws dealing with the use of wireless telephones while driving go into effect July 1, 2008. Below is a list of Frequently Asked Questions concerning these new laws. Q: When do the new wireless telephone laws take effect? A: The new laws take effect July 1, 2008 Q: What is the difference between the two laws? A: The first prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. (Vehicle Code (VC) §23123). Motorists 18 and over may use a hands-free device. Drivers under the age of 18 may NOT use a wireless telephone or hands-free device while operating a motor vehicle(VC §23124). Q: What if I need to use my telephone during an emergency, and I do not have a hands- free device? A: The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. Q: What are the fines if I’m convicted? A: The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. According to the Uniform Bail and Penalty Schedule, with the addition of penalty assessments, a first offense is $76 and a second offense is $190. Q: Will I receive a point on my drivers license if I’m convicted for a violation of the wireless telephone law? A: NO. The violation is a reportable offense: however, DMV will not assign a violation point. Q: Will the conviction appear on my driving record? A: Yes, but the violation point will not be added. Q: Will there be a grace period when motorists will only get a warning? A: NO. The law becomes in effect on July 1, 2008. Whether a citation is issued is always at the discretion of the officer based upon his or her determination of the most appropriate remedy for the situation. Q: Are passengers affected by this law? A: No. This law only applies to the person driving a motor vehicle. Q: Do these laws apply to out-of-state drivers whose home states do not have such laws? A: Yes Q: Can I be pulled over by a law enforcement officer for using my handheld wireless telephone? A: YES. A law enforcement officer can pull you over just for this infraction. Q: What if my phone has a push-to-talk feature, can I use that? A: No. The law does provide an exception for those operating a commercial motor truck or truck tractor (excluding pickups), implements of husbandry, farm vehicle or tow truck, to use a two-way radio operated by a “push-to-talk” feature. Q: What other exceptions are there? A: Operators of an authorized emergency vehicle during the course of employment are exempt as are those motorists operating a vehicle on private property DRIVERS 18 AND OVER Drivers 18 and over will be allowed to use a hands-free device to talk on their wireless telephone while driving. The following FAQs apply to those motorists 18 and over. Q: Does the new “hands-free” law prohibit you from dialing a wireless telephone while driving or just talking on it? A: The new law does not prohibit dialing, but drivers are strongly urged not to dial while driving. Q: Will it be legal to use a Blue Tooth or other earpiece? A: Yes, however you cannot have BOTH ears covered. Q: Does the new hands-free law allow you to use the speaker phone function of your wireless telephone while driving? A: Yes. Q: Does the new “hands-free” law allow drivers 18 and over to text page while driving? A: The law does not specifically prohibit that, but an officer can pull over and issue a citation to a driver of any age if, in the officer’s opinion, the driver was distracted and not operating the vehicle safely. Text paging while driving is unsafe at any speed and is strongly discouraged. DRIVERS UNDER 18 Q: Am I allowed to use my wireless telephone hands free? A: NO. Drivers under the age of 18 may not use a wireless telephone, pager, laptop or any other electronic communication or mobile services device to speak or text while driving in any manner, even hands free. EXCEPTION: Permitted in emergency situations to call police, fire or medical authorities. (VC §23124). Q: Why is the law stricter for provisional drivers? A: Statistics show that teen drivers are more likely than older drivers to be involved in crashes because they lack driving experience and tend to take greater risks. Teen drivers are vulnerable to driving distractions such as talking with passengers, eating or drinking, and talking or texting on wireless phones, which increase the chance of getting involved in serious vehicle crashes. Q: Can my parents give me permission to allow me to use my wireless telephone while driving? A: NO. The only exception is an emergency situation that requires you to call a law enforcement agency, a health care provider, the fire department or other emergency agency entity. Q: Does the law apply to me if I’m an emancipated minor? A: Yes. The restriction applies to all licensed drivers who are under the age of 18. Q: If I have my parent(s) or someone age 25 years or older in the car with me, may I use my wireless telephone while driving? A: NO. You may only use your wireless telephone in an emergency situation. Q: Will the restriction appear on my provisional license? A: No Q: May I use the hands-free feature while driving if my car has the feature built in? A: NO. The law prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from using any type of wireless device while driving, except in an emergency situation. Q: Can a law enforcement officer stop me for using my hands-free device while driving? A: No. For drivers under the age of 18, this is considered a SECONDARY violation meaning that a law enforcement officer may cite you for using a hands-free wireless phone if you were pulled over for another violation. However, the prohibition against using a handheld wireless telephone while driving is a PRIMARY violation for which a law enforcement officer can pull you over. Updated 3/15/08 ","Crime - Police"

"There are No-Go Zones in Europe under Sharia Law-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/no-go-zones-in-europe-under-sharia-law/"," There are “no-go zones” for non-Muslims in the United Kingdom, France and elsewhere in Europe where local police have no control and operate under Sharia Law. "," This eRumor is false. A pundit named Steven Emerson made the claim on Fox News on January 11, 2015. Following an attack on the offices of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo that killed 12 for publishing caricatures of Muhammed, Emerson said: (The no-go zones) are sort of amorphous, they’re not contiguous, but they’re sort of safe havens. They’re places where the governments like France, Britain, Sweden and Germany don’t exercise any sovereignty. So you basically have zones where Sharia courts are set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where police don’t go in, and it’s basically a separate country, a country within a country. In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones; there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim, where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in. In parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and wound seriously anyone who doesn’t dress according to Muslim religious attire. British Prime Minister David Cameron quickly disputed Emerson’s claims and said Emerson is “clearly an idiot” in an interview with ITV News: When I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools’ Day. This guy’s clearly a complete idiot. He started with an apology, that’s not a bad start, but what he should do is actually look at Birmingham and see what a fantastic example it is of brining people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and actually building a world class, brilliant city with a great and strong economy. In reality, plenty of Christians and Muslims live in Birmingham. According to the Britain’s 2011 census , 413,474 adults there identified themselves as Christians and 148,145 identified as Muslims. Sharia courts don’t exist in France, either. The map of no-go zones referenced by Emerson actually appears under the heading, “Atlas of Sensitive Urban Zones” on a government website. They are considered high-crime areas and have been targeted by the government for urban renewal efforts. Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the U.S., took to Twitter to explain: There are dangerous neighborhoods in France, like in the U.S., because of crime, not Islam. There is no ‘Sharia court’ in France. It is so ridiculous that I am ashamed to be obliged to react. For his part, Emerson issued an apology on his website and explained that he had used unreliable sources in making his comments about Birmingham: I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. There was no excuse for making this mistake and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham. I am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake. I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham. Steve Emerson PS. I am making donation to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. There aren’t any known areas of Western Europe that operate under Sharia Law.  Professor Jan Michiel Otto of the Leiden University Law School in the Netherlands explains, via the Huffington Post , that Sharia law typically falls into three categories: classical Sharia systems, secular systems and mixed systems: In countries with classical Shariah systems, Shariah has official status or a high degree of influence on the legal system, and covers family law, criminal law, and in some places, personal beliefs, including penalties for apostasy, blasphemy, and not praying. These countries include Egypt, Mauritania, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Maldives, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and certain regions in Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates. Mixed systems are the most common in Muslim-majority countries. Generally speaking, Shariah covers family law, while secular courts will cover everything else. Countries include: Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, and Syria. Otto adds that Islamic family law courts are available to Muslim minorities in some countries, including the United Kingdom. ","Crime - Police"
"Humane Society Spends Less than 1% of Donations on Local Animal Shelters-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:06","https://www.truthorfiction.com/humane-society-spends-less-than-1-percent-of-donations-on-local-animal-shelters/"," Less than 1% of donations to the Humane Society go to local animal shelters and direct care for animals. "," It’s not true that the Humane Society of the United States gives less than 1% of its donations to local animal shelters to provide care for animals. In 2013, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) took in about $115.5 million in contributions and grants. The Humane Society also generated about $17.1 million in additional revenue from investments and other sources, brining its total revenue in 2013 to more than $132 million. In that year, the Humane Society dedicated $21.7 million to cruelty prevention programs and direct animal care, which was about 16.5% of its total revenues, according to tax forms . Besides, the Humane Society said the claim is a ”misdirection.” There are about 3,500 animal shelters in the United States, the Humane Society says , and private organizations or local governments run about half of them: “They have their own policies, governance and operational priorities. The HSUS does not run them nor serve as a parent association, and never has. No group could serve this purpose. “We do work to professionalize the field of animal care with our education and training programs for local organizations, and provide millions of dollars in grants every year. But our primary purpose is not grant-making. The work of The HSUS is broad and focused on all animals. We don’t need to give money to others to do it. “The HSUS and its affiliates are the number one provider of animal care in the United States; the number one advocacy organization preventing cruelty and abuse; and the number one provider of training and standards to lift up the entire field of animal welfare. We spend more than 80 percent of our funds on program expenses to help pets, wildlife, animals in laboratories, farm animals, marine mammals and other animals at risk in society.” Claims that the Humane Society provides little support for direct animal care first went viral when a group called HumaneWatch aired an attack ad during the Academy Awards in 2012. The ad appeared to be in response to the Humane Society’s animal welfare advocacy efforts. HumaneWatch is funded by the Center for Consumer Freedom, an organization founded by Richard Berman, a lawyer, pubic relations executive and lobbyist. According to the non-profit group’s website : “Founded in 1996, the Center for Consumer Freedom is a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting personal responsibility and protecting consumer choices. We believe that the consumer is King. And Queen. “A growing cabal of activists has meddled in Americans’ lives in recent years. They include self-anointed ‘food police,’ health campaigners, trial lawyers, personal-finance do-gooders, animal-rights misanthropes, and meddling bureaucrats.” To back up its claims about the Humane Society of the United States, a spokesperson for HumaneWatch previously cited a survey of 400 animal shelter representatives that was conducted over a two-day period. However, the Humane Society’s tax records from 2013 indicate that the claim is false. ","Crime - Police"
"George Soros Paid Millions to Help Protestors in Ferguson-Truth!","2015-03-17 20:38:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/george-soros-paid-millions-to-help-protestors-in-ferguson/"," Billionaire George Soros paid millions of dollars to support groups protested a grand jury’s decision not to prosecute former police officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. "," This claim is mostly true, but some variations of it are misleading. George Soros is the founder and chairman of the Open Society Foundation (OSF), a nonprofit with a mission to “work to build vibrant and tolerant societies whose governments are accountable and open to participation by all people.” OSF has dedicated more than $11 billion to the cause globally since it was founded. Reports that OSF donated millions to community groups that led protest efforts in Ferguson started with a report by the Washington Times. The Times reports : Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times. In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grassroots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations. The financial tether from Mr. Soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a one-day criminal event in Missouri into a 24-hour-a-day national cause celebre. The Times lists a number of organizations that received funding from OSF and later participated in the Ferguson protests at some level: the Gamaliel Foundation, Millennial Activists United, the Advancement Project, PICO, the Organization for Black Struggle, Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment and the Drug Policy Alliance. The article doesn’t say which tax year that OSF invested $33 million in those groups. But in 2013, OSF invested more than $111 million in its U.S. programs, which funnel support into various groups and organizations: U.S. Programs Campaign for Black Male Achievement $ 5,947,000 Campaign for a New Drug Policy 8,522,000 Criminal Justice Fund 16,749,000 Democracy Fund 11,843,000 Equality Fund 10,624,000 National Security and Human Rights Campaign 4,504,000 Open Places Initiatives 1,634,000 Open Society Institute-Baltimore 7,472,000 Special Initiatives and Partnerships 12,325,000 Strategic Opportunities Fund 152,000 U.S. Programs General Administration 7,955,000 U.S. Programs General Funds 18,535,000 Young Men’s Initiative 5,323,000 TOTAL US PROGRAMS $ 111,585,000 However, some variations of the eRumor claim that OSF spent $33 million on Ferguson protests alone, which isn’t true. Community groups support a number of initiatives, so it’s not possible for them to dedicate their entire budget to a single cause. But In addition to its annual investments in those community groups, OSF also donated millions directly to protestors in Ferguson. According to a December 17, 2014, OSF blog post : This month we invested $2.5 million to support frontline community groups in Ferguson, as well as develop a national database on the police use of force—both to better identify problematic practices and examples of effective, responsive, and accountable policing. Then, two days later, OSF announced that it would make $2.9 million in additional investments. OSF said the funds would support the social movements in Ferguson and Staten Island, where protests erupted after a police officer that killed Eric Garner was not prosecuted. According to a December 19, 2014, OSF blog post : The Open Society Foundations are committed to advancing racial justice—through our ongoing work to end mass incarceration, our programmatic focus on black men and boys, our attempts to close the racial wealth gap, and our efforts to mitigate harsh school discipline policies that disproportionately affect children of color. To supplement those efforts, we are this week making additional investments totaling $2.9 million in response to the recent events in Ferguson and Staten Island. One portion of the investment is intended to help community groups in Missouri advance initiatives to promote police accountability. A second component will further the development of a nationwide database involving police stops and use of force, thereby addressing one of the systemic flaws that limits the ability of police departments and communities to address bias-related issues. To advance the work on the ground in Ferguson and the greater St. Louis County, Open Society is making grants to help the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. They will partner with the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD) and Communities United for Police Reform(CUPR) to obtain greater civilian oversight of local police departments in St. Louis County, enhance accountability, address excessive municipal court fines, improve police recruiting and training, and develop neighborhood assemblies to encourage greater civic participation. CPD and CUPR will also examine the ways in which national organizations can support local groups who are leading community-based mobilization efforts to reform police practices. Even so, claims that the groups donated directly to or paid protestors in Ferguson are shaky at best. The OSF release said the funds were earmarked to support “initiatives to promote police accountability” and to develop a “nationwide database involving police stops and use of force.” So, while groups participating in protests received funding from a Soros-backed group, those funds were intended to support their causes, not the actual protests. That’s why we’re calling this one “truth and misleading.” ","Crime - Police"
"Duke to Host Muslim Call To Prayer – Truth! & Resolved!","2015-03-17 20:38:04","https://www.truthorfiction.com/duke-to-host-muslim-call-to-prayer/"," Duke University administrators announced plans to host a regular Muslim prayer at its chapel bell tower on Friday afternoons. "," It’s true Duke University announced a weekly call to prayer for Muslims at a chapel on campus, but the decision was amended days later due to controversy. The announcement was appeared on the website of Duke Today, a university publication, on January 13, 2015: DURHAM, NC – Members of the Duke Muslim Students Association will  chant a weekly call-to-prayer from the Duke Chapel bell tower  beginning Friday, Jan. 16. The chant, called the “adhan,” announces the start of the group’s  jummah prayer service, which takes place in the chapel basement each  Friday at 1 p.m. The service is open to the public. The chant lasts about three minutes and will be moderately  amplified. “The adhan is the call to prayer that brings Muslims back to their  purpose in life, which is to worship God and serves as a reminder to  serve our brothers and sisters in humanity,” said Imam Adeel Zeb,  Muslim chaplain at Duke. “The collective Muslim community is truly  grateful and excited about Duke’s intentionality toward religious  and cultural diversity.” Franklin Graham, son of the late televangelist Billy Graham, was vocal in his criticism of the Muslim call to prayer on his Facebook page : Duke University announced today that they will have a Muslim call to  prayer from their chapel bell tower every Friday. As Christianity is  being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are  raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who  doesn’t submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this  in the name of religious pluralism. I call on the donors and alumni  to withhold their support from Duke until this policy is reversed. Others joined Graham in rallying against the call to prayer, and the university’s Facebook page was inundated with vocal opposition from other Christians. Graham then posted a second message about the prayer: The Muslim call to prayer that has been approved to go out across  the campus of Duke University every Friday afternoon for three  minutes includes “Allahu Akbar”—the words that  the terrorists shouted at the onset of last week’s massacre in  Paris. It includes the proclamation that there is no god but Allah  and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Will evangelical  Christians be allowed the same three minutes weekly to broadcast the  message across campus that God Almighty of the Bible sent His Son  Jesus Christ to offer forgiveness of sins and salvation to all who  will repent, believe, and call on His Name? Jesus said, “I am the  way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except  through Me” (John 14:6). In the face of strong opposition, Duke officials released a second statement on January 15, 2015, that explained that the university had decided to hold the Muslim call-to-prayer chant outside the chapel bell tower: Duke University has reconsidered a previously announced plan to  present a traditional Muslim call-to-prayer from the Duke Chapel  bell tower, campus officials said Thursday. The call to prayer, or “adhan,” which announces the start of a  weekly jummah prayer service that has been held in the Chapel  basement for the past several years, will not come from the bell  tower on Friday as announced earlier. “Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and  welcoming campus for all of its students,” said Michael Schoenfeld,  vice president for public affairs and government relations.  “However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify  was not having the intended effect.” Jummah prayers have taken place in the basement of Duke Chapel for  many years, and start with the traditional call to prayer chant.  Members of the Muslim community will now gather for the  call-to-prayer chant on the quadrangle outside the Chapel, a site of  frequent interfaith programs and activities, before moving to  its regular location for prayers. More than 700 of Duke’s 15,000  undergraduate and graduate students identify as Muslim. “Our Muslim community enriches the university in countless ways,”  said Schoenfeld. “We welcome the active expression of their faith  tradition, and all others, in ways that are meaningful and visible.” Duke has Christian ties that date back to its founding in 1924. The university was founded around the Methodist-affiliated Trinity College and was known as Trinity-Duke in its early years. The book, “ The Launching of Duke University ,” provides a detailed account: Initially, Duke followed the long-established, Methodist-sanctioned  policy that Trinity had scrupulously observed: no dancing on campus.  Off the campus and with approved arrangements concerning loation,  hours and chaperones, university officials shut their eyes about  what many churchgoers still regarded as a serious social vice. Today, Duke’s bylaws state that its aim is to “assert faith in the eternal union of knowledge and religion set forth in the teachings and character of Jesus Christ.” But Michael Schoenfeld, vice president of public affairs and government relations at Duke, said Duke is an independent and non-sectarian institution with ties to the church that are primarily historical and symbolic. Schoenfeld made the comment after a court decision threatened the ability of campus police to patrol religious institutions in 2010. ","Crime - Police"
"Claims about Michael Brown’s Family – Truth! & Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-about-michael-browns-family/"," Claims about Michael Brown Jr.’s family circulated the web following a grand jury’s decision not to indict former officer Darren Wilson in the teenager’s fatal shooting. "," Claims made about the Brown family in countless forwarded emails and social media posts are both true and false. The eRumor cites a number claims about Michael Brown Jr.’s parents, upbringing and family life to back up a larger social commentary: “If anything is to be mourned, it is the fact that Michael never had a chance to live with two real parents who loved and raised him in their home. He only became important to them when he was dead. “Why don’t Sharpton, Jackson, Holder and Obama focus on the need to rebuild real, solid family units and values in the black community where parents are dedicated to their kids and they focus on their lives before and not after they are gone. Michael Brown did not have that opportunity.” While the eRumor’s larger social commentary is a matter of personal opinion that cannot be proven true or false, the individual facts used to make that argument can be fact-checked and vetted. It’s true that Michael Brown Jr’s parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., never wed. But the claim that Brown Jr. never lived with “two real parents who loved and raised him” is false. The New York Times reports that Brown Jr. lived under one roof with McSpadden, Brown Sr. and his paternal grandparents as a boy before his parents separated. Brown Jr. then moved in with his mother before he moved in with his paternal grandparents after his mother moved out of the district where he attended high school. Pearlie Gordon, however, wasn’t Brown Jr.’s paternal grandmother, as the eRumor claims. Gordon was the mother of Brown Sr.’s wife, which made her his mother-in-law, according to Ferguson police records . And contrary to the eRumor’s claims, McSpadden and Louis Head were married a month before Brown’s shooting, USA Today reports . The eRumor also misidentifies Head in a photo. The man pictured beside McSpadden is actually Michael Brown Sr., Michael Brown Jr.’s biological father. And It’s true, as the eRumor claims, that McSpadden was under investigation for her role in an alleged altercation with Gordon and other street vendors who were selling “Justice for Michael Brown” t-shirts in Ferguson. The case was referred to detectives for further investigation. A police report on the incident didn’t indicate what charges, if any, would result from the investigation. The report said Pearle Gordon was among a group of street vendors selling t-shirts and afghans on Florissant Street when the incident unfolded on October 18, 2014. Gordon reported that McSpadden was among a group of 20-30 people who “rushed” the street vendors to confront them about selling the merchandise. According to police report: “Gordon told McSpadden she was Michael Brown Sr.’s mother-in-law, and unless McSpadden could produce documentation stating she had a patent on her son’s name, Gordon was going to continue to sell her merchandise. Desureia Harris (McSpadden’s mother) told Gordon ‘you don’t know my grandson like that’ … and Harris then proceeded to rip down t-shirts and other items hanging on a line.” Gordon told police the vendors were attacked and lost more than $1,500 in merchandise and $400 in cash in the encounter. Police investigation into the incident is ongoing. Future updates will be posted here. ","Crime - Police"
"Claims about New York Mayor Bill de Blasio – Mostly True!","2015-03-17 20:38:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-about-new-york-gov-bill-de-blasio/"," A viral email claims that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio helped Marxist soldiers in Central America in the 1980s and returned to America with radical leftist ideals. "," This eRumor accurately summarizes many of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio’s early experiences in politics. But the mayor now describes himself as a progressive, not a communist, as the eRumor alleges. The email was taken from an article by Jennifer Kerns that was published by The Blaze, a conservative website, on December 24, 2014. Much of de Blasio’s early history cited in the eRumor was taken from a New York Times article published in September of 2013. de Blasio’s experiences in Central America in the late 1980s were, “More influential in shaping his ideology than previously known,” and the work he did was more political than humanitarian, the Times reports: Mr. de Blasio, who studied Latin American politics at Columbia and  was conversational in Spanish, grew to be an admirer of Nicaragua’s  ruling Sandinista party, thrusting himself into one of the most  polarizing issues in American politics at the time. The Reagan  administration denounced the Sandinistas as tyrannical and  Communist, while their liberal backers argued that after years of  dictatorship, they were building a free society with broad access to  education, land and health care. The Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF) was a leftist group that ended nearly 50 years of dictatorship in Nicaragua with a coup in 1979. The U.S. opposed the SNLF and armed and financed the Contras , counter-revolutionary forces based in Honduras, to fight them, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The Times reports that de Blasio became an “ardent supporter of the Nicaraguan revolutionaries.” Then, when de Blasio returned to the U.S, he helped raise money for the Sandinistas. In 1990, he described his goals for society as a “democratic socialism.” But de Blasio was later critical of the Sandinistas’ tactics and described more moderate political views: Now, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, describes himself as a  progressive. He has campaigned for mayor as a liberal firebrand who  would set out to reduce inequality in the city by offering more help  to poor families and asking wealthy residents to pay more in taxes.  He said that seeing the efforts of the Sandinistas up close  strengthened his view that government should protect and enhance the  lives of the poor. “It was very affecting for me,” Mr. de Blasio said of his work  with Nicaraguans, in a recent interview. “They were in their own  humble way, in this small country, trying to figure out what would  work better.” The sudden upswing in criticism of de Blasio’s political past can be linked to his response to Eric Garner’s choking death at the hands of a New York police officer. The mayor, whose wife is black, said in a press conference that he has warned his son about interactions with police officers for years: “Chirlane and I have had to talk to Dante for years about the  dangers that he may face – good young man, law abiding young man,  never would think to do anything wrong, and yet because of the  history that still hangs over us, the dangers he may face. We’ve had  to literally train him, as families have all over this city for  decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with  the police officers who are there to protect him,” de Blasio said. The mayor’s comments drew criticism from police unions, former New York Governor Rudy Giuliani and conservative groups like The Blaze. ","Crime - Police"

Wasp spray shoots a stream up to twenty feet and can temporality blind an attacker. "," The source quoted in the   eRumor for this suggestion of the use of wasp spray for defense is a man   named Val Glinka. He is real and is a self defense instructor at   Sylvania Southview High School near Toledo Ohio. He told an ABC affiliate that he considers wasp   spray “inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or pepper   spray.”  Glinka said, “This is better than anything I can teach   them.” Pepper spray is a personal defense weapon that is legal in all 50   states. Each state has various restrictions as to how it is sold and   when it was originally introduced users in some states had to take a   self defense class to be certified for proper use. We have not found any other credible source that recommends using wasp   spray instead of pepper spray. We have not found any studies that   suggest that wasp spray would be effective as a deterrent. There is also a   liability issue to consider. There is the question of whether using   insecticides in such a manner could bring liability issues for the user.      Insecticides are controlled by the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), which prohibits   the use of such products other than the originally intended purpose.     The EPA web site has information posted that says insecticides must be   properly labeled to inform users on proper use before they can be sold.

"Deadly Aftermath of Harold Camping’s May 21, 2011 Judgement Day Prediction-Truth! & Unconfirmed!","2015-03-17 18:06:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/vietnam-aftermath/"," There are reports of suicides and even murders resulting from the Doomsday prediction of Family Radio’s Bible Teacher Harold Camping that judgment day would come on May 21, 2011 and that the true believers in Jesus Christ would be raptured to heaven. "," Harold Camping is a self-taught Bible teacher who was one of the founders of Family Radio, a collection of radio stations and affiliates based in Oakland, California. Camping hosted a live Monday through Friday talk show on the network during which he spread his teachings and took phone calls answering Bible questions. Camping first attracted attention outside of his followers when he wrote a book titled 1994? in which he predicted that the end of the world would probably take place between September 15 and 17 of that year. When it didn’t he said that he’d gotten his calculations wrong. Camping bases his views on his own brand of Biblical numerology. He’s an engineer by training and likes playing with numbers. His calculations are a little hard to follow and some are based on assumptions of the dates of events like the creation or the world or Noah’s flood. He became a fresh subject of news headlines in 2011 when he began to intensely promote his conviction that on May 21, 2011, there would be catastrophic earthquakes and other natural phenomena harkening the beginning of severe judgment on the world. He also predicted that those who were “true believers” in Jesus Christ would be taken from the earth and go to heaven on that date. Associated with that he said that after a period of judgement the world would come to an end on October 2 1, 2011. Camping was alone in his assertions. No other church, denomination, or major pastor or Bible teacher supported his theory and most condemned it. During the months leading up to May 21, Camping spread the word about judgement day through his radio broadcast, which is heard both in the United States and several foreign countries, and there were reports that Family Radio spent millions of dollars buying advertising time and funding a caravan of motor homes that went from city to city to warn people about the pending event. The predicted date came and went without anything happening. Harold Camping went into seclusion for a few days then emerged to say that he would explain everything in a special radio broadcast on his network. In that program, Camping announced that he was at first bewildered when nothing seemed to happen but that he then realized that judgment day did indeed come on May 21, but it was spiritual not physical and that was why nobody noticed it. In June, 2011, Camping was hospitalized because of a stroke and later transferred to a nursing home. Family Radio announced an end to his program and substituted it with another. Over the following weeks, however, information started emerging about some of the fallout of his prediction. Nobody knows how many people took him seriously, but some stories came to light that caused great concern about the impact of his failed prediction. A few days after the May 21, a Florida man who was visiting family in California jumped into a reservoir in Contra Loma regional Park in Antioch saying he had to “get to God.” Family members said the 25-year old man became erratic and “started talking about God more profoundly…” After watching a video about UFO’s he started quoting Bible verses from the book of Ezekiel and insisted that he had to go to the park. One of the detectives in the case said the man “…told his family that he now understood the Bible and that God was going to come see him.” He dived into the reservoir. His brother and his wife jumped in to save him and brought him ashore, but he jumped back into the lack and drowned. Investigators said that the coverage of Camping’s prediction was to blame. In Palmdale, California, authorities say that a woman who wanted to protect her children from the “tribulation” slit the throats of her two daughters before cutting her own throat. This happened in March of 2011. The injuries were not fatal, however, and all survived. The daughters were 11 and 14. In Michigan, a group of teenagers who say they were celebrating the failed prediction of the May 21 rapture decided to mark the occasion by jumping from a bridge. A 17-year old who did not know how to swim was swept away by the current and drowned. News reports from Taiwan told of an elderly man who jumped out of a building on May 5 saying he had heard that doomsday was nearing. News reports in June told of a Malawian man who pleaded guilty to “circulating false documents” about the judgment day prediction. He was identified as a 39-year old bicycle repairman who had been spreading the world about May 21. Police charged him with “circulating false documents that threatened the peace and security of citizens.” He was given a six-month suspended sentence. There were also news reports from Vietnam that an ethnic group in the northern reaches of the country, the tribal Hmong people, were among those who took the prophecy to heart. They had heard it through missionary radio. The news reports said there were “thousands” of people gathering on a hillside to await their trip to heaven. In July, 2011, James Jacob Prasch of Moriel Ministries traveled to Vietnam and met with Hmong leaders. He reported that more than 7,000 Hmongs did gather on a mountain with hopes that they were going to be delivered from their suffering at the hands of the Communist government. Prosch was told that at one point police and military police opened gunfire on the crowd and that many were killed and buried in mass graves on the site. He also said that two pastors were beheaded and that many thousands are missing and either among the dead, among the imprisoned, or scattered in the local jungle. updated 07/16/11 ","Crime - Police"

"," This eRumor has circulated since 2005 and is not true.  The Wheaton police say they have never heard of it happening in their city and TruthOrFiction.com has not found any documented evidence that it’s happened anywhere.

"Speeding ticket frenzy by law enforcement?-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/ticket-frenzy/"," The eRumor warns motorists that that state or local law enforcement is going to be cracking down heavily on speeders during a 30-day period.  It claims there will be a “speeding ticket frenzy” to add dollars to state coffers. "," There have been several     versions of this eRumor. Pennsylvania State Police were said to be conducting a “speeding ticket     frenzy” to pay the costs of hiring new troopers and to pay trooper     benefits.  Not true according to State Police Commissioner Jeffrey     B.

Part-time officers were said to be     called in on full-time duty.  TruthOrFiction.com has found     no substantiation for this story and the California Highway Patrol has     officially termed it a hoax. The CHP said that there are no plans to target     motorists in Orange County for speeding and that several facts in the     eRumor are wrong.  First, the CHP says that funds generated from     speeding tickets do not benefit either the CHP or the state of     California and that all fines are levied by the local courts.      Also, the CHP does not have “part time” officers.  All     sworn officers are full-time.  Additionally, the CHP says it     prohibits quotas in writing tickets. It should be added that nothing of this nature could have been done by     the legislature without passing legislation for it, which would have     brought howls of protest.

"Warnings about propane tanks used for making meth-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/propane-tanks/"," An alert from a police officer in Oklahoma about a danger involving recycled propane tanks.  She says that people are stealing propane tanks from retailers and using them to transport anhydrous ammonia, a substance used in making illegal meth.  They may then exchange them back to the retailers, which consumers need to be aware of because the anhydrous ammonia is corrosive and may render the tank dangerous for future use.  She recommends that if you get a tank at a refill station that has blue or green residue around the valve, don’t use it. "," It’s not clear how widespread this threat is, but the same warning is being issued by numerous law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Canada. The problem is that the anhydrous ammonia used in making methamphetamine can corrode the valve at the top of the tank, making it dangerous to use.  If any of the anhydrous ammonia happens to be in the tank, that can be dangerous as well to skin and lungs.  Thieves not only use the small propane tanks for storing the ammonia, but for stealing it from larger tanks at businesses or farms. Most of the other warnings we’ve seen from law enforcement also say to look for blue, green, or blue-green residue around the valve as possible evidence that the tank may have been used with the ammonia. The National Propane Gas Association has issued an alert about the problem.  In a statement, the association said, “The brass valve in a propane cylinder will be damaged if it comes in contact with anhydrous ammonia. This deterioration will lead to cracking of the valve body or its components and can ultimately result in a violent, unexpected expulsion of the valve from the cylinder, causing personal injury or death.” So far, we’ve not found a case in which a consumer has experienced problems because of a recycled propane tank damaged by use in making meth.  It doesn’t seem likely that meth makers would return used tanks to refill stations unless they happened to want some propane.  The signs of contamination on the tanks would be a tip-off to the refill stations that a criminal may be present. Ohio State University issued a warning to farmers who use anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen-based fertilizer.  The farmers usually have large tanks of the ammonia and meth makers steal small quantities by using the barbecue type propane tanks.  Among other warnings, the university urged farmers to be wary about any consumer tanks found on their property that have the signs of contamination and, therefore, the threat of injury. It is recommended that if you spot the signs of contamination when purchasing a cylinder, refuse it.  If you discover that you have a tank with signs of contamination, don’t move it.  Call your local fire department for proper handling and disposal.  Or you can contact the National Propane Gas Association at 1-800-728-2482.

The impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives and ends in the Senate with a trial. All 100 senators serve as the jury, with the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court presiding, according to the U.S. Constitution . The eRumor’s claim that Roberts has “signed off” on INTERPOL removing Obama from office presupposes that the president already stood trial before the Senate and was convicted of treason — all without a single report from the countless news organizations that cover Capitol Hill 24/7. The eRumor also misinterprets what INTERPOL does. It’s a communications network that helps police agencies around the world share intelligence on fugitives who commit a crime in one country and then flee to another, according to its website . INTERPOL doesn’t employ agents or police officers of its own. Nor does it have the authority or means to arrest an American on U.S. soil — let alone to remove a sitting president from office, according to the Department of Justice . Also, the White House responded to a petition signed by nearly 50,000 citizens that called for the president’s impeachment.

"," Theodore Roosevelt at the age of 42 was sworn into office as the 26th President of the United States after the assassination of William McKinley .   To this day, Roosevelt is the youngest man to ever hold the office of President, and it wasn’t until nearly six decades later that John F. Kennedy became the youngest man to win a Presidential election. According to the Theodore Roosevelt Association, prior to being a US Vice President Roosevelt was a New York State Assemblyman, Governor of New York, deputy sheriff in the Dakota Territory, Police Commissioner of New York City, U.S. Civil Service Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Colonel of the Rough Riders.  He was married to Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt and had 6 children, Theodore Jr. (actually III),  Kermit, Ethel, Alice, Archie and Quentin. Roosevelt lived in the Whitehouse from 1901 to 1909 serving two terms as a Republican President.  He had many accomplishments while in office but is best know for his stewardship of the land and as a conservationist he provided federal protection for close to 230 million acres.  He became the first US President to win a Nobel Prize, introduced his “big stick” policy to build up the Navy making the United States a super power and reduced the National debt by over $90,000,000. In 1912 he decided to run for a third run for office against President William Howard Taft (GOP) and Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson.  Roosevelt ran under the progressive “Bull Moose Party” with one of his platform planks being the woman’s right to vote.  There was an assassination attempt on his life and Roosevelt was shot while on the campaign trail.  Two weeks later he gave a speech at Madison Square Gardens and held up this bloody shirt with two bullet holes in his shirt to the audience stating, “It takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!”   Wilson defeated Roosevelt by 347 electoral votes. After his defeat, Roosevelt sank into a brief depression, according “The River of Doubt”, a biography written by Cadice Miller.  He eventually pulled himself together and organized an expedition into the territory surrounding an uncharted river called Rio da Duvida or River of Doubt in South America.  This was done at the request of the Brazilian government and The American Museum of Natural History and the expedition forever changed the map of the Western Hemisphere.  The 1,000-mile-long Amazon tributary Rio da Duvida was later renamed to Rio Teodoro in Roosevelt’s honor.  This expedition on foot over land and on the water in dugout canoes saw lots of adventure but proved to be Roosevelt’s greatest physical challenge which he almost did not survive.

"Sandy Hook Shooting Was Staged by the Government-Unproven!","2015-03-17 18:06:30","https://www.truthorfiction.com/sandy-hook-shooting-conspiracy-theory/"," Blog posts and articles circling the Web allege that the federal government staged the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School to shore up support for new gun control laws. "," Many of the theories surrounding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting are based on personal opinions that cannot be definitively proven true or false — so this eRumor remains unproven. An official review of state and local law enforcement agencies’ response to the shooting, however, contradicts the claim that there were irregularities in the police response to the situation. A Connecticut Police Chiefs Association report found that officers made entry to the building less than nine minutes after the first emergency call was received at 9:35 a.m. The shooter committed suicide within two minutes of officers arriving. The report continued: State and local police continued to search the building and quickly triaged any victims they discovered. A Newtown Officer found a critically injured child, since EMS had not been cleared to approach the building; the officer scooped up the child and sprinted toward the EMS staging area. This is recorded by in-car video at 09:56:16 hours. Soon after, officers and troopers found other children and adults in the immediate vicinity of the suspect and led them out of the building. In-car video shows the wounded and trapped being shuttled out of the building from 09:58:39 hours on. This continued until the building was emptied. That report states that New Town, Conn., police officers correctly prioritized neutralizing the shooter before providing clearance for emergency response efforts to proceed. No information is available regarding what time the first media broadcast went live from the scene, so it’s impossible to determine what phase of the response television viewers first witnessed. Media outlets traditionally do not broadcast live footage from active crime scenes that involve shooters because it could allow the perpetrator to gain a tactical advantage over officers who are responding, or expose viewers to gruesome images of victims. The claim that New Hampshire Gov. Dan Malloy said he had been spoken to about how “something like this may happen” on Dec. 12, 2012, is true, according to a video of the press conference. “Earlier today, a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community,” Malloy said. “The lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to in attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident.” The claim that Robbie Parker, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School victim Emily Parker, is an actor appears to be based on speculation, not credible evidence.

"Obama Truth Squad-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:28","https://www.truthorfiction.com/obama-truth-squad/"," An eRumor stating that Senator Barak Obama, in an effort to stop the negative ads against him, has recruited people in law enforcement in Missouri to “to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.” "," KMOV-TV reported this story and posted on its web site September 29, 2008.  It said that a group of Obama supporters consisting of two prosecution attorneys and a county sheriff had assembled in St. Louis to intercept Obama rumors and debunk them.  There had been numerous rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign season such as that Senator Obama was a Muslim and had associations with known terrorists such as Bill Ayers.  KMOV-TV said that the group was prepared to stop attacks on their presidential candidate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also reported on September 30, 2008 the formation of the Obama Truth Squad and this was a topic of conversation on the Rush Limbaugh radio show as wells as programs on the Fox News Channel. According to the Post-Dispatch, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer have joined forces to form the “Obama truth squad.” Joyce and McCulloch stated, “The truth squad’s plan is to identify false attacks and respond immediately with truthful information.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch article also stated that these people were all Democrats. It is not uncommon for a campaign to use spokespersons to debunk false claims against the candidate. Senator McCain has used the services of supporters, mostly military and former prisoners of war, although South Carolina House Speaker Bobby Harrell and Henry McMaster, the Attorney General for that state, are listed in his own truth squad to assist in setting the record straight. Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, issued a statement that accused Obama of “police state tactics” which would “intimidate people and kill free debate.” In a telephone interview with Fox News he voiced his concerns about prosecutors and sheriffs responding to false claims against Obama and taking aggressive action. In his statement, Governor Blunt told Obama, “Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts – not a free society.” When asked about intimidating effect on voters, a deputy communications director for the Obama campaign told Fox news that Blunt was mischaracterizing this. According to a news article posted by the Star Tribune of Minneapolis – St. Paul, Minnesota on August 22, 2008, Bill Ayers was part of a group that claimed responsibility for bombings at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol in the 1960’s.   Ayers surrendered to authorities in 1980 and owing to misconduct claims against the prosecution his charges were dropped.   Obama stated that he “deplored” Ayers’ actions in the 1960s and that “by the time I met him, he is a professor of education at the University of Illinois.” Critics of the Obama-Ayers relationship said that Obama has had close association with, and the support of, a militant who has never really repented of Pentagon and U.S. Capitol bombings and has actually been quoted in the New York Times on September 11, 2001 as saying that ”I don’t regret setting bombs,” and  ”I feel we didn’t do enough.” Ayers went on to become one of Obama’s most important supporters and the first fund-raiser for Obama’s campaign for the Illinois senate was set up by Ayers. Obama objects to the criticism saying that his association with Ayers was long after his young militant days.  Ayers and Obama served together for the non profit education reform organization, Chicago Annenberg Challenge.

"," There is no new policy by the Obama Administration forbidding U.S. Servicemen from appearing at faith-based fund raising events. We have found Department of Defense (DOD) ethics polices dating back as far as 1997 that prohibited DOD employees from officially endorsing or appearing to endorse membership drives or fundraising activities for non-federal entities.

Stube’s permission to speak was revoked by his commanding officer although this was not because of any new policy of the Obama administration, as the email implied. Sergeant Stube is with U.S. Army Special Forces and was seriously injured in 2006 while serving in Afghanistan.  An improvised explosive device (IED) set off by the Taliban detonated and sent a one-pound piece of shrapnel through his hip and his intestines.   He also lost part of his leg from the fire blast of the explosion but miraculously survived the ordeal.

"The National Anthem isn’t a Pop Song-Opinion!","2015-03-17 18:06:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/national-anthem-not-a-pop-song/"," This is a forwarded email that advises singers of the National Anthem at sporting events to stop styling it up and sing the song like it was written and taught in schools.  The writer is alleged to be a former U.S. Marine Colonel. "," This eRumor appears to be taken from an opinion written on February 8, 2011 by Mark Corallo, a veteran of the U.S. Army and who said that the National Anthem is sacred to him and his family of veterans.   The opinion was found posted on the Daily Caller. Here is the complete opinion piece: The National Anthem isn’t a Pop Song By Mark Corallo I’ve heard quite a bit of criticism of Christina Aguilera’s embarrassing rendition of our national anthem prior to kick-off Sunday night. Most of the comments have been focused on her botching the lyrics. Fair enough. But why should we be so critical of a pop star who probably has no idea of the origins of “The Star Spangled Banner” or any sense that the song’s designation as our national anthem makes it about all of us, not about her moment on the stage? She is no different than the dozens of pop stars who over the years have treated the national anthem like a tone poem open to their artistic interpretation, no matter how bad or inappropriate that interpretation may be. Granted, Christina’s was worse than several we’ve been forced to endure prior to past Super Bowls, World Series, NBA All Star Games and other sporting events, but not by much. By today’s standards, hers was pretty much par for the course. She just happened to bogey the lyrics as well as murder the tune. Like most human beings, I love music. I have a tremendous amount of respect for musicians and performers of all kinds. Theirs is not an easy profession, no matter how much money, fame and success they attain. I couldn’t get through the day without them. But as an Army veteran in a family of veterans, the national anthem is sacred to me. Not because it’s a beautiful melody, or because it’s a great piece of poetry. It is neither. It is sacrosanct because it is about the flag that represents the God-given freedom we all have defended. I still stand at attention when I hear it. It is not a pop ballad or a soul tune. Nor is it a Broadway standard or a heavy metal song. It is not something that the American Idol judges should ever have to critique (though Randy would undoubtedly declare any rendition of it “pitchy”). It is a song about the courage and devotion shown by a group of Americans who in the course of a raging British naval bombardment refused to let the Stars and Stripes fall, no matter the cost to life and limb. And it became a song about the kind of nation we have been and still are, through war and peace, boom and bust. It is about the never-say-die, never-give-in, never-yield attitude that has been the hallmark of our national character and our military’s steadfast defense of freedom from Valley Forge to Fort McHenry to St. Lo to Inchon to Baghdad and Kandahar. It’s about firemen and policemen running into the World Trade Center on 9/11. It’s about that flag flying proudly and defiantly over the land of the free and the home of the brave. So, with all the kindness I can muster, I give this one piece of advice to the next pop star who is asked to sing the national anthem at a sporting event: save the vocal gymnastics and the physical gyrations for your concerts. Just sing this song the way you were taught to sing it in kindergarten — straight up, no styling. Sing it with the constant awareness that there are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines watching you from bases and outposts all over the world. Don’t make them cringe with your self-centered ego gratification. Sing it as if you are standing before a row of 86-year-old WWII vets wearing their Purple Hearts, Silver Stars and flag pins on their cardigans and you want them to be proud of you for honoring them and the country they love — not because you want them to think you are a superstar musician. They could see that from the costumes, the makeup and the entourages. Sing “The Star Spangled Banner” with the courtesy and humility that tells the audience that it is about America, not you.

"," This eRumor began circulating more than a year prior to Senator Edward (Teddy)  Kennedy’s death in August, 2009, but it was revived after he died on August 25, 2009 as a result of brain cancer. Serving in the US Senate for the state of Massachusetts from 1962 to 2009, Kennedy championed many controversial and liberal issues from abortion to immigration reform during his political career. According to a May 20, 2008 NPR article, after a seizure the Senator was diagnosed with a malignant t glioma, a form of brain cancer in May of 2008. The article said that treatment for this form of cancer usually involves surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Some of the points of this email appear to have been taken from a page about Senator Kennedy on the Who’s Who website www.nbdb.com. Some other comments might have been added by others who forwarded this email. Click for NBDB site. Let’s look at them one-at-a-time:: 1: Kennedy was caught cheating at Harvard and expelled twice, once for cheating on a test, and once for paying a classmate to cheat for him. Truth! and Fiction! Adam Clymer is a journalist who covered Washington for the New York Times who had been writing about Ted Kennedy since he played football for Harvard in the 1950’s. Clymer wrote a book called, Edward M. Kennedy: a biography based on personal interviews with the senator as well as published reports. According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy was expelled only once from Harvard, not twice, and he never paid a classmate to cheat for him. According to Clymer, it was in 1951 that Kennedy had a fellow student named Bill Frate take his Spanish exam. Kennedy was concerned his C -minus grade could result in his removal from the Harvard football team. Clymer said, there was no monetary compensation for the cheating episode and as a friend, Frate agreed to take the test in Kennedy’s name. Frate was recognized by a graduate student who proctored the exam when the exam was handed in. The two were reported to and shortly afterwards expelled from the university. They were told that they could reapply in one or two years if their conduct improved. Ted returned to Harvard after 1953 where he worked harder in his studies and earned an A minus in Spanish and eventually graduated with a Bachelors degree in 1956. 2. Kennedy enlisted in the Army for four years.  His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England, intervened to have his enlistment shortened to two years. Truth! According to Clymer’s book, Kennedy spent three or four weeks figuring out what he was going to do after his expulsion from Harvard and on June 25, 1951 enlisted in the U.S. Army.   The Korean War was already a year old and the young Kennedy, unaware of the student deferment policy signed induction papers for a four year term.   Having already lost a son in World War II, His father, Joseph Kennedy, was able to intervene in Teddy’s behalf and reduced his hitch in the Army by two years. 3. While in the Army, Kennedy was assigned to Paris but never advanced beyond the rank of Private. Truth! Clymer said that, after basic training at Fort Dix, in New Jersey Private Kennedy was assigned to Camp Gordon in Georgia for three months for military police training. There were a couple of incidents that resulted in a lot of latrine duty for Kennedy. Among them was a incident when on a cold night he tried to keep warm using a can of Sterno, a fuel made from jellied and denatured alcohol. It caused a fire when his sleeping bag ignited. Once again, at the intervention of Joe Kennedy, the Private was assigned as part of the honor guard for the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Paris, France. Kennedy received an honorable discharge from the US Army in 1953 at the rank of Private. 4. While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving four times. Unproven! Kennedy did attend the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville. His biographer said that Kennedy “drove wildly and got several speeding tickets.” The book also said that he once out ran a police car. 5. In 1964, Kennedy was legally intoxicated when his plane crashed.  He hospitalized for several months. The results of the blood alcohol test remained a “state secret” until in the 1980’s. Fiction! This makes it sound as though Kennedy was the pilot and that he was flying drunk. He was a passenger, however, and alcohol had nothing to do with either Kennedy or the accident. The plane crash happened on June 10, 1964. Kennedy, his wife Joan, Indiana Senator Birch Baye, Senator Baye’s wife, and Kennedy’s administrative assistant, Ed Moss, were being flown Washington D.C. to West Springfield, Massachusetts, the location of the Democratic Party Convention. The plane struck the ground during an instrument approach and a later investigation blamed the crash on pilot error. Kennedy was seriously injured in the crash, spent months in rehabilitation, and was plagued with back pain for the rest of his life. The eRumor said that Kennedy had been illegally impaired by alcohol during this crash but Ted Kennedy but he was not the pilot of this plane.   His Blood alcohol level would have no meaning in any investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), CAB or or National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) . 6. On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts and later  drove Mary Jo Kopechne home.  The car ran off the bridge, flipped, and into Poucha Pond and Kopechne drowned.   It is widely assumed Kennedy was drunk.   Kennedy was given a suspended sentence of two months. Truth! and Unproven! This is one of the most famous incidents in Kennedy’s life. It is true that a car that he was driving went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island on July 19, 1969 and that a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne died in the accident. According to Clymer’s book, it was a hot July day on the island and Kennedy had competed in the annual Edgartown Regatta, a sailboat race, earlier and finished in ninth place out of 31 boats. After the race, Kennedy returned to his hotel room, soaked his back in a hot bath and drank a rum and coke. He later went to a reunion of Robert Kennedy campaign workers which was also attended by Mary Jo Kopechne who worked for Robert Kennedy as a legislative aide. It is thought that Kopechne might have been feeling ill from exposure to the sun from the day’s events and Kennedy left the party with her after 11:00 PM to take her back to the inn where she was staying. The fatal accident took place a mile and a half from the cottage where the party was still taking place. The Oldsmobile that Kennedy had been driving went off the bridge on the right side, overturned and landed in the pond where it quickly submerged under the water. Kennedy managed to escape the sinking vehicle but Kopechne didn’t According to published reports, Kennedy stumbled back to the cottage and two other people from the party then went to the scene of the accident and tried to rescue Kopechne, but without success. One of the lingering controversies of the incident is that no one reported it to authorities. Police learned of it from two fishermen the next morning who happened upon the scene. The following day, when the police arrived on the scene and began their investigation Kennedy told them that he was not sure how he had escaped the submerged car and that he dove down to to the point of exhaustion see if his passenger was still in the car. Clymer wrote that the crash left Kennedy with a moderate brain concussion which resulted in memory failure and confusion. Kennedy was charged with leaving the scene of an accident to which he pleaded guilty. Kennedy testified in the inquest that he had only drank two drinks at the party. He was sentenced to 2 months jail time which was suspended. 8. Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years, but his accomplishments seem scant- Fiction! According to the http://www.govtrack.us web site , a civil project that tracks congressional and senate activities, Senator Kennedy Edward Kennedy sponsored 380 bills from Jan 14, 1991. and Aug 6, 2009.     At the time of this investigation 273 of these bills are still in committee and 24 have been successfully enacted. Kennedy also co-sponsored 2047 bills during this period. Kennedy was widely regarded as one of the most powerful senators of his time and below are some of his recently sponsored bills: S. 982: Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act Reported by Committee May 20, 2009 S. 277: Serve America Act Reported by Committee Mar 18, 2009 S. 1405: Longfellow House-Washington’s Headquarters National Historic Site Designation Act Introduced Jul 7, 2009 S. 1152: Healthy Families Act Introduced May 21, 2009 S. 1410: Time for Innovation Matters in Education Act of 2009 Introduced Jul 8, 2009 S.Res. 36: An original resolution authorizing expenditures by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.

Kennedy was prime instigator and author of every expansion of an increase in immigration, up to and including the latest attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Not to mention the pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court nominees- TRUTH! According to a August 27, 2009 CBS News article , immigration reform was a lifelong cause for Senator Kennedy and he “dramatically changed the United States’ immigration system with the Immigration Act of 1965, which eliminated the quota system and allowed immigration from Latin America and Asia to dramatically increase.”   The article said, “He also worked to pass the Refugee Act of 1980, and in 1986 he supported a measure that allowed nearly three million undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and established penalties against employers who hired illegal immigrants. He supported the Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the number of immigrants that could enter the country, including those who could enter with permanent job-related visas and temporary worker visas.” In 2007 Senators Kennedy cosponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 which failed passage. Because of timing of the original eRumor, it is believed that the two Supreme Court nominees mentioned were Chief Justice John G. Roberts (2005)  and Samuel A. Alito (2006).  Both justices were appointed by President George W. Bush, choices which Kennedy did not approve. The issue of abortion was the key focus in the confirmation hearing of Judge Alito.   In his closing comments during the hearing, Senator Kennedy said, “He didn’t back away one inch from his view that a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions is NOT protected under the Constitution.  He didn’t back away from his criticism of the principle of ‘one person, one vote.'” Kennedy added, “And on the cases he decided, in case after case, we see legal contortions and inconsistent reasoning to bend over backwards to help the powerful. He may cite instances in thish he thinks he helped the little guy. But the record is clear that the average person had a hard time getting a fair shake in Judge Alito’s courtroom.” After the death of William Rehnquist on September 23, 2005,  President George W. Bush nominated John G. Roberts to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. During Robert’s confirmation hearings for Chief Justice, Senator Kennedy said, ” I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of proof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the United States. Sadly, there is ample evidence in John Roberts’ record to indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country’s great march of progress toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has refused to release documents and information from his years in the Reagan Administration and in the first Bush Administration that might indicate otherwise, but without those records, we have no way of knowing.” Kennedy added, “John Roberts’s nomination are trying to force a nominee to adopt our “partisan” positions, to support our “causes,” to yield to our “special interest” agendas.” Kennedy also said, “Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most important functions. The future and the quality of life in this nation may literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a rubber stamp for the President’s nominees, if we put party over principle, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more important if we go along to get along with the White House we will be undermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish the great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and reasonable “no” vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for the Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our independent consciences tell us to do so.” Roberts attended Harvard Law School where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review and after passing his bar exam, served as a law clerk for William Rehnquist.   Roberts was confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and later swore into office of the President of the United States another former editor of the Harvard Law Review, Barack Hussein Obama. 10. He is known around Washington as a public drunk, loud, boisterous and very disrespectful to ladies- Mostly True! Kennedy had a well-known problem with alcohol and in his earlier years was described by some as a “womanizer” and a “drunk.” Biographer Edward Klein said Kennedy was “…like the playboy of the Western world.” Klein said that Kennedy could get attention in his family by being the clown. CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller described Kennedy as a prolific elder statesman on one side and a brazen bad boy on the other.” She also said that after Kennedy’s first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in 1980, his reputation with women and booze spun out of control. Klein described a drunken incident in Alaska in 1969. He said Kennedy began yelling “Es-ki-mo Power!” and saying things like “They’re going to shoot my ass off the way they shot Bobby…” After the trip John Lindsey of Newsweek called Kennedy family friend Lester Hyman and told him about the Alaska incident. He said “Your friend Ted Kennedy is in a lot of trouble psychologically.” He was known for his boisterousness and loudness. He was famous for spontaneously bursting forth into song—and at a high volume. In 1991, Time magazine called him a “Palm Beach Boozer” and GQ magazine described him as “an aging Irish boy clutching a bottle.” Most credit his second marriage to Victoria Reggie Kennedy in 1992 as marking a change for the better in his life. updated 09/01/09 ","Crime - Police"

It says that this would cloud up visibility and force drivers to pull over to the side of the road when water from the wiper tank is mixed with the eggs by your windshield wipers. "," A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff (LASD) told TruthOrFiction.Com that this is a hoax and that they did not send out this warning.   Some versions of the forwarded email appeared to have been sent from a deputy in the probation department for County of Los Angeles, CA.   The LASD spokesperson said that they are looking into the origins of this hoax and that the probation department does not even come under his organization. This eRumor actually evolved from another hoax about a similar warning from the Department of Corrections in Tennessee that said gangs were using bloodied dolls in infant car seats along the road to attract the attention of motorists.  The drivers would pull over to the side of the road to investigate the car seat as gang members were patiently waiting for their next victim. Click here for our findings. The LASD spokesperson did say that in any case where there is some sort of distraction to get the driver’s attention, such as an egg thrown at a windshield, it is always best not to pull over immediately. He added that drivers should always be aware of their surroundings when they pull over and exit their cars.    The law enforcement agency does suggest that divers should try to locate a local police station or well lit filling station to examine their cars for damages. Windshield washer tanks should not contain water.  The solutions in the reservoir tanks are designed to break down substances on automotive windshields and most tank lids and vehicle owner manuals warn against them being refilled with water.  In colder climates water will freeze in the solution which could result in other problems. updated 11/12/10 ","Crime - Police"

The case was referred to detectives for   further investigation. A police   report on the incident didn’t indicate what charges, if any, would   result from the investigation. The police report said Pearle Gordon, the   mother-in-law of McSpadden’s ex-husband, was among a group of street   vendors selling t-shirts and afghans on Florissant Street when the   incident unfolded on October 18, 2014. Gordon reported that McSpadden was among   a group of 20-30 people who “rushed” the street vendors to confront them   about selling the merchandise. According to police report: “Gordon told McSpadden she was Michael   Brown Sr.’s mother-in-law, and unless McSpadden could produce   documentation stating she had a patent on her son’s name, Gordon was   going to continue to sell her merchandise. Desureia Harris (McSpadden’s   mother) told Gordon ‘you don’t know my grandson like that’ … and Harris   then proceeded to rip down t-shirts and other items hanging on a line.” Gordon told police the vendors were   attacked and lost more than $1,500 in merchandise and $400 in cash in   the encounter.

"Muslims Are Meeting to Pray on the Capitol Steps on September 25, 2009-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:25","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jumamah-capitol-steps/"," A forwarded eRumor warning that Muslims will be gathering at the steps in front of the the US Capitol Building in Washington DC on September 25, 2009.   The email goes on to say that 50,000 are expected to attend to pray for 15 hours and that the organizers got their inspiration from President Obama’s speech in Cairo, Egypt where he said the United States was no longer a Christian Nation.  The eRumor also asks, “Do you think Christians would be allowed to do an event like this?” "," The prayer event is real and will take place on the steps of the US Capitol Building in Washington DC on September 25, 2009.   The event is being called Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill.   The official website is: http://www.islamoncapitolhill.com According to a September 14, 2009 World Bulletin article , Organizers have considered the Jummah Prayer on Capital Hill as a Day of Islamic Unity.”    The main organizer, Hassen Abdellah, expects 50,000 people of all faiths to be in attendance and told reporters that the event will solely consist of prayer, readings from the Koran and will not include political speeches or placards. The eRumor makes it appear that this approval of a Muslim prayer event on the Capitol steps is something favorable to Muslims that would not be granted to Christians.   Use of the US Capitol for religious events is not uncommon and a variety of events at the Capitol Steps are allowed as long as the permit applications are submitted and the guidelines are strictly followed. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, in his book “Rediscovering God in America”  said that Thomas Jefferson, author of the famous “the wall of separation of Church and State,” was the first U.S. President to allow the public use of the Capitol building religiously—and it was for church services.  Gingrich also wrote that In 1952 Congress issued a joint resolution calling for a prayer service on the Capitol steps which was led in the pouring rain by Rev. Billy Graham.   The event was attended by thousands of people which prompted the 1953 construction of a Congressional Chapel on the federal premises which today is only open to members of Congress and invited guests. Recent religious events at the Capitol steps include the 58th annual National Day of Prayer observance on May 7, 2009 which included a Bible reading marathon. 90 continuous hours of reading from the book of Genesis to the book of Revelation has taken place on the Capitol steps every year since 1979.  The Promise Keeper Organization of Christian Men also have met at the Capitol steps to pray. President Obama has taken a lot of hits for a statement he made in his 2009 trip to Turkey. Critics of the president have said that he declared the United States “no longer a Christian nation” and that he said that the U.S. was a “Moslem nation.” His exact remark was, “I’ve said before that one of the great strengths of the United States is…that although we have a very large Christian population, we do not consider ourselves a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation we consider ourselves a nation of citizens.” Critics of the president considered his remarks a rejection of the long-held belief that America is a Christian nation. Supporters pointed out that he wasn’t discounting Christianity or elevating Islam. He was emphasizing the unity of a country of diverse citizens with diverse faiths. The president’s statement echoed his belief when Obama was an Illinois State Senator he was the keynote speaker at the “Building a Covenant for A New America” conference sponsored by a group called the “Call to Renewal.” He told attendees that the United States is no longer a Christian nation but a nation of citizens with different beliefs. President Obama also said this on a 2009 trip to Cairo, Egypt Islamic Prayer Day at the White House – Fiction! Another version of this eRumor began circulating in December of 2009 saying that the Islamic Day of Prayer was at the White House. It also included a picture of the President removing his shoes in apparent preparation for  prayer. This Islamic prayer gathering, as we reported above, did not take place at the White House and the picture had nothing to do with that event.  The photo was taken when  President Obama toured a mosque in Turkey during his April 2009 tour.

"Discussion of Canadian Health Care-Mostly Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:24","https://www.truthorfiction.com/hillarys-health-care-plan/"," Prompted by Senator Hillary Clinton’s health care proposals, the writer of the eRumor says all is not well in Canada where a universal health care plan has been in effect for a long time. "," This is a complex story and some of it, such as whether Senator Hillary Clinton’s health    care proposals have merit, is a matter of political, social, and economic    opinion. We don’t have a name for the writer of this eRumor or whether it was    really written from Canada or not, but we can look into some of the    specific topics it raises. First, health care polices and prices in    Canada may differ    from province to province.  The national government sends health care    dollars to the provinces but the provincial and territorial governments each establish    their own guidelines. Some of the topics in the eRumor are personal and about people in the    writer’s family and we can’t document those.  Other topics are    commentary, but here are some of the issues raised: Canadian health care is not free and is    funded mostly by taxes- Truth! Most Canadians pay an annual health care    premium that averages several hundred dollars per month.  Low income    families and those on assistance are exempted.  But the bulk of    health care costs is paid for by taxes.  Whether the writer is really    in a 55% tax bracket or not is not known.  The Canadian Federal    Finance Department estimates, however, that Canadians pay an average of    35% to 40% in income taxes. There are long waiting lists for treatment in Canada- Truth! Even the most enthusiastic of Canadians    admit that the health care system can be sluggish when it comes to getting    treatment.  It’s technically illegal for doctors and hospitals to    provide private care for anything that is covered by the government health    care system, but there is a growing industry of private hospitals where    people can pay for services that they would otherwise have to wait a long    time to get. Many Canadians do not have a family doctor- Truth! Most Canadians do have a family doctor    but if you don’t have one, finding one may be difficult.  There is a    shortage of physicians in Canada and you must find a family doctor who is    accepting new patients.  In 2004 the Canadian Medical Association    estimated that about 14% of Canadians did not have a family physician. You could wait many hours in an    emergency room for treatment- Truth! Almost anybody anywhere in the    world has stories of long waits in emergency rooms–mostly because unless    your problem is life-threatening you’ll not get the attention of those who    are facing more serious problems.  But is is true that in Canada the    lines at emergency rooms are legendarily long. Immigrants get health care coverage in    Canada- Truth! According to the Canadian    Government, immigrants are eligible for health care coverage under the    Canada Health Act, although in some provinces there may be a 90-day    waiting period. Drug addicts get free needles but diabetics must pay for needles in    Canada- Truth! & Fiction! The Canadian government began    needle exchange programs in several areas of Canada in the 1980’s.     The goal was to fight the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C by reducing the    number of contaminated needles being used.  Medical supplies for    diabetics, however, including needles are covered by the health plan.

"Deandre Joshua Was Murdered over Grand Jury Testimony – Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/deandre-joshua-murdered/"," Grand jury witness DeAndre Joshua was murdered in Ferguson, Missouri, because former Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted in the shooting death of Michael Brown. "," The motive for Deandre Joshua’s murder isn’t known, but it’s clear that Joshua wasn’t a grand jury witness. The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office told the Washington Post that, “He was not a witness.” Joshua’s family and friends backed that claim up, too. Joshua, 20, was found murdered the morning after violent protests erupted in Ferguson on November 24, 2014. Joshua had been shot in the head, and his body was partially burned, USA Today reports . Reports that Joshua’s murder was linked to grand jury testimony swept the web after it was revealed that he was a friend of Dorian Johnson, the man who was with Brown on the night of his death. Joshua was also murdered in a car parked near the same apartment complex where Brown died, which fueled further speculation, Politico reports . However, Joshua’s former girlfriend told the New York Times she was with him at a beauty salon when he learned Brown had died. Joshua’s family also said he was nowhere near Brown the night he died and that Joshua would have had nothing to testify about. Also, even if Joshua had testified, nobody would have known. The grand jury witness list is sealed and records are heavily redacted, the Boston Globe reports . Wilson and Dr. Michael Baden, who performed Brown’s autopsy, are the only known witnesses who testified. But the time, location and manner of Joshua’s murder will continue to fuel speculation that his death was related to the grand jury’s decision — whether Joshua testified or not. Police haven’t ruled that possibility out, either. St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar said there could be “a nexus” between the unrest in Ferguson and Joshua’s murder. But police said it’s unclear if there’s a direct link or not. Future updates to this story will be posted here. ","Crime - Police"

"Dogs Were Used for Shark Bait by Fishermen on African Island-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dogs-sharkbait/"," A forwarded email warning that dogs are used as shark bait by fishermen on the island of Réunion that lies off the coast of Africa.  It includes a plea to sign a petition to stop this cruel act. "," According to a National Geographic article published October 19, 2005, there were at least three cases discovered of dogs being used for shark bait on the island of Réunion.   The island is under French control and lies off the east coast of the African Continent. Click for article The article said that Reha Hutin, the president of Paris based Foundation 30 Millions d’Amis (the Thirty Million Friends Foundation) sent a film crew to the small volcanic island to document claims that live animals were being used by fishermen to catch sharks. They discovered that stray dogs and cats on the island are viewed as vermin and the foundation plans to finance a sterilization program to reduce the population of strays. This still video photograph was in the National Geographic article taken by Thirty Million Friends Foundation. This dog managed to escape fishermen before it could be used as live bait and was lucky enough to be found and taken for medical attention. He is shown here as a veterinarian prepares to remove the hook from it’s snout.   The operation was a success and the dog is now at home with its owners. Fabienne Jouve  is a spokesperson for the French animal rights organization, Groupement de Réflexion et d’Action pour l’Animal (GRAAL). He noted that, “Lately, almost every week, one dog has been found with hooks on the island, not counting the cats found on the beaches partially eaten by the sharks.” This barbaric act isn’t just as simple as running a hook through the stray animals and tossing them over the side of their boats.  In order for the fishermen to entice the carnivorous predators off their coast they hook the dogs snouts and paws and let them bleed out for at least a day. The article said that several animal rights activist groups have known about the inhumane practice of using live dogs for shark bait and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation has been fighting this for a decade.  Patti Davis, daughter of President Ronald Reagam wrote a web-exclusive commentary in Newsweek about this in October of 2005. The Friday Harbor, Washington based Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has offered “a U.S. $1,000 reward to any Réunion police officer who arrests anyone using live dogs or cats as bait for sharks.” In September of 2005, the government of Réunion responded to the outcries by passing into law a bill that would make it illegal for fishing boats to carry any dogs or cats, alive or dead. Shortly after the law was enacted the article said “the first court case was held involving a person charged with using live dogs as bait. Authorities had found a seven-month-old puppy on John Claude Clain’s property in July with three fishing hooks in its paws and snout.”  This resulted in a 5000 euro fine  for Clain. The article also said that “Both the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the United Kingdom and the Thirty Million Friends Foundation are asking animal lovers to sign a petition urging the French government to step up enforcement of laws against the use of live dogs as bait.” Click here for petition. updated 02/16/09 ","Crime - Police"

"The Brutal Murders of Christopher Newsom and Channon Christian-Truth!","2015-03-17 18:06:19","https://www.truthorfiction.com/christopher-channon/"," The eRumor tells of the horrific kidnapping, torture, and murder of Christopher Newsom and his girlfriend Channon Christian from Knoxville, Tennessee. The story claims that she was forced to watch as Christian’s penis was cut off, he was set on fire, and shot several times.  Then she was allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted for 4 days, chemicals put into her mouth, her breast cut off, then murdered.  According to the eRumor, five people have been arrested for the crimes.  The eRumor asks questions like why the media has not covered the the story more widely such as the Duke University rape case, why people like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are not helping the victim’s families, why the ACLU and the NAACP are not calling for an investigation, and why the FBI is not looking into it as a hate crime.  Then it answers those questions by saying that it must be because the victims were white and the suspects were black. "," Although some of the details of the eRumor are not confirmed, the tragic story of the murders of Christoper Newsom and Channon Christian is true. Authorities say both were raped, tortured, and murdered after being kidnapped on the morning of January 7, 2007.  Four people were convicted and sentenced for their involvement in this crime.   Letalvis Cobbins was found guilty of first degree murder and rape in August 2009 and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.    Lemaricus Davidson was found guilty of first degree murder and rape in October 2009.  Davidson is on death row awaiting his death sentence by lethal injection to be carried out.  George Thomas, after having been found guilty of first degree murder and rape in December 2009 was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  In May 2010 Vanessa Coleman was found not guilty of first degree murder but was found guilty of being a facilitator in the rape and death of Channon Christian.   Coleman was sentence to 53 years in prison. According to published reports, Newsom and Christian went out for dinner on the evening of Saturday, January 6, 2007.  Police say their car was hijacked and the couple was tired up and taken to the apartment of one of the suspects.  There Christian was reportedly raped in Newsom’s presence then Newsom was shot and his body burned.  Police have not confirmed that his penis was cut off and we have not found any credible source for that information.  Police later found a fingerprint on an envelope in Christian’s abandoned car, which led them to the apartment and where they found Christian’s body in a trash can in the kitchen.  She had been dismembered.  Again, police have not confirmed the mutilation of her breast.  Investigators say they later determined that she had been held for at least two days during which she was tortured, raped, and murdered.  Newsom’s body was found by a railroad worker near some railroad tracks in East Knoxville. The story has been covered by both local and national media but not with the intensity of something like the Duke University rape case, in which three white students were charged with raping a black stripper at a party in March, 2006.  All the charges against the students were eventually dropped but the case generated a lot of visibility and controversy along racial lines. The murders of Newsom and Christian have become better known through forwarded emails and blogs than from national media.  It would be difficult, however, to argue that it is because of racial bias.  The O.J. Simpson murder trial was one of the most intensively covered crimes involving a black defendant with white victims.  Rich Buhler, the founder of TruthOrFiction.com, has worked in the news media for more than 40 years.  He said, “There are heartbreaking and horrifying crimes all over the nation every day that you don’t hear about until, for example, you watch a true crime show or read a true crime book.  Newsom and Christian were not only victims of human monsters but also became crime statistics that are, very tragically, all too common.” updated 4/11/12 ","Crime - Police"

"," This eRumor started circulating in 2006 and has been one of the most widely circulated emails on the Internet. It is not true, however.  It is a hoax. Ashley Flores is real and, at this writing, is alive and well and was never a missing teenager.  The email saying that she was missing was sent as a joke by one of her close friends.

We did find pictures on social networking sites of a girl who looked similar to the one whose picture was circulated with the eRumor and who had the name Ashley Flores.  Following those leads we were able to find the person who actually created the Ashley Flores email and get a little of the background on the story.  That was an oddity because tracking down the creators of some of the biggest eRumors is usually virtually impossible. Her name is Vickie and both she and Ashley are from Philadelphia.  Vickie told TruthOrFiction.com that it all started on Myspace.com when someone posted a bulletin about a missing girl.  Vickie thought it would be fun to replace the picture and the identifying information with that of her best friend–Ashley Flores.  Vickie said she did it with Ashley’s permission and posted it just once on Myspace.  From there it jumped to forwarded emails and the rest is history.  She said she thought that both her and Ashley’s friends would get a kick out of seeing Ashley pictured as a missing person and they all got a chuckle out of it–without realizing how big this would all get.

"Call the police to an ATM machine by entering your PIN backwards-Fiction!","2015-03-17 18:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/atm-911/"," An alert that if you ever find yourself in a scary situation at a banking ATM machine, such as a thief forcing you to withdraw cash, just enter your personal identification number (PIN) backwards. That will automatically send a message to the police that you are in trouble and they will respond to the machine.  The eRumor says that most people don’t know about this. "," The eRumor is false because there isn’t anywhere that we could find where this emergency procedure at ATM machines is actually being used. There is a seed of truth to it, however, in that the idea has been floating around for a while.  One of the biggest proponents has been in Illinois attorney named Joseph Zingher. He says the notion came to him when he was a law student at the University of Illinois and one evening was withdrawing money from an ATM in a scary part of town.  He patented his concept in 1998 and has been trying to talk banks into using it ever since. Under Zingher’s system, every ATM account would have two PIN numbers—the normal PIN used to withdraw money and what he calls the “ATM SafetyPIN” to alert police that something bad was happening at the ATM.  It has also come to be popularly called the “Panic PIN.”  The SafetyPIN would typically be the reverse of the normal PIN number or some other variation that would be easy to remember.  Legislation was passed in Illinois that would allow banks to adopt the system, but did not mandate it.  So far, no banks or financial institutions have done so.  Zingher has offered to let Illinois-based banks to use it for free but some of them have said they think it would be too expensive and that ATM crime is not frequent enough.  Zingher says that ATM crime is much higher than believed because not all crime reporting reflects whether it has taken place in connection with an ATM or forced withdrawal of cash.

Mr. Petruna told us that he sent this to a few friends and that he never intended for it to become so widely distributed.   As we looked more thoroughly into the story, some of the details related by Petruna were in conflict with what we were told by Air Tran airlines and local media accounts.

Then on 12/4/09 Air Tran issued a statement saying that they had checked the flight manifest and “that the individual that allegedly created a first-hand account of events on-board Air Tran Airways flight 297, a Theodore Petruna, was never actually on-board the flight.” According to the report, the flight that Petruna was on from Ohio landed in Atlanta 26 minutes after AirTran 297 left the gate.

According to a report by the NBC News affiliated in Atlanta, GA, here is a chain events that led to the incident of Flight 297: A group of 12 “non-English speaking” passengers and their translator boarded the AirTran flight to Houston in Atlanta. When the plane began to taxi to the runway one of the non-English speakers was spotted by a flight attendant using his cellular phone. His translator was many rows back so was unable to tell the caller of the Federal Aviation Administration rules that requires all electronic devices to be turned off during take off and landing. Not understanding what the flight attendant was saying, the caller continued his conversation. This resulted in the flight attendant alerting the captain of the jetliner, who decided to return the plane to the terminal. Once safely at the terminal, the caller and the translator were asked to exit the aircraft and the rest of the non-English speaking group followed. When the mix-up was all sorted out all members of the group were allowed to return to the aircraft which was still at the terminal. At that time, twelve other passengers who were waiting on the plane “decided they didn’t want to fly on the plane and they all got off.” The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident but nobody was detained and no charges were filed.

"Michigan Bill Could Deny Gay People Medical Care – Fiction! & Disputed!","2015-03-17 17:52:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/michigan-bill-could-deny-gay-people-medical-care/"," A bill would enable medical providers in Michigan to deny care to gay people based on religious beliefs. "," It’s true that a bill in Michigan could limit the state’s ability to interfere with individuals’ religious beliefs, but it doesn’t specifically address medical providers or gay people. Still, critics argue that the bill could pave the way for discrimination based on things like sexual orientation and religious beliefs in healthcare and other areas. The bill in question is HB 5958 , more commonly known as the Michigan Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA): “A bill to limit governmental action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion; to set forth legislative findings; to provide for asserting a burden on exercise of religion as a claim or defense in any judicial or administrative proceeding; and to provide remedies.” The eRumor’s claim that the bill could lead to healthcare providers denying care to gay people started as one of the hypothetical situations cited by Michigan RFRA’s critics. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan, for example, said : “(The bill) would allow people to put their religious beliefs ahead on the public good. If it passes, it will permit people to take advantage of the law to claim that their religion gives them the right to ignore criminal and civil laws — non-discrimination laws, child abuse laws and domestic violence laws. This means a police officer could refuse to defend a mosque or synagogue, a school guidance counselor could deny help to a gay student, a landlord could refuse to rent to a single mother, or a man could claim that he has a religious right to discipline his wife and kids as he sees fit — all based on their religious beliefs.” But Republican State Rep. Jase Bolger, who sponsored the Michigan RFRA, countered that the bill would establish a “two-part balance test” in a prepared statement : “The individual must show they have a sincerely held religious belief that has been substantially burdened. On balance, the government must show it has a compelling interest that cannot be achieved in a less restrictive way before it can overrule an individual’s religious beliefs.” Michigan’s RFRA is based on a federal version of the legislation that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993 in an effort to protect religious minorities. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 1997 case that the federal RFRA could not be applied to local and state governments. The federal RFRA returned to the spotlight in October of 2013 when it served as the foundation for a U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the government couldn’t force Hobby Lobby to provide certain forms of birth control to its employees under the Affordable Care Act. Michigan’s RFRA has been approved by the Michigan House of Representatives. It must be approved by the Michigan Senate and signed by Gov. Rick Snyder to become law.","Crime - Police"

"Illinois Law Makes it Illegal to Record Police-Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illinois-law-makes-it-illegal-to-record-police/"," A new law in Illinois makes it illegal for people to record all interactions with police officers. "," It’s not true that it would be illegal to record all interactions with police officers under a bill approved by the Illinois legislature. The measure would, however, make it illegal to record private conversations with cops and government officials. Critics argue that it would be hard for the public to understand the difference between “public” and “private” interactions under the law. At the center of the eRumor is an amendment to Senate Bill 1342. The bill, which was approved by the state legislature on December 2, 2014, overhauls the Illinois Eavesdropping Act , which was struck down by the Illinois Supreme Court in March of 2014. The state’s high court found that the act “burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to serve a legitimate state interest in protecting conversational privacy.” The decision continued: “The statute as now written deems all conversations to be private and, thus, not subject to recording absent consent, even if the participants have no expectation of privacy. The State argues that the choice between a law that might be over-inclusive and one that might be under-inclusive is a policy matter for the legislature, not the courts. When that policy criminalizes a wide range of innocent conduct, however, it cannot be sustained. The statute criminalizes the recording of conversations that cannot be deemed private: a loud argument on the street, a political debate on a college quad, yelling fans at an athletic event, or any conversation loud enough that the speakers should expect to be heard by others. None of these examples implicate privacy interests, yet the statute makes it a felony to audio record each one. Judged in terms of the legislative purpose of protecting conversational privacy, the statute’s scope is simply too broad.” The amendment to Senate Bill 1342 addresses the recording of private — not public — interactions between police officers and citizens. The amendment also applies to police and police informants secretly recording suspects during an investigation. According to the amendment: “For the purposes of this Article, ‘private the term conversation’ means any oral communication between two or more persons, whether in person or transmitted between the parties by wire or other means, when regardless of whether one or more of the parties intended the their communication to be of a private nature under circumstances reasonably justifying that expectation. A reasonable expectation shall include any expectation recognized by law, including, but not limited to, an expectation derived from a privilege, immunity or right established by common law, Supreme Court rule, or the Illinois or United States Constitution.” The amendment doesn’t re-write the definition of “expectation of privacy.” It’s determined on a case-by-case basis under federal law using loose criteria, Cornell University Law School reports : “The Fourth Amendment protects people from warrantless searches of places or seizures of persons or objects, in which they have an subjective expectation of privacy that is deemed reasonable in public norms. The reasonableness standard is construed upon the totality of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. The person’s precautions taken to exclude others’ access are strong indicators to the expectation of privacy and might be taken into consideration by the court. The legitimate expectation of privacy must have a independent source outside Fourth Amendment. For example, private homes are at the core of Fourth Amendment protection subject to a few exceptions, as they are closely associated with the ownership interest in property law.” However, critics of the Illinois statute argue that its definition of “reasonable expectation of privacy” is overly vague. As the law is written, it could be legal for someone to record a police officer in their own home, but not in a home that they are visiting. It could also be legal to record a police officer on a sidewalk, but not inside a police car parked next to the sidewalk. The independent Illinois Policy Institute argued that the law’s vagueness would leave the public in the dark about when it’s legal and illegal to record police officers: “Under the new bill, a citizen could rarely be sure whether recording any given conversation without permission is legal. The bill would make it a felony to surreptitiously record any ‘private conversation,’ which it defines as any ‘oral communication between 2 or more persons,’ where at least one person involved had a ‘reasonable expectation’ of privacy. When does the person you’re talking to have a reasonable expectation of privacy? The bill doesn’t say. And that’s not something an ordinary person can be expected to figure out. A law must be clear enough for citizens to know in advance whether a particular action is a crime. This bill doesn’t meet that standard, which should be reason enough for a court to strike it down if it becomes law.” However, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois applauded the legislature’s passage of the bill: “It is good that the new eavesdropping statute enacted during the veto session generally protects our reasonable expectations of privacy in our conversations, phone calls and electronic communications from unwanted recording or interception, and that it does so without intruding on our First Amendment right to expose government misconduct by recording the non-private conversations of on-duty government officials. The new statute does this by prohibiting the recording and intercepting of only private conversations, unless there is all-party consent or a warrant. So the new statute generally provides that police, informants or other members of the public cannot record our private conversations without our permission. Also, we cannot be arrested or prosecuted under the new statute for recording on-duty government officials who are talking to the public as part of their jobs, because those conversations are not private. In conclusion, the law approved by the Illinois legislature wouldn’t make it illegal to record police officers or government officials in public venues, but critics argue that the vagueness of the law makes it impossible to determine what’s public and what’s private.

"List of Facts and Figures about Illegal Immigration-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/illegal-aliens/"," The eRumor claims to have a list of alarming facts about Illegal immigration. "," Illegal immigration is a significant issue for Americans and deserves attention, but whoever authored this eRumor did not help his or her cause.  Most of the figures are either difficult to prove or don’t match known facts.  Some seem to be fabricated. A couple actually proved their point even better than the statistics quoted. Some versions say the figures are from the Los Angeles Times (which is not true).  Others say they are statistics from the FBI (which is not true either). One of the challenges with this topic is that illegal immigrants are somewhat invisible to statistics.  They are living underground and the best figures about illegal immigrants are mostly based on deductions from those who are either in professional positions working with immigrant issues or doing research on immigration.  None of the estimates should be considered the last word on illegal immigration and the figures we found sometimes varied widely. Here is our research on each of the points of the email: 1. 40% of all workers in L.A. County (L.A. County has 10.2 million people) Fiction! Economic Roundtable in Los Angeles issued a report in 2005 on what it called “L.A’s Off-The-Books labor force.”  Its research was about the city of Los Angeles, not the entire county, and concluded that there were 3,908,000 wage earners in the city and about 972,000 “informal workers,” meaning they were getting paid under the table.  It does not break down how many of them might have been illegal aliens, but the percentage was no where near 40 percent.  Los Angeles Almanac estimated number of “unreported jobs” in 2005 in Los Angeles County at 643,000 with a number of workers at 4,090.630. 2. 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens- Mostly Truth! The most commonly quoted source for this is a report by Heather McDonald and published by the Center for Immigration Studies.  She repeated her research on April 13, 2005 in testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on “Immigration, Border Security, and Claims” saying that 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide in Los Angeles targeted illegal aliens. 3. 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens- Unproven! We could not find anything to substantiate this.  If you browse through the Most Wanted list for the Los Angeles Police Department there are a lot of foreign-born listed, but not how many of them may be illegal aliens. 4. Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers- Inaccurate! According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, about half the births in Los Angeles County in 2004 were to undocumented women.  In 1989 California required by law that the state  Medi-Cal program be available to pregnant women living in poverty. 5. Nearly 25% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals here illegally- Fiction! National statistics would tend to suggest that this claim is not true.  A 2007 report by the Immigration Policy Center said that among men 18-39, which represents the majority of prison inmates, the incarceration rate of foreign born was 0.7 percent while the incarceration rate of native born was 3.5 percent.   Foreign born Mexicans had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent in 2000 compared with 5.9 percent for native born men of Mexican descent.  The report did not say how many of the foreign born were illegal.  A 1993 report to the California Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations estimated that more than 15 percent of the 116,000 state prison inmates were illegal aliens.  In her congressional testimony (referenced above), Heather McDonald said that the L.A. County Sheriff reported in 2000 that 23% of inmates in county jails were deportable, according to the New York Times.  That’s all inmates, however, not just Mexicans. 6. Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages- Unproven!

"Gang members hiding in the back seats of cars to kidnap women-Mostly Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:52:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/gangkidnap/"," A warning is being issued by police in major cities about gang members who are kidnapping women to rape or kill.  It’s part of a gang initiation ritual and the gang members are hiding in the back seats of women’s cars.  The story came to light when a gas station attendant spotted a man in the rear seat of a car, warned the woman and called police. "," No such threat has been documented and for most of the time this eRumor has circulated, there has never been any substantiation of any law enforcement agency issuing such a warning or even reporting such a story involving gangs or initiations. In September, 2007, however, police in Decatur, Alabama, said they had a report of an event that was similar.  According to the Decatur Daily News, a 23-year-old woman said that she ended up with a would-be kidnapper in the back seat of her SUV.  She said that she had just completed an evening college class and was talking on the phone while driving away from the campus.  A man sat up in the back seat and said he wanted her to take him somewhere.  As he started climbing over the seat into the front of the SUV, she slammed on her brakes, put the car in park, and got out.  The man grabbed a pack of cigarettes, got out of the car, and walked away.  The driver said he appeared to have had a gun.  She said she had locked her car while attending the college class and theorized that the man had actually gotten into her car when she stopped at a grocery store earlier in the evening. One of our staff members here at TruthOrFiction.com remembers dealing with this story in Los Angeles in the early 1970’s.  It’s gone through various versions, but always includes a menacing man in the back seat spotted by an alert gas station attendant.  Some stories say it’s a gang member who is going to kidnap and rape the woman.  Others say it’s a serial killer.  Others say the gang members are supposed to kill the woman and take one body part or another as a part of an initiation.

"," It’s true that members of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) participated in the Black Lives Matter rallies that followed the deaths of Eric Gardner and Michael Brown. The group’s participation hasn’t, however, been welcomed. Politicians and rally organizers have been at odds with the RCP and have called members of the group “opportunists” who use public outrage to advance a communist agenda, Gawker reports . A claim that the RCP was providing protest signs and was participating in Black Lives Matter rallies started immediately after a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, opted not to pursue charges in the shooting death of Michael Brown. A photographer for Getty Images captured a photo of a protest in New York City on December 1, 2014, that showed two protestors holding signs that read: Ferguson is Everywhere Police Brutality and Murder MUST STOP! revcom.us The web address for the RCP is revcom.us . The group uses the site to publish digital copies of its newspaper, Revolution. According to the site : “Through publishing works of Bob Avakian, and through many different articles, interviews, letters, graphics, and other features, Revolution newspaper enables people to really understand and act to radically change the world. It gives people a living picture and scientific analysis of what is going on in the world, and why. It exposes the true nature of this system, and shows how major events in society and the world are concentrations of the basic contradictions of this oppressive and putrid system. It brings alive the need and possibility for revolution and a whole new society and world…” It’s not known if the RCP undertook a coordinated effort to provide signs to protestors, or if individual members of the group added the web address to their signs independently. TruthorFiciton.com has reached out to the RCP for comment, and future updates will be posted here. And while the RCP’s web address appeared on just a handful of protest signs, a secondary eRumor emerged that the address and been airbrushed out of many more pictures. There’s no evidence to support that claim at this time. Whatever level of involvement the RCP has undertaken in the rallies, so far it’s been unwelcome. Local politicians and rally organizers have criticized the group’s participation since Brown’s death in August of 2014, Gawker reports : “Over the last few days, a great deal of the social media chatter on the crisis has identified another group increasing the tension: the Revolutionary Communist Party. RCP members, as the rumor goes, have parachuted into Ferguson and are trying to incite a riot. “The person who has been most vigorously documenting the RCP’s involvement is St. Louis Alderman Antonio French. Last night, for example, he posted this Vine of a local leader arguing with two men in telltale RCP black t-shirts.” A similar YouTube video also shows an RCP member at a rally in Ferguson yelling, “How many of you pigs already have bodies on you, have already killed people?” ","Crime - Police"

There is no author listed, so TruthorFiction.com can’t confirm that it was authored by someone who attended Kyle’s funeral or memorials services. Still, many of the details can be confirmed. Kyle gained a reputation as on of the most deadly snipers in military history during four combat tours as a Navy SEAL. Later, he wrote about his experiences in the book, “ American Sniper ,” which Clint Eastwood made into a movie starring Bradley Cooper. Kyle devoted much of his time (and all the proceeds from his book) to helping veterans overcome the emotional trauma of war. It was one of those veterans, 25-year-old Eddie Ray Routh, who took Kyle’s life in 2013, the New York Times reports : Far from a war zone,  Mr. Routh turned on Mr. Kyle, 38, and a second man, Chad  Littlefield, 35, shortly after they arrived at an exclusive shooting  range near Glen Rose, Tex., about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth,  law enforcement authorities said Sunday. The officials said that for  reasons that were still unclear, Mr. Routh shot and killed both men  with a semiautomatic handgun before fleeing in a pickup truck  belonging to Mr. Kyle. “Chad and Chris had taken a veteran out to shoot to try to help him,” said Travis Cox, a friend of Mr. Kyle’s. “And they were killed.” Kyle’s murder was a shock that extended beyond military circles. His military service and advocacy for veterans had made him into a household name across the country. An outpouring of public support came as funeral arrangements were made. Many details of Kyle’s funeral reported in the email can be confirmed. The funeral was held at Cowboys Stadium, and more than 7,000 people attended.

"," This mailer is from officer Stephanie Mohr who is in prison and appealing a conviction that resulted from an incident with her police dog on 9/21/95. According to court records, an officer was doing surveillance in an area of Prince George’s County where burglaries had been taking place. When he spotted two men on top of a building, he radioed for help and someone, in turn, asked for a K-9 (dog) unit.  Officers Stephanie Mohr and Anthony Delozier, along with a Maryland State Police helicopter, all showed up at the scene. The two suspects were arrested and charged with burglary.  The charges were later dismissed against one of them.  The other pleaded guilty. In 2000, the suspect whose charges had been dismissed brought action against Mohr and her partner with violating the law by “acting under color of law to willfully deprive him of his right to be free from the use of unreasonable force.”  Both were also charged with conspiracy.  In the trial Officer Mohr said that one of the suspects did not raise his hands as ordered and did not follow her orders to stop when he came down from the roof.  She says that his body motions indicated to her that he was beginning to flee in a direction where there were no officers.  She says she told him to stop then released the dog to handle it.  The result was that the suspect was bitten by the dog.  Prosecution witnesses said they remembered it differently.  The officer who originally requested the assistance, Sgt. Dennis Bonn, among others, testified that the two suspects came from the roof peacefully, with their hands in the air, and did as they were told.  He says the dog was released on the suspects as they stood cooperatively with their hands up. The jury dropped the conspiracy charge against Mohr and the violation of rights charge against her partner but could not agree on the violation of rights charge against Mohr or the conspiracy charge against her partner.  A mistrial was declared.  The second trial convicted Mohr of the violation of rights charge and cleared her partner of the conspiracy charge.  She was sentenced to 120 months in prison. Officer Mohr says she’s been the target of zealous prosecutors who are looking for cases of civil rights violations against minorities and that some testimony against her has been stacked against her.  Critics of Mohr say she was part of a pattern of officers whose dogs had bitten cooperative suspects.

Summary of original eRumor: This began on the eRumor     underground with several different versions, but they all pointed to     a rally to be held in New Delhi, India, on November 4 at which up to     one million Hindus planned to renounce their Hindu faith.  Most     versions also said that a presentation of Christianity was to be made at the rally by Dr. Rochunga Podiate, a native of India     who is a Christian leader living in the United States. "," 11/6/01  The       historic rally on November 4 in New Delhi featuring a mass       conversion of Hindus to Buddhism has taken place, but not in the way       that had been planned. The best article we’ve seen about the event is from Assist News       Service and David Hagen: November 5, 2001 INDIA’S DALITS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM       FROM HYPE AND OPPRESSION By:  David Hagen 4th Watch , Goshen, IN Special for Assist News Service GOSHEN, IN (ANS) — Leaders of India’s 290 million Dalits –       the “Oppressed” or “untouchables”– are leading them to       “quit Hinduism” to gain freedom and dignity. Their freedom of       religion, assembly and speech are threatened as India’s BJP       Government is pressured into dictatorial acts by its coercive       radical Hindu core constituency. This week, these tectonic struggles       have been shaking the foundations of Hinduism and India’s body       politic. In 1935, Dalit Dr. Ambedkar declared: “I was born a Hindu; I had       no choice. But I will not die a Hindu because I do have a choice.”       As Chairman of India’s Constituent Assembly, he codified freedom       of religion, legal equality and abolished caste discrimination in       India’s 1949 Constitution. (In Aug. 2001, Hindu Nepal enforced       this constitutional ban on caste discrimination.) Dr. Ambedkar found       that even constitutional rights were insufficient to ensure freedom       and dignity. On Oct. 14, 1954 he led 300,000 Dalits to leave       Hinduism and become Buddhists. Since 1997, Ram Raj, leader of India’s Dalit government workers,       has been repeating Dr. Ambedkar’s appeal, calling on Dalits to       “quit Hinduism”. There are at least three Christians for every       Buddhist in India (possibly twice that). Recognizing that not all       would become Buddhists, Ram Raj asked Buddhist, Christian and Moslem       leaders to join in giving nationwide calls for Dalits to leave       Hinduism and join non-casteist religions. Ram Raj founded the Lord Buddha Club in 1996. In       1997, he formed the “All India Confederation of SC/ST       Organizations” – “AICSSO” (“Scheduled Castes and Scheduled       Tribes” – Dalits for whom India reserves a portion of government       jobs.) In June, 2001 AICSSO leaders announced that 1 million Dalits       would quit Hinduism for Buddhism with a rally to be held on Oct. 14th,       2001. When that date for New Delhi’s Ram Lila grounds was       unavailable, the rally was rescheduled for Nov. 4th. On Sept. 7th, 749 delegates of the All India Christian       Council met in Hyderabad with Ram Raj and 25 other Dalit leaders. In       the Hyderabad Statement they declared solidarity with the Dalits and       Marginalized Sectors. Dalit leaders expressed willingness for Dalits       to become Christians. Again on Oct. 23, 700 Dalit and Christian       leaders met in Bangalore. Church leaders repented of past failures       and committed to help the Dalits. Gospel for Asia posted news of the rally plans and these events on http://www.gfa.org/revival requesting prayer and assistance.  Dr. Rochunga Pudaite, Bibles       for the World, similarly posted his expectations to speak at the       rally and distribute 1 million gospels. CBN, ChristianUnity and       other sites repeated this news. Emails multiplied calling for       prayer. However, headlines were sensationalized to “1 million to       convert to Christianity on Nov. 4th”, and “300       million on the verge of converting to Christianity” with other       false statements. Rumors grew that some 30 to 40 million would come       to New Delhi etc. The radical Hindu Sangh Parivar includes the Rahtriya Swayamsevak       Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). It accuses Christians       of forcible conversion or corrupt financial inducement (without       evidence). These charges are emphatically denied by Christian       leaders. Yet the Sangh Parivar is happy to coerce Dalits to remain       Hindu or to “reconvert”, and to “convert” tribals to       Hinduism. In fact, donations to Christian missions in India provide       India with less foreign exchange than it obtains from gurus       “converting” westerners to (Hindu) Transcendental Meditation and       so on. The threat of an avalanche of Dalits defections undermining their       privileged status galvanized the radical Hindus to a frantic effort       to cancel the event. A week before the rally, the VHP claimed a       conversion “conspiracy” by western Christian organizations under       the guise of a Buddhist event. They presented as evidence printouts       of those sensationalistic websites and emails, with reports of       truckloads of Christian literature. The Sangh Parivar (including RSS and VHP) pressured the BJP       government’s Home Minister Advani and the Delhi police to cancel       the rally. They attacked Ram Raj’s integrity as Deputy Tax       Commissioner for being on leave for four years, demanding that       Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha investigate. (Reports indicate Ram       Raj was busy establishing AICSSO, organizing its effective ’97, 98       and ‘99 rallies, organizing this 1 million “quit Hinduism”       campaign, and working on a PhD.) Claiming a Christian conspiracy, VHP President Girraj Kishore,       called for a ban on conversions of Dalit-Bahujans. After strong       condemnation, Kishore and Sangh Parivar activist Rajendra Chaddha       back tracked, claiming they were not concerned over Dalits becoming       Buddhists, but vehemently objected to their becoming Christians.       (Hindus claim Buddha as the 9th Avitar of Vishnu and       incorporate all Buddhists into Hinduism.) Ram Raj explicitly rebutted the VHP accusations. He emphasized that       he was not connected to any Christian groups. He rebutted the       “misinformation” of western websites and emails. He claimed       this was a Buddhist “re-affirmation” event with no       “conversions” (as Buddhism was an indigenous Indian religion.)       To salvage the rally and keep his core constituency, Ram Raj said       publicly that Dr. Pudaite would not be speaking and refused to let       any Christian literature be distributed. In 1992, the VHP destroyed the Babri mosque at Ayodhya. Some 3,000       Moslems were killed in the ensuing riots. Destruction of churches       and attacks on Christians under recent Indian governments have been       200 times greater than in the ‘60s and ‘70s. In 1999 radical       Hindus burned to death Australian missionary Graham Staines and his       two sons. On it’s website, the VHP called for “volunteers” to come and       disrupt the Dalit rally (private sources suggest 20,000). Citing       this, Ram Raj called on the Government to uphold the       Constitution’s freedom of religion, and protect rally       participants. This perceived threat of violence by radical Hindus was so great       that the Hindi press reported that the Dalai Lama called for the       rally to be stopped to prevent nation wide violence. (This for a       peaceful Buddhist rally that would have substantially boosted the 8       million Buddhists in India.) The National Minorities Commission also       called for the rally to be stopped, breaching its mandate to uphold       the constitutional rights of minorities. Just three days before the rally, R.S. Krishnaia, District       Commissioner of Police, revoked the rally permit granted to the       AIOCC. He claimed that “Material downloaded from the internet       clearly indicates that there is an organized attempt to use this       rally for mass scale of conversion.” This explicitly violated       India’s constitutional guarantees of the freedom to profess,       practice and propagate religion. India’s constitution requires the       Government to protect minorities’ rights, not help coerce them to       majority beliefs (i.e. fascism). Krishnaia also cited newspaper reports that 1 million would be       coming. He claimed this would exceed the capacity of the site and       threaten public safety, and that it was far above their application.       AICSSO had only registered for a “Buddhist” rally of 100,000,       not a “quit Hinduism” rally for the capacity of Ram Lila       grounds. (Time Magazine reported a “capacity” crowd of 275,000       for President Eisenhower.) However, AICSSO claims rallies of 500,000       and 800,000 to 1 million in Delhi in 1998 and 1999. Ram Raj fought back against this dictatorial Government action. He       urgently appealed to President K. R. Narayanan to intervene and       uphold democracy and the constitutional freedom of religion. He       confirmed that the rally was a Buddhist diksha ceremony and no       Christian conversions would take place. Foreign dignitaries were       invited and thousands of Dalits were already in Delhi. He said it       was too late to stop the rally at this 11th hour. Meanwhile the police dismantled the stage and positioned armed       forces to keep the Dalits out of the Ram Lila grounds. Banners were       posted declaring the event cancelled. Police imposed a de facto       state of emergency in the surrounding states, turning back massive       numbers of Dalits traveling to Delhi by bus and train. The AICSSO       claims that police kept 350,000 from reaching Delhi by force and       with reports that the rally was canceled. Dalits were barricaded into the Ambedkar Bhawan. Recommitting to       peaceful action, AICSSO leaders said: “If as the police fear,       violence breaks out, it will be the responsibility of the       government,” and: “If the police shoot, we will take the       bullets.” Denied the Ram Lila grounds, the AICSSO used the grounds       at Ambedkar Bhawan. Bhante Buddha Priya Rahul performed the sangha-diksha ceremony       (initiation into sangha. After Ram Raj was ceremonially shaved       (“tonsured”), he led those seeking Buddhist diksha to repudiate       Hinduism, and to take the 22 vows Dr. Ambedkar used in 1956. Ram Raj       then took a new Buddhist name Udit Raj. The AICSSO refused to let the radical Hindus separate them from       India’s Christians. The Buddhist rally honored and thanked senior       Christian leaders for their solidarity. Dr. Joseph D’Souza,       President, All India Christian Council, reaffirmed the Christian       community’s love for their oppressed brothers and sisters and       commitment to Dalit emancipation. Executive member Dr. K.P. Yohanan       welcomed them and committed on behalf of Gospel for Asia to bring       the light of education to the Dalits. Council Secretary General Dr.       John Dayal declared the rally a historic event that would shape       India’s future. The Dalits then moved on mass towards the Ram Lila grounds till       stopped at gunpoint by barricaded police. The tense confrontation       focused attention on the Dalits’ cause. After impassioned speeches       appealing for their constitutional rights, they finally dispersed.       Brahmin media downplayed these events claiming attendance of only       2-3000. Other observers reported that despite Government efforts       many Dalits reached the rally: cumulatively 50,000 (Times of India),       60,000 (BBC) or 100,000 (ESPL, 2 TV stations). On August 15, 2001 Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke out       against conversion: “There is a conversion motive behind the       welfare activities being carried out by some Christian missionaries       . . . and it is not proper.” He thus opposed the Constitution’s       guarantee of freedom of religion. Now his BJP Government sided with       the coercive efforts of the radical Hindus (their core       constituents). Ministers and officers actively prevented the public       exercise of India’s constitutional freedoms of religion, assembly       and speech. Others committed misprision (failure of official duties)       of negligence to uphold the Constitution. Thus both Prime Minister       and Cabinet breached their Oath of Office. On Nov. 5th, Vishal Mangalwadi threw down the gauntlet,       launching “The Quest for Freedom and Dignity: Caste, Conversion       and Cultural Revolution” in New Delhi – a manifesto for the Dalit       conversion movement. (See http://www.vishalmangalwadi.com ). The single minded efforts of Udit Raj (formerly Ram Raj) and AICSSO       to pull off this rally and see the Dalits set free from the bondage       of caste are indicators of the pent up explosive feelings against       the upper castes. The BJP Government’s coercive dictatorial       actions and abuse of Constitution may lose it the Dalit-Bahujan       (“majority”) vote and the next election. These events, Udit       Raj’s promised efforts and Mangalwadi’s book may well launch a       major civil/religious rights movement among the 290 million Dalits       and thence into India’s Bahujan (“majority”) of over 500       million “Other Backward Classes”. Private surveys and projections show that these rates of change of       belief in India from Hinduism to Christianity, Buddhism and Islam       are larger than official Government statistics. (See Operation World       2001. Details are not advertised because of the sensitivities       involved). Large numbers officially “quitting Hinduism” and the       draconian efforts to prevent them is wildfire news. It will jolt       Dalit-Bahujans into realizing they need no longer be bound by caste.       This paradigm change will catalyze even faster rates of people       leaving Hinduism. The most significant news is not these spectacular       events and headline numbers. It is these hidden but far greater       rates of change. ","Crime - Police"

"Perfume peddlers using ether to knock people out and rob them-Was Fiction!  Now a copycat incident may have taken place!","2015-03-16 17:08:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/perfume/"," The author says he or she was approached in a public place, such as a mall or on the street, and offered the chance to sample some perfume fragrances.  The author declined, then later learned that robbers are using that method to disable people with a whiff of ether then robbing them while they are unconscious. "," This eRumor circulated on the Internet from the late 1990’s to 2008    with no documented cases of perfume crooks being reported. S everal different versions    said that these events had happened in various cities in the United    States. Medical experts (as well as the many people who were anesthetized in the    old days with ether) say one hit of ether is not enough to knock someone    out. Then in July, 2008, a woman was arrested in Houma, Louisiana and charged    with battery and unlawful solicitation in a scheme that sounded very much    like the eRumor. The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s office said that the 22-year old woman    approached a man in a parking lot outside a video store and asked if he    wanted to buy some perfume.  She then sprayed him with the stuff and    the victim said the fumes left him feeling light-headed and irritated his    skin and that he had to go to the emergency room for treatment.     Houma police then discovered that the same woman had approached an 18-year    old a month earlier with the same offer and had given him a whiff of the    alleged perfume.  He later returned to work and passed out.  He    was given tests at a hospital for symptoms including dizziness, shortness    of breath, and numbness in his extremities.  Officials never found    out what the woman had in the bottles but she was arrested by a state    trooper who spotted her after a police broadcast of the description of her    car.  There were three men in the car with her who said they sold    perfume in New Orleans all the time. There was also a report of a similar incident by Police in    Mobile, Alabama in 1999, although it was never proven that it was    perpetrated by a crook.  Officers said that 54 year old Bertha Johnson told them that she was knocked out and robbed by someone who had her sample a fragrance.     An article in the Mobile Register newspaper from November 11, 1999, quoted    Johnson as saying the woman claimed she was selling cologne.  After    one whiff, Johnson said she passed out and awoke to discover that she and    her car were no longer in the parking lot of the bank, she had a splitting    headache, and $800 was missing from her purse, including some money she    was depositing for her employer.  Johnson is having to battle    skeptics who believe she invented the story and took the money herself.     No evidence has been found to substantiate what she alleged.

"Beware of crooks who use a technique to get your ATM card-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:14","https://www.truthorfiction.com/lebaneseloop/"," There is more than one version of this being circulated. One is in narrative form from a person who said she was scammed at an ATM machine.  She was trying to use the machine, but got a message that it was out of order.  A woman nearby told her the same thing had happened to her and gave her instructions on how to solve the problem, which included keying in her PIN number a couple of times.  Her card was not returned and she figured it was stuck in the machine.  What had actually happened, however, was that a thief had placed what is called a “Lebanese Loop” into the machine, a plastic sleeve that temporarily disabled the machine and captured her card.  After the woman bystander took note of the card user’s PIN number, she later retrieved the card from the machine and used it to withdraw cash. Another version is in the form of a PowerPoint presentation with images from a hidden camera showing a crook in action at an ATM and using this methodology to steal a customer’s ATM card. "," This type of ATM card fraud is true although the term “Lebanese Loop” is not the most common way of referring to it. TruthOrFiction.com has found substantiation of this scam from Credit Union Executive Magazine, the television program “20-20,” and a law enforcement agency. The technique is to disable the ATM machine, trick a card user into entering a PIN number and in a way that can be either observed or detected, then the thieves retrieve the card and use it. The version of the eRumor circulating with the PowerPoint presentation documents an actual thief at work.  It was captured by a surveillance camera.  The ATM card used in the pictorial demonstration indicates that it is from the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago but another version of the PowerPoint presentation uses the logo of Barclay’s bank.  One of the original postings of the series was on an Italian website. It is only one of many scams involving ATM machines.  One of the more elaborate has involved crooks actually putting a fake front on ATM machines that looks like the real thing and collects card numbers and PIN numbers. Police warn that the most common problem at automated bank machines is crooks who either hover over users’ shoulders to get their PIN numbers or who are watching from afar with scopes and then look for an opportunity to steal the card.

Dee McCown wrote an open letter that claims Attorney General Eric Holder joined racial antagonists in politicizing the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. "," It’s true that K. Dee McCown, a former FBI agent, penned this “epic” letter to Holder. McCown worked as a special agent and supervisory agent for the FBI from 1997 to 2008. He focused on counterterrorism, counterintelligence, criminal programs and hostage rescue. He has since transitioned to the private sector. TruthorFiction.com tracked McCown down in Texas, and he confirmed authorship of the letter to Holder in an online message: I am in fact the author of the letter to Mr. Holder and stand behind every word. It is time that we collectively push back and speak truth to power. Thank you and God bless. McCown sent the open letter to Holder on December 28, 2014. It quickly went viral and appeared on websites, blogs and forwarded emails across the web. McCown is critical of the attorney general’s public response to the high-profile deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner in the letter: Following the Michael Brown case Grand Jury decision all (Mr. Holder) could muster was the following comment: “The Department of Justice is currently investigating not only the shooting but also the Ferguson police department in what is called a “patterns and practices” inquiry to determine if the police department has engaged in systematic racism.” So, let’s get this straight. At a decisive moment in history when our nation required a strong and unbiased voice from its’ senior law enforcement official, you Mr. Holder, made it your personal mission to join with other racial antagonist and politicize a tragic event, accusing a young white police officer of a racially motivated killing in what we now know was a justified self-defense shooting of a predatory felon. Your behavior is unbelievable. You sir, have sacrificed your integrity on the altar of political expediency. You, Mr. Holder, are the “coward” and hypocrite you so loudly denounce when speaking of broken race relations in America. Holder and McCown simultaneously worked at the Department of Justice at various times between 1997 and 2008. Holder served as deputy attorney general under President Clinton. He also briefly served as acting attorney general under President George W. Bush before John Ashcroft was confirmed. ","Crime - Police"
"Concerns over the distribution of donations collected for victims of September 11-Truth!","2015-03-16 17:08:10","https://www.truthorfiction.com/donations/"," The message says that more than one billion dollars has been collected for the victims of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., but that only a fraction of it has gotten to the families.  It also says that fifteen percent of the donations will be kept by the charities collecting them and that some have not distributed any money at all. "," (2/7/02) The Wall Street Journal says that the Red Cross is offering financial help to well-to-do New York residents as a part of trying to make sure that all of the funds collected for 9/11 victims are used. MSNBC has compiled a look at how the various funds are doing: … SEPTEMBER 11th Fund (United Way of NYC and The New York Community Trust: Raised $337 million, has distributed $63 million. … Twin Towers Fund (Mayor Giuliani’s fund): Raised $113 million, has distributed $47 million. … Robin Hood Relief Fund (Concert of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and others): Raised $48 million, has distributed $13 million. … Victim Compensation Fund of the U.S. Government: Money will go to the injured ad families of the deceased by early next year. … SAFE HORIZON: More than $30 has been distributed to families. … ASPCA Disaster Relief Fund: More than $1.3 million raised. More than 200 animals have been saved and 300 treated. ——————————————————————————————— (11/12/01) As of this date, according to the publication “The Chronicle of Philanthropy,” 1.1 billion dollars has been raised and $204 million has been distributed through 29 charities.  The Chronicle says some charities feel that distributing the funds effectively should wait until they know what the scope of the donations is going to be.  Others are involved in controversy over accountability and deciding on who should qualify for the funds and, if so, how much. The eRumor says that a billion dollars is going to be divided by 6,000 victims, or about $167,000 per family.  In reality, the money is going to be spread more broadly.  The funds are not only for those who lost someone in death.  The Chronicle has surveyed some of the organizations and intended destinations of funds.  They include: …Support for immediate family members of firefighters, police officers, and emergency workers who died. …Help for recovery workers with financial or counseling need. …Help for families who are without income because of unemployment that resulted from the attacks. …Help for those who were injured. …Help for funeral and memorial service travel expenses for those who lost family members. …Supplies for relief workers. …Help for charities that experienced losses. …Assistance for small businesses affected. …Help for poor people affected by the attacks. …Costs for treatment of respiratory ailments for those who do not have health insurance coverage. …Support of injured police officers. Regarding the percentages being used by the charities for collecting and processing the funds, that is common. The key is for the charities to keep those administrative costs low and to be able to demonstrate to their donors that the purposes for which the funds were donated were accomplished.
