"Rare Black Moon Could Be Ominous Sign-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-09-29 14:23:07","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rare-black-moon-ominous-sign/"," A rare “Black Moon” event was scheduled to grace skies in September and October, and some are speculating that it’s a sign of of the apocalypse. "," Rumors about “Black Moon” astronomical events in September and October are true — but internet hype surrounding the events probably won’t live up to expectations. First, we’ll provide a little background on what, exactly, you can expect see during a Black Moon event. For that, we’ll turn to Science Alert , which provides a nice explainer on the relatively new astronomical event: Some say a Black Moon occurs about once every 19 years, when the month of February skips a Full Moon. Others say it describes a month that skips a new moon – the first phase of the lunar cycle, when the Moon and the Sun have the same elliptical longitude. But the most common definition for a black moon is that it’s the second new moon in a calendar month, which means this Friday’s event is the second time in September that the Moon will be entirely invisible in the night sky – for those in the Western Hemisphere, at least. If you’re familiar with your lunar cycles, you’ll know that a full moon occurs when the Earth-facing side of the Moon is completely illuminated by the Sun, thanks to its orbital position at a certain time of the month. Space.com explains that there’s usually one full moon and one new moon each month, but sometimes the lunar cycle doesn’t align there’s multiple of each in the same month, or none of each: From the Western Hemisphere, the new moon occurring on Friday, Sept. 30, is a Black Moon. Officially, it occurs at 8:11 p.m. Eastern Time (5:11 p.m. Pacific Time). For the Eastern Hemisphere (Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia), this new moon occurs after midnight on the calendar date of Oct. 1. So for this part of the world, this particular new moon is not the second one in the calendar month, but rather, the first! So it does not qualify as a Black Moon, and that hemisphere will have to wait until the end of the month for theirs. Indeed, for the billions living in the Eastern Hemisphere, the Black Moon will arrive on Oct. 30 or, if you live in eastern Asia, Japan, Australia or New Zealand, not until Oct. 31 (Halloween). The Black Moon is a somewhat unusual celestial event — they occur about once every 32 months. And, while a Black Moon is somewhat unusual in terms of lunar cycles, the moon won’t actually look different from the earth, just like a Blue Moon doesn’t actually appear blue, Smithsonian magazine reports : The best example for a similar kind of lunar phase “branding” might be the “blue moon,” which is supposedly the black moon’s opposite. Like the black moon, the term describes a second new moon in a month, a blue moon is when a second full moon appears in the sky. But the association only goes back to the 1940s, Rao reports. The meaning comes from a misinterpretation of an arcane rule found in the now-defunct Maine Farmer’s Almanac by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 article for Sky & Telescope. However, the term got picked up in the 1980s by a radio show and quickly became popularized. It’s unclear whether or not “black moon” will become as widely-known as blue moon, especially given that there isn’t much for viewers to take in. In any case, if you clouds move in Friday, don’t worry—you wouldn’t have seen the moon anyway. Simply put: don’t expect the moon to look any different during the Black Moon. And whenever there’s a rare or somewhat rare astronomical event, there seems to be some kind of conspiracy theory or warning about the end of days attached to it. The Black Moon is no different. There are rumors circulating social media that the Black Moon’s timing — less than a month after a “ Ring of Fire ” solar eclipse appeared over Africa — could be especially bad news for citizens of earth. The belief is that the two astronomical events align with biblical prophecy outlined in Luke 21:25-26 : 25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 26 People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. We can’t speak to the conspiracy theory about the Black Moon triggering the apocalypse, but we can confirm that it’s a somewhat underwhelming astronomical event that will occur in September and of October 2016.

"Meteor to Hit Puerto Rico in August 2016, Tsunami Expected-Fiction!","2016-08-16 14:20:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/meteor-hit-puerto-rico-august-2016-tsunami-expected/"," A meteor will strike off the coast of Puerto Rico in August 2016, sending a tsunami toward America’s Gulf Coast. "," There’s no truth to claims that an asteroid will hit Puerto Rico in August 2016. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which mans NASA’s asteroid surveillance program, did report any unusual meteor or asteroid activity in August or September 2016. The closest approach, listed in the chart below, was an asteroid expected to pass 3.3 million miles from Earth on August 25th: A full list of asteroid flybys through early October 2016 can be viewed here . Again, the list doesn’t show anything out of the ordinary. Earliest references to a meteor striking off the coast of Puerto Rico appeared to come in March 2014 in a YouTube video posted at channel operated by USA Times, a self-described “UFO channel.” The video warns that the meteor’s impact will trigger a tsunami that devastates America’s Gulf Coast and effectively initiates the Rapture. Those doomsday prophecies are similar to another end-times prediction for September 2015 that didn’t come true. In that version, which didn’t give a specific location for the meteor strike, doomsday predictors also claimed that an asteroid would strike Earth, “destroy” civilization and bring about the Rapture. That prophecy obviously didn’t come true — but it generated enough panic that NASA responded directly with a statement , “The Probability of Collisions with Earth,” that found the probability to be quite low: NASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small. In fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. To be able to better calculate the statistics, astronomers need to detect as many of the near-Earth objects as possible. It’s likely that we could identify a threatening near-Earth object large enough to potentially cause catastrophic changes in the Earth’s environment, and most astronomers believe that a systematic approach to studying asteroids and comets that pass close to the Earth makes good sense. It’s too late for the dinosaurs, but today astonomers are conducting ever-increasing searches to identify all of the larger objects which pose an impact danger to Earth. So, like previous false alarms about meteors and asteroids destroying the planet, this one has not merit. ","Space - Aviation"
"NASA Warns Nibiru or Planet X is Headed Straight for Earth-Fiction!","2016-07-05 13:14:09","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nasa-warns-nibiru-planet-x-headed-straight-earth/"," NASA has warned that a hulking planet known as Nibiru or Planet X is headed straight for the Earth and that a collision would have catastrophic consequences. "," NASA hasn’t issued any warnings about Nibiru or Planet X hurtling toward Earth. That rumor started with News 4 KTLA , a fake news website that is mocked up to look like a local TV news station but publishes fake, reader-submitted reports. The story, which appeared under the headline , “NASA Warns Disaster is Near: Nibiru is Headed Straight for Earth,” begins: Is this the end of the world as we know it? Doomsayers have prophesied for decades about a giant, rogue planet in our solar system – dubbed Planet X or Nibiru – that has the capacity of colliding or passing near Earth, with catastrophic consequences. And of course, NASA has known about the mystery planet for years, but declined to warn us…. until now.  Finally, after the announcement of “Planet Nine” in January, conspiracy theorists have proved to the skeptics that they have been right this entire time, and NASA finally has to admit its wrongs. The planet, according to Caltech researchers, has a mass about 10 times that of Earth and takes about 15,000 years to make a full orbit around the sun – And it’s heading towards Earth, with a collision date of August 21, 2016. Although Caltech researchers have admitted that we are headed for doomsday. NASA continues to tiptoe around the subject. Just like other stories published by News 4 KTLA like this one about millions of pounds of rat meat being sold as chicken wings, there’s no truth at all to this report. Nibiru, aka Planet X and Planet 9, has caused lots of doomsday prophecies and concerns about the imminent end of the Earth. We previously investigated a doomsday rumor related to Planet X and ruled that the existence of Planet X has never been proven — and that there was no imminent threat to Earth. Click here to read about that investigation. David Morrison, a NASA senior space scientist, posted a video in 2012 to further dispel rumors about the existence of Nibiru or Planet X, and the threat that it supposedly poses to Earth. Morrison said: There is no credible evidence whatever about the existence of Nibiru. There are no pictures, there’s no tracking, there’s no astronomical observations … I can quite specifically say how we know that Nibiru or Planet X does not exist and does not threaten the Earth. First, if there were a planet headed in to the inner solar system that was going to come close the Earth by December 2012, it would already be by Mars. It would be bright, clearly visible to the naked eye. If it were up there, you could see it. All of us could see it … Second, if Nibiru were real and it were a plaent of substantial mass it would already be perturbing the orbits of Mars and Earth. We would be changes in those orbits due to this rogue object coming into the solar system. Astronomers monitor the orbits of Earth and Mars precisely and frequently, and there has been no change whatever…. So, reports that Nibiru or Planet X exists and/or poses a threat to the Earth are both fiction. ","Space - Aviation"
"Strawberry Moon Can Be Seen During Summer Solstice-Truth!","2016-06-21 09:44:35","https://www.truthorfiction.com/strawberry-moon-can-seen-summer-solstice/"," The Summer Solstice brings a rare astronomical phenomenon called the “strawberry moon” this year. "," It’s true that the Summer Solstice will coincidentally coincide with the strawberry moon this year — but the strawberry moon doesn’t get its name from its color. The “strawberry moon” is a folk term used to describe June’s full moon because that astrological event has been long said to mark the height of the strawberry growing season. The Farmer’s Almanac explains : – Full Strawberry Moon – June This name was universal to every Algonquin tribe. However, in Europe they called it the Rose Moon. Also because the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries comes each year during the month of June . . . so the full Moon that occurs during that month was christened for the strawberry! Bob Mernan, an astronomer at the Farmer’s Almanac, told the Daily Telegraph that the strawberry moon offers appears in a light amber hue because of its position in the sky relative to the sun: “The sun gets super high so this moon must be super-low. This forces its light through thicker air, which also tends to be humid this time of year, and the combination typically makes (the moon) amber coloured.” In 2016, the strawberry moon happened to fall on the Summer Solstice — June 23rd — for the first time since 1967, which helped it gain a little extra attention. Astronomers say that’s a “twice in a lifetime” occurrence. ","Space - Aviation"
"Picture of the Andromeda Galaxy Next to the Moon-Fiction!","2016-05-25 16:17:18","https://www.truthorfiction.com/picture-andromeda-galaxy-next-moon/"," A picture that was supposedly taken without a telescope that shows the Andromeda Galaxy next to the moon has gone viral. "," This photo shows how the Andromeda Galaxy would look in the night sky if it were brighter — but it’s not an actual picture taken without a telescope. In reality, you can actually see (and probably photograph) the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye, but it looks nothing like the brightly colored galaxy in the picture. Andromeda Galaxy is roughly 2 million miles away from Earth, and it’s the most distant object that you can see in the night sky with the naked eye. However, it appears as a “dim, fuzzy star” with the naked eye. With binoculars, the elliptical shape of the galaxy can be made out, according to UCLA page that describe astronomical objects that can be seen from Los Angeles . The image that has been making the rounds online has clearly been doctored. This NASA image of the Andromeda Galaxy was overlaid on this image of a night sky that was posted on Flickr by an amateur photographer. However, there’s a catch. The doctored image shows what the Andromeda Galaxy could look like in the night sky if were brighter. Phil Plait, an astronomy writer for Slate , described the relevance of the image back in January 2014: The picture shows the crescent Moon in the sky, and superposed near it is the Andromeda galaxy, the nearest big spiral to our own Milky Way. The caption varies from site to site, but generally says that this is how big the Andromeda galaxy would actually look in our sky if it were brighter. Here’s the picture: And I have to say, that looks about right to me! Andromeda is one of the very few galaxies you can see with your naked eye from a dark site. It’s easy in binoculars, and if you use a small telescope, the galaxy fills the eyepiece. However, that’s just the core, the nucleus, of Andromeda. Like the Milky Way, Andromeda has vast spiral arms that extend well out from the core. From Earth, the galaxy appears to be more than 3 degrees across — remember, there are 90 degrees in a right angle, and 360 degrees in a circle; astronomers use angular size as a way to measure how big an object is on the sky. The Moon is about 0.5 degrees across (about half the width of your thumb held at arm’s length), so Andromeda is about six times bigger—roughly what’s shown in the picture. It may not be exact, but I don’t think it’s that important that it be perfect. It’s close enough, and certainly is an amazing thing to consider. So, the image of Andromeda Galaxy next to the moon was likely created to provide scale and perspective for how large the galaxy would appear in the night sky from 2.5 million light years away if it burned brighter. This image does not actually show Andromeda Galaxy next to the moon in the night sky — but it does have at least some scientific relevance.

"Saturn Will Be Closest to Earth in May than Ever Before-Fiction!","2016-04-27 13:41:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/saturn-will-closest-earth-may-ever/"," A meme making the rounds on social media claims that Saturn will be closer than ever before to Earth on May 1, 2016, and it will fill much of the sky. "," There’s no truth to reports that Saturn will be closer to Earth than ever before in May 2016, or that it’ll appear so large that it covers most of the sky. Those rumors started with meme making the rounds on social media. It’s not clear where the meme originated, but it’s fairly easy to disprove. The first claim, that Saturn will be the closest it has ever been to Earth on May 1, 2016, doesn’t check out. The distance between Saturn and the Earth constantly changes as both planets travel through space. At its closest, Saturn is 746 million miles from Earth, and at its farthest (when on the opposite sides of the sun), Earth and Saturn are about a billion miles apart, Space.com reports . And, just under once a year, Earth overtakes Saturn’s rotation, which causes Saturn to appear to move backwards up the night sky. This is referred to as “Saturn in Opposition,” and it was taking place in spring 2016 when this rumor went viral, EarthSky reports : When can I see Saturn in 2016? In late March and early April, you have to stay up late or wake up before dawn to see Saturn. From mid-northern latitudes, in late March 2016, it’s rising around midnight local time – that’s midway between sunset and sunrise. South of the equator, Saturn can be seen earlier. Stay up late or get up early on the mornings of March 28, 29 and 30 to see the waning moon near Saturn, as shown on the sky chart above. Saturn will rise about two hours earlier for each month that follows this one. By late April 2016, Saturn will climb into our sky by around mid-evening, and by late May – as seen from around the world – you’ll see Saturn coming up at nightfall or early evening. June and July will be especially good months in 2016 to view Saturn. The planet will be out all night long, or nearly so. The reason is that we’ll pass between Saturn and the sun on June 3. At that time, Saturn will be opposite the sun as seen from Earth, to rise in the east at sunset, climb highest up at midnight and to set in the west at sunrise. It’s true that you’ll be able to see Saturn in the night sky without a telescope during this time. It appears as a steady light with a golden color. However, in order to see Saturn’s rings you would need to use a telescope. Given all that, we’re calling this one “fiction.” ","Space - Aviation"

"," Don’t believe Armageddon warnings about Planet 9 or Planet X ushering in Armageddon in the coming months. These warnings seem to have started as a tongue-and-cheek in a video posted by the New York Post . The 30-second video talks about the discovery of Planet 9 (also known as Planet X) and casually mentions “some believe” that it could send asteroids and comets toward Earth, causing mass extinction, by the end of April. However, the video isn’t a doomsday warning — it’s a poorly executed joke about how Armageddon won’t stop the IRS from collecting taxes. The video’s subtitles read: “When closest to us, (Planet 9) pushes asteroids and comets toward Earth. Some scientists believe this is what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. They also believe it’s going to happen again… as early as this month. So if you haven’t paid your taxes yet, you should hurry up and do them because the IRS will still find you even if the world ends. And there has long been talk about a Planet 9 on the outer edge of the solar system. It’s supposedly 10 times the size of Earth and orbits the sun about 600 times farther away — but it’s never actually been discovered, Space.com reports : …Astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown, both of whom are based at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, inferred the planet’s existence based on the strange orbits of a half dozen small objects in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Astronomers are now actively hunting for Planet Nine — which Batygin and Brown think is about 10 times more massive than Earth, and orbits about 600 times farther from the sun than our planet does — but to date, it has not been detected. After the Post’s video went viral, one of those astronomers, Mike Brown, even responded directly to claims that Planet 9 could bring Armageddon before the end of April: So, reports about Planet 9 or Planet X causing a doomsday scenario for Earth are false.

"Green Moon Will Be Seen in May 2016-Fiction!","2016-03-29 08:04:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/green-moon-will-seen-may-2016/"," A viral Facebook post claims that an extremely rare astronomical event called a “green moon” will make the moon appear green for the first time since the 1800s. "," There’s no truth to reports that a “green moon” astronomical event will happen for the first time since 1847 in May 2016. The rumor started with a meme on Facebook that showed an image of a green moon and text that read, “Save the Date – May 29th, 1016. Green Moon Visible for First Time Since 1847”: There are three main reasons we’re calling the green moon claim “fiction.” First, there are plenty of credible websites that list astronomical events for 2016, and a green moon doesn’t appear on any of them. Space.com , Sea and Sky and Universe Today have comprehensive lists, including “The Top 101 Astronomical Events for 2016,” and the so-called green moon is nowhere to be found. Second, the photo of the green moon used in the meme appears to have been lifted from a flickr account . The user had photoshopped a photo of the moon taken on August 3, 2009, and posted a joking comment, “Who said the moon isn’t made of green cheese.” Third, there were some cool astronomical events in 1847 — including a solar eclipse — but there’s no record of a green moon occurring that year. And, considering that Neptune had just been discovered the year before , there was plenty of interest in astronomy back then, so it wouldn’t have gone unnoticed. Finally, there was an actual astronomical event that may have inspired the green moon in May claim that apparently started as that joke and snowballed into a hoax. In March 2016, at the same time that the green moon rumor went viral, astronomers and stargazers were on the lookout for a green comet, LINEAR, Tech Times reports : Kelly Beatty, senior editor of the space magazine Sky & Telescope,explained that Comet LINEAR may not appear quite as obvious as typical depictions of comets that have long tails. She said that the light of this particular comet is not concentrated in one point, but rather it is spread out. This gives it a soft, round glow that is larger than that of the Moon though several times dimmer. The green haze typically seen surrounding LINEAR is believed to be produced when light from the sun comes into contact with the comet’s diatomic carbon atoms. So, although we can’t confirm this, it seems probable that the green LINEAR comet expected in late March 2016 may have inspired claims about a green moon appearing in May 2016. For all these reasons, we’re calling this one fiction. ","Space - Aviation"

In November 2015, a web comic called “The Oatmeal” rekindled the legendary account of how Gene Roddenberry survived on a plane crash on June 18, 1947, when an engine on a Pan Am flight from Calcutta to New York caught fire. In a series of animated story boards, the comic strip recounts how Roddenberry, a member of the flight crew, helped calm passengers before the plane crashed into the Syrian dessert. Fourteen passengers were killed on impact, and, with a pair of broken ribs, Roddenberry continuously went back into the flaming wreckage to pull passengers out, according to the comic strip’s narrative: And with a pair of broken ribs, he went back into the burning plane, pulling survivors from the wreckage. Eventually the wind turned and fire overtook the aircraft. And so they waited. Morning Arrived., but a rescue did not. The co-pilot took charge, and formed two search parties. The first party went in one direction, the second party, along with the co-pilot, went in the other, wandering into the dessert. The eventually found a village. A village which had a radio. That account of Gene Roddenberry surviving a plan crash checks out. Gene Roddenberry flew B- 17 bombers for the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his service. Then, after the war, he joined Pan American World Airways and survived the plane crash on June 18, 1947, according to Gene Roddenberry’s official biography : At war’s end, he joined Pan American World Airways. It was on a flight from Calcutta that his plane lost two engines and caught fire in flight, crashing at night in the Syrian desert. As the senior surviving officer, Roddenberry sent two Englishmen swimming across the Euphrates River in quest of the source of a light he had observed just prior to the crash impact. The Englishmen reached a Syrian military outpost, which sent a small plane to investigate. Roddenberry returned with the small plane to the outpost, where he broadcast a message that was relayed to Pan Am, which sent a stretcher plane to the rescue. Roddenberry later received a Civil Aeronautics commendation for his efforts during and after the crash. After Gene Roddenberry left aviation to pursue a career in television, he had a stop-off as a Los Angeles police officer before he found success. Then, in 1966, Roddenberry created and produced Star Trek, which went on to develop one of the most loyal fan bases in the history of television. So, accounts of a young Gene Roddenberry surviving a plan crash before going on to create and produce Star Trek are true. ","Space - Aviation"

The post appeared under the headline, “Top Scientists Issue HUGE ALERT: Everything In Place to Open Gates of Hell This Year- — 2015.” The post (falsely) warns that CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could cause “3 distinctive life extinction events,” including the creation of “baby black holes.” Before It’s News isn’t a credible news source. The website’s stories are submitted by “a community of individuals who report on what’s going on around them.” That leads to a lot of false reports, like the one about a ship that reappeared 90 years after it went missing in the Bermuda Triangle. The fake “warnings” about CERN’s destructive capabilities were taken from safety information posted on CERN’s website about the LHC that covers cosmic rays, microscopic black holes, strangelets and vacuum bubbles. These fake warnings sparked additional false warnings like this YouTube video that had more than 580,000 views: And, in case you’re wondering, microscopic black holes have never resulted from LHC particle collisions, CERN reports : Another way of revealing extra dimensions would be through the production of “microscopic black holes”. What exactly we would detect would depend on the number of extra dimensions, the mass of the black hole, the size of the dimensions and the energy at which the black hole occurs. If micro black holes do appear in the collisions created by the LHC, they would disintegrate rapidly, in around 10-27 seconds. They would decay into Standard Model or supersymmetric particles, creating events containing an exceptional number of tracks in our detectors, which we would easily spot. Finding more on any of these subjects would open the door to yet unknown possibilities. So, there’s no truth to the reports that CERN plans to blast a hole into the earth, or take part in any other “life extinction events.” ","Space - Aviation"

"," The claim that a massive asteroid will hit the earth in September 2015 is a hoax. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) operates the Near-Earth Object Program to identify asteroids that come within millions of miles of earth. The JPL has taken to Twitter to dismiss claims that a massive asteroid will strike earth in September 2015: “ The September asteroid scare is just another hoax.” “The claims an asteroid scheduled to hit earth in September are a hoax.” “There is no such object posing a threat to Earth. There are several hoaxes, akin to the doomsday 2012 hoax, circulating the web.” These claims appear to have started with the Rev. Efrain Rodriguez, a Pentecostal Evangelical minister from Puerto Rico. Rodriguez claimed that god told him an asteroid would strike off the coast of Puerto Rico and cause 40 million deaths. Aside from Rodriguez’s personal account, there’s no proof that an asteroid is on course to strike earth in September 2015. These claims were echoed by a number of blog sites and went viral with a YouTube video that had more than 430,000 views. But the video appears to be nothing more than an advertisement for a book about the rapture and doesn’t include any details about the so-called asteroid bound for Earth. Because there is no scientific proof that an asteroid will hit the Earth in September 2015, and because NASA has directly denied those claims, we’re classifying this one as fiction.

"NASA Received an Alien Distress Call-Fiction!","2015-05-14 23:02:38","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nasa-received-an-alien-distress-call/"," NASA received a distress call from another galaxy in 1998. "," This hoax has been circulating the web for years. Weekly World News , a supermarket tabloid known for publishing fake news stories, first reported that NASA had received a distress call from another galaxy in September 1998. Although Weekly World News is most famous for publishing fictional stories about “Bat Boy,” conspiracy theories about the alien distress call story have persisted for years. The eRumor gained new life in 2011 when it was reported that NASA had finally decoded the message, 13 years after it was received. A YouTube video that makes that claim has more than 4 million views: “Russian Chief of General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces Victor Kulakov revealed that in 1998 NASA’s radio telescopes received a message from space … a signal transmitted from the galaxy Andromeda. Thirteen years later (in 2011) NASA decoded a message included in this signal and discovered a dramatic call for help from an extraterrestrial civilization…” The video acknowledges that Weekly World News first reported the story back in 1998, but it defends the original source by giving examples of times when supermarket tabloids were the first to report breaking news stories that turned out to be true. But that doesn’t make sense in this case. The original story claims that NASA received and decoded the distress signal from space in 1998. The newer version claims that NASA was only able to decode the distress signal in 2011. The video defends the original story as true, and then it directly contradicts it. In truth, astronomers have been listening for signals from alien civilizations since 1960. Today, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute leads the effort. But researchers say , “No convincing signals have been picked up.” ","Space - Aviation"
"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","2015-03-30 18:09:22","https://www.truthorfiction.com/germanwings-pilot-had-converted-to-islam/"," A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. "," There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there’s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings said in a statement that the crash “appeared” to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: “We are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to have been crashed deliberately – probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like this could occur within our company.” It’s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide. French authorities found a torn up sick note from a doctor that would have excused Andreas Lubitz from work on the day of the crash, but the reason for the note hasn’t been revealed. Germanwings said that Lubitz didn’t submit the sick note to them. German officials said that Andreas Lubitz had hid “an unspecified medical condition” from his employers, the Telegraph reports : “The fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional colleagues. “The prosecutors said in a statement that the documents were found in searches of Lubitz’s homes in Duesseldorf and in the town of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. “The Uniklinik hospital in Dusseldorf confirmed that it had treated Lubitz in recent weeks but said it was not for depression. “Meanwhile Bild, the German newspaper, reported that ‘Lubitz had a serious relationship crisis with his girlfriend before the disaster and the resulting heartbreak is thought to have led to this.’” Just before the crash, Andreas Lubitz’s pregnant girlfriend broke up with him. Her friends said Lubitz was a “tormented and erratic man” who suffered from unpredictable behavior and mood swings. He had also been having an affair with a Germanwings flight attendant in the months leading up to the crash, the Daily Mail reports . Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane. Sill, other theories claim that it was an act of terrorism and that Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam. One of those claims comes from the German blog site Pi-News: “All evidence indicates that the copilot of Airbus machine in his six-months break during his training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and subsequently either by the order of ‘radical,’ ie. devout Muslim , or received the order from the book of terror, the Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of the investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that he — as Mohammed Atta, in the attack against New York — received his instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.” That report has been repeated by a number of blog sites across the web. However, Pi-News isn’t a trustworthy news source. The website describes itself as against “the mainstream, America, Israel, basic and human laws and the fight against the Islamisation of Europe.” Officials in France and Germany have not said that the crash could have been an act of terrorism, but the investigation is ongoing.

"," The story is true and is posted on an official U.S. Air Force web page on the Internet.  On August 16, 1960 Captain Joe Kittenger became the first man to freefall back to earth from an altitude of close to 20 miles. The environment was so harmful at 102,800 feet that Kittenger had to wear a pressurized suit with layers of insulation to keep him alive in temperatures as low as -94°F in the vacuum of space. At any elevation above 62,000 feet a man’s blood would literally boil because of the extremely low atmospheric pressure. Kittenger’s freefall descent lasted about 4 minutes and he reached a speed in excess of 600 miles an hour, faster than the speed of sound. At 18,000 feet he deployed his parachute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The total time of his voyage back to Earth was 13 minutes, 45 seconds. Kittenger continued his military career commanding the 555 Tactical Fighter Squadron and flying an F-4 Phantom Jet during the Viet Nam war. Shortly after shooting down an enemy MiG-21 aircraft Kittenger was shot down and captured on May 11, 1972. He was held at the “Hanoi Hilton” as a prisoner of war for 11 months.

Katherine Garcia, chief of media relations for the Thunderbirds says the picture is real but is not showing the planes accurately and that the comment in the message about the picture are fabricated. She says the picture was taken from a ground perspective that results in the planes appearing to almost collide but that in reality they were 500 feet apart. She says the bottom plane was actually going straight down and the top plane was gaining altitude. She adds that the Thunderbirds have procedures for calling a “knock-off” to the maneuver if any of them feels that they are too close for comfort and they simply go opposite directions from each other for sake of safety. A Thunderbird ground observer is on duty during each performance and can also call for a knock-off if anything looks amiss from the ground. Sgt. Garcia says the picture has been circulating on the Internet for quite a while but is, in reality, a snapshot from a normal Thunderbirds performance and that there was no danger. Last updated 2/15/04 This is the way the picture is shown with the eRumor. The planes appear to have gotten in each other’s way and are dangerously close to colliding. In reality, according to the Thunderbirds, the plane with the speed brakes deployed (those flap-looking devices on each side of the tail) was going toward the ground while the other was climbing. The plane going down is closer to the camera than the one going up. If we look closely, the wingtip of the climbing plane is behind the nose of the descending plane. If this were a video, we’d see the descending plane pass downward but in front of the plane behind it. ","Space - Aviation"
"Pictures of the sound barrier-Disputed!","2015-03-25 21:41:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/soundbarrier/"," This email features a picture of an F-18 jet fighter flying through a cloudy circle of what is said to be visible evidence of breaking the sound barrier.  The story says the photo was taken by Ensign John Gay when the plane swished past the U.S. aircraft carrier Constellation at 750 miles per hour. "," Ensign Gay is real and he did take the picture.  There is controversy among people who have seen the picture, however, as to whether it is authentic.  Some observers say that what Ensign Gay has photographed is not a breaking of the sound barrier, but a different phenomenon involving a combination of the aerodynamics of the airplane, the atmospheric pressure, and the temperature.  Also, Ensign Gay says he took the picture at the moment he heard the sonic boom.  Critics have said that is not likely since the plane was flying faster than sound, so any sonic boom would have been heard after the plane passed. To get a professional perspective on this, TruthOrFiction.com turned to Professor James R. Frysinger of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University/College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina and who served in the United States Navy.  He says such pictures can be authentic and explains why.  He also describes why the person taking a picture of a supersonic jet would indeed hear a sonic boom even if the jet had exceeded the sound barrier long before arriving at the photographer’s location: Dr. Frysinger wrote: The explanation A conically shaped high pressure surface is formed by objects traveling faster than the speed of sound in a medium, e.g., a jet flying through the air. This cone is caused by the sound source (jet) traveling faster than the sound waves that are produced by it can travel. The result is an “envelope” of overlapping circles (“sound wave crests”), each with its center lying ahead of the last sound crest. That envelope is conically shaped with its point at the actual sound source. Lying just inside this conically shaped sound pressure wave (above ambient pressure) is a similar, conically shaped surface of below-ambient pressure air (“sound wave trough”). This is a necessary result of the wave nature of sound waves. Any decent physics text will have a sketch of this. If the humidity level is high enough (e.g., just above sea surface on a warm Pacific Ocean afternoon), the humidity in the air may condense in that trough of low pressure and form a cloud, only to be reabsorbed by the air when pressure returns to normal. Such clouds tend to form on the noses, nacelles, an leading egdes or tips of wings, canards, etc. These are not unlike contrails except that the water vapor is present in the air before the jet passes, as opposed to being the result of burning jet fuel. The sonic “boom” Pictures of these show the result of moisture condensing in the conically shaped wave trough just behind the shock wave. The sonic “boom” reported with these events is NOT caused at the time the jet’s speed rises past the speed of sound. It is in fact the continuous sound that the shock wave “crest” represents. A person farther down the path of the jet will hear the same “boom” but later than a person nearer the jet’s direction of approach. The speed of the sound crest is equal to the speed of the jet in the direction of travel and equal to the speed of sound perpendicular to the cone’s surface. The movie clip on my website at www.cofc.edu/~frysingj/fs14ss.mpg shows the jet approaching and at that moment it has not yet been heard by the observer. Many of the stills being passed around are single frames from similar video clips; the camera was rolling before the “boom” was heard. A personal account I was fortunate during my last tour of duty to be standing atop a building at the end of the main runway at NOB Norfolk, a large naval base during a show by the Navy Blue Angels. My height above ground was equivalent to being on the fourth floor, but I was on top of it and “in the elements”. The announcer let us know that a jet was coming in at a supersonic speed and would pass at that speed down the length of the runway and “very close to the deck”. I saw it coming and aimed my camera slightly downward to its altitude and then tripped the shutter on my tripod-mounted camera as it went by. Immediately, I was blown over backwards and my camera and its tripod landed on top of me. The sequence–all in a fraction of a second–was click, boom, thud. Having been alerted I didn’t need to “wait for the boom” to tell when to take the picture. And since the shock wave is NOT a momentary phenomenon, I could let my eye judge when he would be “dead ahead”. All this happened so fast that it seemed for a moment to be simultaneous, but that was an illusion. Yes, I got the picture, looking slightly down into the cockpit and with a clear view of the pilot. Humidity levels that day were too low for a contrail-type cloud to form as they did in the movie clip cited above. The technical explanation The geometry works out such that the sine of the apex half-angle (half the angle at the point of the cone) is equal to the ratio of the speed of sound in air of that temperature, pressure, and humidity to the jet’s speed. That speed ratio is called the Mach Number. So, sin(theta) = V/v or sin(theta) = 1/(Mach Number) where v is the speed of the jet, V is the speed of sound at that location, and theta is half the angle made at the point of the cone. Notice that if the speed of the jet equals the speed of sound, the “cone” is actually a flat surface perpendicular to the direction oftravel. If the jet’s speed is less than the speed of sound, theequation is not valid; there IS no superposition of crests taking place(although there is a large pressure build up, similar to a bow wave ona ship).

"," Lt. Commander Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare is the subject of many articles that document his outstanding service as a pilot during World War II.  He was presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions against the Japanese and defending the U.S.S. Lexington.  According to the official citation of his Medal of Honor , he won the recognition “For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat…”  It says he was the section leader of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942.  According to an article on aviation-history.com , six Wildcats were sent into the air to protect the Lexington from Japanese bombers.  O’Hare and his wingman spotted the enemy planes first.  The wingman’s guns jammed, however, and the other four planes were too far away, so O’Hare faced 9 twin-engine Japanese bombers alone.  He shot down five of them and damaged a sixth before other U.S. fighters arrived.  No enemy bombs made it to the Lexington.  The Medal of Honor citation calls it “…one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation…”  O’Hare was killed in November of 1943 during the battle for the Gilbert Islands in the South Pacific.  He was accidentally shot down by another American plane during a night mission.  It is true that Chicago’s O’Hare airport is named after him and there is a restored airplane on display there similar to the one that O’Hare flew. Butch’s father, Eddie O’Hare, was an attorney and business partner of the famous gangster Al Capone.  He helped run Capone’s horse and dog track operation in Chicago.  He was described as being devoted to his son.  There was a point when Eddie decided to secretly become an informant for the Internal Revenue Service and it was with his help that the government convicted and imprisoned Capone for income tax evasion.  Some have said that Eddie became an informant because of a change of heart and a desire to go straight.  Others have said it was merely his way of saving his neck in the face of potential prosecution.  It was an article in Collier’s magazine in 1947 about Eddie O’Hare’s work as an informant that helped win public favor for him and the eventual naming of Chicago’s airport after his war-hero sun.   The article was written by Frank J. Wilson, the Treasury Department investigator with whom O’Hare had worked on the case.  The article was titled “Undercover man: he trapped Capone.”  Wilson called O’Hare one of his best undercover men.

"The Pentagon was not struck by a hijacked jet on September 11-Fiction!","2015-03-17 22:02:12","https://www.truthorfiction.com/pentagoncrash/"," The allegation  is that the destruction at the Pentagon on September 11 was not the result of being hit by a hijacked American Airlines 757, but some other cause.  The theories range from the building being hit by a remote-control U.S. fighter jet to being damaged by a truck bomb. "," There are numerous sites that promote the notion that the U.S. government is covering up the true cause of the Pentagon destruction on September 11, but the main one is from France at http://www.asile.org/citoyens/numero13/pentagone/erreurs_en.htm In large headline, it asks the reader to “Hunt the Boeing,” referring to the American Airlines Boeing 757 that plunged into the Pentagon. The site is a part of speculation by conspiracy theorists and includes a book published in France by Thierry Meyssan titled “The Frightening Fraud.”  In it, the author contends that flight #77 did not end by crashing into the Pentagon and that the whole thing is part of a government plot and cover-up.  Meyssan says it doesn’t make sense to him that there aren’t any airplane pieces left over from the crash and that the Pentagon did not immediately fall from the impact. The website asks several questions, which we will deal with in order. 1.  “The Associated Press first reported that a booby trapped truck had caused the explosion.” If this AP report was made, TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find it and none of the sites that makes reference to it lists a source.  Conflicting reports are common during breaking stories and if someone did speculate a truck bomb, that theory quickly disappeared. 2.  “Can you explain how a Boeing 757- 200, weighing nearly 100 tons and travelling at a minimum speed of 250 miles an hour only damaged the outside of the Pentagon? ” First, the Pentagon suffered extensive damage to more than just the outside. CLICK HERE TO SEE CHART Also, the portion of the Pentagon where the plane hit was probably the most heavily reinforced.  In the October 3, 2001 edition of Architecture Week, B.J. Novitski wrote that the impact of the plane was in “Wedge One,” which had been strengthened by recent renovation, a project that was inspired, in part, by the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He says that contrary to what is believed, the casualties among workers in the Pentagon were not low because of vacant offices, but because of the extraordinary structural strength of the building.  Novitski says that about 80 percent of the workers in the wedge were on duty that day, but …”the exterior walls had been reinforced with steel beams and columns, bolted where they met at each floor. Some of these reinforced walls very near the point of impact remained in place for a half hour before collapsing, allowing uncounted hundreds to escape.”  The hijackers chose one of the most reinforced buildings in the world to crash into. 3.  ‘Can you explain how a Boeing 14.9 yards high, 51.7 yards long, with a wingspan of 41.6 yards and a cockpit 3.8 yards high, could crash into just the ground floor of this building?’ Eyewitnesses to the crash as well as video from a security camera at the Pentagon show that the plane struck at ground level.  Considering the description of the strength of the building (above), it is not surprising that the weaker appendages of the plane such as the tail and the wings would not have had as much of an impact as the main body. 4.  “Can you explain why the Defence [sic] Secretary deemed it necessary to sand over the lawn, which was otherwise undamaged after the attack?” According to the article in Architecture Week, it was for a gravel bed that provided a road for large trucks to have access to the crash site. 5.  “Can you explain what happened to the wings of the aircraft and why they caused no damage?” Same answer as in #3.  Photographs show indentations where the stronger, inner portions of the wings may have made impact, but the farther out towards the tips of the wings and the tail, the less they would have had effect. 6.  “Can you find the aircraft’s point of impact? We’re not sure what this question is supposed to mean.  There are plenty of pictures that show clearly where the airplane hit the building.  For some reason, the creators of the website chose two of the pictures that don’t show it clearly.  Dick Bridges, the deputy manager for Arlington County was quoted by AP on September 14, 2001, as saying that both of the “black boxes” for flight #77 were found “…right where the plane came into the building.”  If the recorders didn’t get much beyond that, the plane not only struck the building at that point, but the ground as well.  The cockpit voice recorder was so badly damaged that it didn’t yield any information. Other considerations… 1.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77 that hit the Pentagon, then where is the airplane and the 64 people who were aboard? None of the conspiracy sites answers that question.  Few of them even ask it. 2.  If it was not American Airlines flight 77, then why do they have evidence of the bodies of known crew, passengers, and hijackers? C. Christopher Kelley of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology says that the effort to identify bodies that ended on November 16, 2001, identified all but one of the victims of flight 77. 3.  In response to the question of “Where is the Boeing,” the answer is “in pieces.” There was plenty of evidence of the airplane at the site including debris from the plane, as mentioned above, the remains of the passengers, and the cockpit data and voice recorders.  Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reported on September 13,2001,  that members of congress who had visited the Pentagon crash site were told by rescue officials that much of the fuselage of the Boeing 757 remained intact inside the damaged Pentagon. 4.  Radar tracked the plane toward the Pentagon. Much has been made on some of the conspiracy sites that the transponder in the cockpit was turned off by the hijackers so it isn’t clear what happened to the plane after that.  The founder of TruthOrFiction.com, Rich Buhler, is a licensed commercial pilot and says the transponder being turned off doesn’t mean the plane can no longer be seen on radar.  The transponder is a device that not only makes the airplane more visible on a radar screen, but also gives the radar controller other information such as the altitude, speed, and sometimes the identity of the airliner.  If the transponder is turned off, radar controllers can usually still see what is called the “primary target.”  That means there is a blip on the radar screen showing the location.  According to www.airdisaster.com , flight 77’s transponder was turned off shortly after departure from Dulles airport near Washington DC, but radar controllers could see the primary target flying directly toward the White House.  Then the plane was seen to veer away from the White House and head for the Pentagon.","Space - Aviation"

"Woman who preached to Alaska Airlines passengers on doomed flight-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:57:53","https://www.truthorfiction.com/alaskaflight261/"," The email being circulated says that a pastor’s wife on a doomed Alaska Airlines plane addressed the passengers for 9 minutes and led them in prayer before the plane crashed.  This allegedly came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings.  The original version of the eRumor said the pastor’s wife was from Idaho.  More recent versions say it was a pastor’s wife from Washington.  Further, the email states that the pilot says there was no explanation for why the plane was able to stay aloft for those final 9 minutes. "," There is no evidence this happened.  The National Transportation Safety Board has now released the cockpit voice recordings from the flight and there is nothing like this story on them. Alaska flight 261 crashed off the coast of California on January 31, 2000.  The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner carried 88 people.  There were no survivors. Among the passengers were Joe and Linda Knight from Monroe, Washington.  They were co-pastors of The Rock Church in Monroe.  Their adult son, who is also a minister, is quoted in news reports as saying Linda was the kind of person who would probably preach to the passengers during an emergency.  It is possible that’s where the story originated. When the eRumor first started, there were several things about it that didn’t seem valid. First, the claim that the information came from an Alaska pilot who heard the cockpit voice recordings was not credible.  The tapes were in the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board who keeps things like that very secure.  It would be illegal for anyone to release that kind of information before the NTSB does. Second, we talked with several pilots who fly the MD-80 and they all agreed that the cockpit voice recorder does not record what is said in the passenger cabin over the P.A. system.  It records the cockpit crew and radio conversations. Third, it is not credible that any passenger would have been able to spend 9 minutes talking over the P.A. system to fellow passengers.  According to published news reports, the first time the plane reported trouble to air traffic controllers was at 4:10pm.  The last transmission from the plane was at 4:17pm and it disappeared from radar at 4:21pm.  That meant there were about 11 minutes from the beginning of the emergency to the crash.  For Linda Knight to have addressed the passengers for 9 minutes, she would have been given the microphone within 2 minutes of when the crew first reported a problem.  If anything would have been communicated to the passengers during that time, it would have been from the crew and if they felt a crash was imminent, they would have been talking about emergency procedures, not letting a passenger address the other passengers. Finally, there is good explanation how the plane stayed in the air.  The pilots were able to struggle to stabilize the plane and had reported to controllers that they thought they could make it to Los Angeles International Airport.  It is believed that there was catastrophic failure that led to the plane’s final plunge into the ocean.  So this story felt, acted, and tasted like a rumor from the beginning.

Less than two hours after take off all contact with the plane.   Two passengers who were listed as being on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight turned up elsewhere and reported that their passports had been stolen. Responders in the air and on the sea have found an oil slick and some debris but these have not been connected with Flight MH370.   The plane is still missing and  conspiracy theories of a terrorist attack are flying on the World Wide Net. "," TruthOrFiction.Com is following this story and all allegations of foul play, terrorism or alien abduction.  We will post findings here as they develop.  So far, this remains a mystery. Update 03/24/14: Prime Minister Najib Razak said that Malaysia MH370 flight ended in Indian Ocean. The government in Malaysia said today that they have concluded that, “based on satellite data analysis from British company Inmarsat, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ended in the Indian Ocean, and no one on board survived.”  This according to a March 24, 2014 article by the U.K.’s Telegraph that said Prime Minister Najib Razak said that “Inmarsat engineers have been able to establish that the plane’s last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.”   Razak added, “This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.” Update 03/16/14: Investigators now believe that H370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan. According to a March 16, 2014 article by the Daily Mail in England, investigators now believe that the missing MH370 was hijacked and diverted to possibly reach Pakistan.  The article said, “A Malaysian government official said people with significant flying experience could have turned off the flight’s communication devices. The representative said that hijacking theory was now ‘conclusive’, and, as a result, police have raided the luxury homes of both the captain and the co-pilot.” The pilot and co-pilot of the the 777 Zahari Ahmad Shah (photo left) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (photo right) “are now being investigated as police in Kuala Lumpur search for signs of foul play.” Background Loss of contact and sudden course change Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off on March 8 at 12:21AM (local time) from Kuala Lumpur and was expected to land in Beijing approximately 6:30AM.  The jet had reached an altitude of 35,000 feet when contact was lost with the plane at approximately 2:40AM. According to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today , the Malaysian military radar indicated that Flight 370 made a sharp turn and “flew at least as far as the Malacca Strait west of Malaysia.”    The article said, “Malaysian authorities have said the plane’s electronic signaling transponder apparently stopped working at about the time civilian flight controllers lost contact with it, near the coast of Vietnam.”  Malaysian Air Force Air Force chief General Rodzali Daud told reporters that military radar data showed  “the track of the plane then turning sharply and eventually flying over the island of Pulau Perak — hundreds of miles off course.” Responders in the air and on the sea are busy conducting search and rescue for the missing airliner but so far any debris or oil slicks found on the water have been determined not to be connected with the missing airliner.  This according to a March 9, 2014 article by USA Today. The Chinese Satellite Image Search planes were dispatched Thursday to conduct a search of an area where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  After a series of search patterns, spotters were unable to find anything.  This according to a March 13, 2014 article by CBS News. U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Flew On for Hours On March 13. 2014 the Wall Street Journal reported that “Aviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. 777’s engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program.”    The article said that “investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted “with the intention of using it later for another purpose.” Course change On March 14, 2014 Reuters exclusively reported that “Military radar data suggests a Malaysia Airlines jetliner missing for nearly a week was deliberately flown hundreds of miles off course, heightening suspicions of foul play among investigators.”    The article said that there are indications that the missing 777 was “either being flown by the pilots or someone with knowledge of those waypoints.” U.S. Military Believes 777 May have Crashed in Indian Ocean A March 13, 2014 news update by England’s Daily Mail reported that the “U.S. military say they believe missing Malaysian jet has crashed in the Indian Ocean and send navy vessel to the area.”   The article said, “U.S. destroyer USS Kidd is now reportedly being moved in to search the area, while Malaysia was due to ask for radar data from India and other neighbouring countries to see if they can trace the plane flying north west.” Stolen Passports used to board missing airliner According to a timeline in a March 10,2014 article by Britain’s Telegraph, Malaysian authorities are investigating the “identities of at least two other passengers in addition to two who were found to be using stolen passports.” Luigi Maraldi, shown on the left, whose name appeared on the passenger list, reported that his passport had been stolen.   Investigating the incident are the Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister along with their counterparts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Telegraph said, “Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is ‘examining additional suspect passports.'” In a later report , the Telegraph reported that “two men travelling on stolen passports on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that mysteriously disappeared on Saturday have been identified as Iranian nationals.”  The article said that the two Iranians “were travelling on passports belonging to Christian Kozel, an 30-year-old Austrian, and Luigi Maraldi, a 37-year-old Italian.” Two Iranian Nationals boarded the plane Security camera photos of the Iranian passengers using stolen passports were released on March 11.1. According to a March 11, 2014 article by Fox News , images “showed the two Iranian men boarding a plane at the same time. Interpol secretary general Ronald K. Noble said Tuesday the two men traveled to Malaysia on their Iranian passports, then apparently switched to the stolen Austrian and Italian documents.”   Noble added, that “recent information about the men made terrorism a less likely cause of the plane’s disappearance, but that did not allay concerns about the ease of travel involving stolen passports.” Cell phones of missing passengers still ringing A few family members of passengers of  the missing MH370 airliner said that  “dialing the numbers resulted in ringing tones on the other end, even though the calls weren’t picked up.”  This according to a March 11, 2014 article by USA Today.    The families have encouraged the airline to search for the global positioning satellite (GPS) location of their loved ones’ mobile phones.  Experts in the cellular phone industry said  that a ringing phone is necessarily an indication that the calls went through.  Industry analyst Jeff Kagan told reporters, that the ringing is “just telling you that the network is in the process of finding and connecting to it.” Black hole theory shot down On March 19, 2014 CNN “anchor Don Lemon read a pair of tweets he received from viewers suggesting the plane’s disappearance could be the result of a “black hole,” Bermuda Triangle or an occurrence akin to the television series ‘Lost.'”  Lemon then pursued the possibility of a black hole encounter Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general, and said, “I know it’s preposterous, but is it preposterous, do you think, Mary?”  Schiavo agreed that it was preposterous and added,”a small black hole would suck in our entire universe. So we know it’s not that. The Bermuda Triangle is often weather, and ‘Lost’ is a TV show.” Click image to see video The example of the eRumor was an article posted on the FastCompany.Com website and was linked on the Drudge Report on March 10, 2014.

"NASA computers found the “missing day” of the Bible story about Joshua-Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/joshuaday/"," An email says that NASA (The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has stumbled across some computer generated evidence that the Bible is true.  A man named Harold Hill, a NASA consultant and president of the Curtis engine company, describes how NASA computers were looking back in time when they issued an alert that something was wrong.  There seemed to be a day missing from the calculations.  The scientists puzzled over this a long time until someone in their midst reflected that in the Bible, there’s a story about the day the sun stood still for the Hebrew leader Joshua.  This solves the puzzle, almost.  According to the computer, not an entire day was lost, but 23 hours and 20 minutes.  Now there’s a new problem.  What about the other 40 minutes?  That’s when the same employee remembers that there is another story in the Bible about a day when the sun moved backwards 10 degrees which, according to the employee, is an arc of 40 minutes…so the entire question of the missing day is solved! "," Except for the reference to the astronauts, this version of ‘the Missing Day’ story has been around for nearly 30 years.  Harold Hill was a real person and he was the president of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore, Maryland. He had converted to Christianity as an adult and became a popular speaker among Christian groups, because he was a successful businessman, claimed to be a consultant to NASA, and did presentations on science and the Bible.  One of his most popular presentations was the story of the Missing Day. Harold Hill apparently told the story without much notice until October 1969, when a columnist for a small American newspaper was told about one of his speeches and was given some notes about the Missing Day.  She was so intrigued, that she wrote it up and it was published. The columnist’s name was Mary Kathryn Bryan and her column appeared in the Spencer Evening World in Spencer, Indiana. According to the newspaper, the results of that particular column were ‘simply unbelievable’.  They started receiving requests from all over the world for reprints of the article, and finally stopped counting when the number of inquiries passed 1,500. The total number of cards, letters and telephone calls is now in the thousands. From that article, the Missing Day story found its way into untold numbers of magazines, newspapers, gospel tracts, books and now emails.  Harold Hill himself included it in a Christian book which he wrote. The story has several problems, however. One problem is that apart from Harold Hill, there is no known source for the NASA story.  For many years, whenever anyone wrote to him about it, he sent a form letter which said he had misplaced the source of the information, but would send everybody a copy when he found it.  The source never materialized. In his subsequent book, Hill dismissed all skepticism about the story and said that no substantiation was needed.  His attitude was that if people believed it and it drew them to spiritual things, it was justified. Another problem is that NASA has denied that Harold Hill was ever one of its consultants.  James S. Lacy, from the Office of Public Relations for NASA, wrote in a letter to a journalist that the only trace they could find of a Harold Hill having any connection with NASA was a person who was involved in contracting for the operations and maintenance of some diesel engine operations. Further, according to a letter I have from the NASA Public Affairs office in Washington, ‘There is no truth to the recurring story that NASA uncovered a lost day in the movement of the Earth.’ It is interesting to note that an attempt to explain Joshua’s long day from a scientific standpoint was published many years before Harold Hill’s NASA story. In the 1930s, Dr Harry Rimmer wrote a book called ‘The Harmony of Science and Scripture’, in which he drew from an 1890 book by Yale professor C.A. Totten. Using popular biblical chronologies of the time, Totten concluded that the world was created 4,000 years before the birth of Christ, on Sunday, September 22, 4000BC. However, he said that the calendar calculations showed that September 22 was actually a Monday, and not a Sunday, and that the error was probably because of Joshua’s missing day. Totten also makes reference to the Hezekiah story in 2 Kings and argues that this accounts for another missing 20 minutes or so. Totten’s calculations sound suspiciously familiar to the NASA story. The bottom line seems to be that there is a lot still missing about ‘the Missing Day’. Updated 7/24/05.

"," For some people, it’s sport to point out government waste and bureaucratic stupidity, but this story about the space pen won’t provide ammunition for it.  The government did not fund the development of the pen, it did not cost $12 million to perfect, and neither the Americans nor the Russians consider it desirable to use pencils in space.  In fact, both Americans and Russians use the space pen for their flights. The famous space pen, which is still a popular product today, was developed by Paul Fisher the founder of the Fisher pen company.  An engineer who improved ball point technology, he created his “bullet pen” in the 1940’s, which became one of the best-selling pens of the Twentieth Century. Later, he perfected a pen that was sealed with pressure inside of the cartridge that made the ink to flow regardless of gravity.  It also worked in high and low temperature extremes, underwater, and wrote on many kinds of surfaces.  According to the Fisher Pen company, after extensive testing, NASA chose the pen in 1967 for use by Apollo astronauts and it’s been a part of space travel ever since.  The company says it took Fisher about 2 years and $2 million to develop the space pen.  Prior to 1967, there were no pens that worked in space so there were pencils used, but there were concerns about pencil dust floating around the space capsules as well as fears that if the tip of a pencil broke off and drifted into the electronics, there would be problems.

According to published reports, Walters was employed as a truck driver in Southern California.  On July 2, 1982, he fastened 42 surplus balloons to a lawn chair and launched from his girlfriend’s San Pedro home.  He carried various supplies with him as well as a CB radio and a BB gun to shoot balloons one at a time to descend.  He didn’t realize how powerful the buoyancy of the balloons was.  When he cut a rope holding him to terra firma, he took off with such a jolt that another anchor rope broke under the stress and he shot upward so quickly that his eyeglasses flew to the ground.  He floated around the L.A. basin for several hours and reached altitudes of up to 16,000 feet.  According to an article in the New York Times the next day, Walters was spotted by pilots from both TWA and Delta Airlines.  It was cold at 16,000 feet and he started shooting some of his balloons to descend, but dropped his BB gun and had to wait for his rig to come down on its own.  He landed in a residential neighborhood in Long Beach where got tangled in some power lines, causing a power blackout.  He told reporters that his weather balloon flight had been a dream of more than 20 years.  Larry Walters died eleven years after his flight from what the Los Angeles Times described as a self-inflected gunshot wound.

Meanwhile, the liver intended for the Crystal was in San Diego, California.  An airplane that was to fly the liver to Houston developed pressurization problems.  When that news reached Elisabeth City, the Coca-Cola CEO asked his pilots whether they could also make a trip to San Diego to pick up the liver, but was told that would take longer than the amount of time that was left go get the transplant done.  The CEO then got on the phone to, among other people, the governor of California.  The result was that Navy Lt.

"," Blog posts that allege Bill Gates has admitted to the existence of chemtrails and has funded research for geoengineering are true. Gates first said geoengineering research, which includes chemtrails, could delay the impact of global warming by 20 or 30 years at a 2010 TED Talks event on geoengineering in Lithuania. “That’s just an insurance policy, and you’d hope you wouldn’t need to do that,” Gates said. “Some say we shouldn’t even work on the insurance policy… I’m not sure that’s wise, given the importance of the problem. “ A video of the TED Talks event can be viewed here . Gates went one step further in 2012. He established a multi-million fund for a small team of Harvard researchers to study geoengineering, the Guardian reported . “The objective is not to alter the climate, but simply to probe the processes at a micro scale,” David Keith, one of the researchers, told the Guardian. “The direct risk is very small.” There’s nothing illegal about the research, either. Small-scale research on chemtrails is allowed under a moratorium placed on geoengineering by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010. “…No climate-related geoengineering activities that may affect biodiversity (may) take place, until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities and appropriate consideration of the associated risks for the environment and biodiversity and associated social, economic and cultural impacts, with the exception of small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting,” the group said.

"," Various conspiracy theories have persisted since TWA flight 800 exploded near long island in 1996, but sufficient evidence doesn’t exist to support any of them. The most recent conspiracy theory echoes similar claims that the airplane was taken down by a surface-to-air missile strike. The story fails to name a credible source and remains unproven. In fact, the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) rejected a petition to reopen the investigation into the crash in July 2013 based on similar claims. The petitioners, a group called the TWA 800 Project, claimed a“detonation or high-velocity explosion” caused the crash. Among the petitioners was former NTSB Investigator Hank Hughes. “Our investigations are never ‘closed,’” Acting NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart said. “We always remain open to the presentation of new evidence. Before responding to the petition, NTSB staff met with the petitioners’ representatives and listened to an eyewitness who described what he saw on the night of the accident. After a thorough review of all the information provided by the petitioners, the NTSB denied the petition in its entirety because the evidence and analysis presented did not show the original findings were incorrect.” The NTSB held a media briefing in front of the reconstructed Boeing 737 in which investigators said there was no way a missile or bomb destroyed the airplane in July 2013. Hughes and other former NTSB staff members who were critical of the investigation were not allowed to attend, Flying Magazine reports . A documentary, “TWA Flight 800,” that aired on cable television on the anniversary of the crash in 2013 also fueled skepticism. Former NTSB Board Member John Goglia, who spent four years investigating the crash in the 1990s, said the petition and film don’t add up in a column published by Forbes in June 2013. Goglia summarized the petition: 1) radar data that allegedly shows an explosion next to the aircraft; 2) eyewitness accounts of flashes of light traveling from the ground up that were allegedly discounted; 3) trace amounts of chemical residue that were found; and 4) aircraft wreckage that was inconsistent with a center fuel tank explosion. In addition, they allege a conspiracy by the NTSB and FBI to destroy and cover-up evidence. Goglia contends that eyewitness accounts of a “flash” in the sky just before the airplane blew up were not supported by radar evidence. The fuselage wreckage also did not show any evidence of an explosion next to the aircraft. The evidence reveals, Goglia said, that the airplane exploded internally: The film ignores significant physical evidence that the center fuel tank exploded. More specifically, the evidence indicates that the fuel tank over-pressurized, tore apart significant wing structure and ejected pieces from inside the fuel tank. Those inner fuel tank pieces were found in the “red” debris field – that is the debris field closest to JFK, where the aircraft took off, indicating that the fuel tank pieces were among the first pieces to leave the aircraft. The aircraft fuel tank and surrounding floor and ceiling debris show metal pieces bowed consistent with extreme pressure from inside the fuel tank. Goglia also said that nobody claimed throughout the entire investigation — including petitioner Hughes — that evidence had been tampered with or was concealed. Conspiracy theories will persist about the explosion of TWA flight 800. Unless they are accompanied by new evidence or credible sources, however, they will remain conspiracy theories.

"It’s against the law for Americans to have contact with space aliens-Fiction!","2015-03-17 17:58:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aliens/"," This message says that a law already passed by Congress makes it illegal to have contact with a space alien and establishes penalties for anybody who does. It specifies Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations. "," Several things to say about this story. First, the section of the Code of Federal Regulations that it is referring to is Title 14, Chapter V, Section 1211. Title 14 is the part of the code dealing with aviation and space and sections 1211 through 1299 specifically regulate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Section 1211 was added in 1969 when the U.S. would be bringing a space vehicle and astronauts back to earth from a mission to the moon. The section was designed to protect the earth from any contamination that may have been picked up during the trip and did not specifically describe contact with alien beings or UFO’s. The wording from Section 1211 part 100 says, ” NASA policy, responsibility and authority to guard the Earth against any harmful contamination or adverse changes in its environment resulting from personnel, spacecraft and other property returning to the [earth] after landing on or coming within the atmospheric envelope of a celestial body…” There is no mention of alien beings or vehicles. Section 1211 was taken out of the Code of Federal Regulations in 1991. An announcement in the 1991 code says that the section was removed “…since it has served its purpose and is no longer in keeping with current policy.” A complete reading of the regulation makes it clear that it applied to any manned or unmanned space mission that lands or comes within the “atmospheric envelope of a celestial body.” That would apply to anyone who has been into space, not all American citizens. It didn’t prohibit contact with extraterrestrials. It merely specified what regulations would affect a mission’s return to earth to protect us from space contamination. Also, although the government has denied that there have been known contacts with extraterrestrial beings or vehicles, there has never been, to our knowledge, a governmental position that there could not be.

"Iranian pilot of hijacked flight 93 to be presented with Medal of Honor-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/iranianpilot/"," This talks about Hossein Mahmoudi, said to be the Iranian pilot of United  flight #93, which crashed in Pennsylvania on the day of the terrorist hijackings in September, 2001.  He is described as having been honored by a letter from President Bush to his family.  He is said to have bravely fought off the hijackers while at the same time attempting to make sure his plane did not come down in a populated area. "," There is virtually nothing in this eRumor that is true.  There       is no record that we can find of a Hossein Mahmoudi among the crew       or passengers on United Flight # 93.  According to United       Airlines, the pilot was Captain Jason Dahl; the first officer was Leroy       Homer. The Congressional Medal of Honor is not presented to civilians. It’s odd that in the eRumor (below), he is known as “Mr.       93” on a football message board.  Coincidence that this is the       same number as the flight? Also, the last report we knew of, there was not enough good       information on the flight recorders to have concluded what is       described about the crew’s conduct during the hijacking.

"Christian airline pilots being paired with non-Christian ones in case of rapture-Fiction!","2015-03-17 16:36:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/incaseofrapture/"," Some airline companies schedule Christian pilots along with non-Christian pilots in case the Biblical “rapture” takes place and the Christian pilot suddenly disappears. "," There is no evidence of this and there are a couple of problems with       the eRumor. One is that not all Christians believe in the sudden, unexpected       disappearance of Christians in a rapture. The other is that in order for an airline to make this policy, there       not only needs to be agreement within the company on the theology of       a rapture, but there also needs to be a company standard as to who       is or is not a Christian.  Can you imagine the fallout from       that?  “Joe, you are flying with Fred today because you’re       obviously not going to heaven.” ","Space - Aviation"

"Missouri Skydiver lovers who died together-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:15","https://www.truthorfiction.com/missouriskydivers/"," According to this eRumor, 25-year-old Laurie Kern and her boyfriend, 26-year-old Matt Pratruba, of Missouri decided to try skydiving.  She was reluctant, but he talked her into it.  When they got into the air, something went wrong with the airplane.  The pilot told them to jump, which they did, and fell to their deaths because neither parachute opened.  The pilot survived, but never flew again.  This happened in 1996 and was reported in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper.  The moral to the story is, “Is it really worth it?” "," None of the facts in this story has checked out with newspaper or public records.  It seems to have been written by someone who is terrified of the thought of skydiving and wanted to have a tale that would support that fear.  There is no story in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from 1982 to the present with any of these names.  There is only one skydiving death reported, a woman who collided with a tractor while attempting to land.  There are no stories in that time-period with the name “Pratruba” and no record of the pilot.  Additionally, there are no deaths of any cause to a Laurie Kern or Matt Pratruba during that period in Missouri.  The facts about the airplane emergency, the parachutes that would not open, and the pilot vowing to never fly again are not very realistic. The writer of the story looked at skydiving through his or her own eyes and said “it’s not worth it” and very likely wanted others to feel the same.  Jumping out of airplanes may not appeal to everyone, but when done properly, it is not a death sentence either.

"The terrorist flight number that tells the story in graphics-Fiction!","2015-03-16 17:08:11","https://www.truthorfiction.com/flightnumber/"," An email says that the flight number of one of the airliners hijacked by terrorists on September 11 is “Q33NY.”  If you highlight that flight number in Microsoft Word and change the font to one called “Wingdings,” you’ll see a graphical representation of the hijacking including an airliner, the twin towers, death, and the Star of David. "," This is a hoax, but judging from the emails we’re getting, people want something about it to be true. It is built upon the previously known fact that “NYC” has corresponding symbols in Wingdings that seem to have destructive meaning too. “Q33NY” is not associated in any way with any of the hijacked airliners.  It is not one of the flight numbers.  It is not the tail (registration) number of any of the airplanes (we have the actual tail numbers below), and was not a designation on radar that day, and is not the identity of the subway tunnel leading to the airport or the World Trade Center.  It’s not one of the gate numbers.  With few exceptions, all civilian aircraft in the U.S. have a tail number that begins with “N.”  TruthOrFiction.com has searched the FAA database that includes all airliners and found no airplane with Q33NY or any that begin with “Q” at all. There’s been a bit of mischief with this eRumor along the way.  The original version is the one we have below.  It clearly stated it was referring to the “flight number.”  It was easily demonstrated, however, that was not a flight number of any of the hijacked jets.  Other versions started circulating that said it was the “tail number” or the “registration number.”  More recently, some versions are making the rounds that claim it was the gate number. Here is the information about each flight: … American Airlines flight #11 . Took off from Boston destined for Los Angeles. Struck the World Trade Center. The tail # was N334AA. … United Airlines flight #175. Took off from Boston destined for Los Angeles. Struck the World Trade Center. The tail # was N612UA. … American Airlines flight  #77 . Took off from Dulles near Washington D.C. destined for Los Angeles. Struck the Pentagon. The aircraft tail # was N644AA. … United Airlines flight #93. Took off from Newark destined for San Francisco. C rashed in Pennsylvania was flight #93. The tail # was N591UA. The “Wingdings” font in Microsoft Word is one that is a collection of symbols rather than letters.  It is true that if you use “Q33NY” in Windings, you’ll get the sequence of symbols suggested but it’s irrelevant.

"," There was a delay between the Thunderbird flyover and the scheduled air show that followed the graduation ceremony according to a May 23, 2012 article in the Colorado Springs Gazette , but the delay happens every year. A Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs told TruthOrFiction.com that the delay was normal and had nothing to do with the President’s departure from the area. This portion of the Air Force Academy graduation was something to see. At the very end of the graduation ceremony the Master of Ceremonies announced that the Class of 2012 was dismissed.  At that moment the graduates tossed their combination caps in the air and the Thunderbirds perform their flyover. Once the caps are in the air children from the audience are released into the graduate area to retrieve the tossed caps and are allowed to keep them as a souvenir. The children are then escorted to an area where their parents can meet up with them to return them to their seats. An information page showing the scheduled events involving the graduation is posted on the Academy web site, which shows the air show beginning approximately thirty minutes after the close of the graduation ceremony. Click here for schedule. Updated 2013: President Obama spoke at the U.S. Naval academy commencement ceremony on May 24, 2013 .   It is not required that a sitting U.S. President attend the commencement ceremonies every year for all the military academies.   Vice President Biden spoke to the class of 2009 and Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley was the 2013 commencement speaker at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 2013 the Thunderbirds were unable to make the traditional flyover because of sequestration but their was a flyover of historical World War II aircraft by the Texas Flying Legends.  This according to an article in the Commemorative Air Force web site .  The article said, ‘Support for these flyovers is also being provided by the Texas Flying Legends, Commemorative Air Force and the National Museum of World War II Aviation.”  The Commemorative Air Force is an organization that was founded to “acquire, restore and preserve in flying condition a complete collection of combat aircraft which were flown by all military services of the United States.” Posted 06/18/12   Updated 06./04/13 ","Space - Aviation"
