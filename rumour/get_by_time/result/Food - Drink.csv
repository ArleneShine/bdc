"Plastic Rice Being Sold in China, Nigeria, Jamaica-Unproven!","2016-12-14 13:47:01","https://www.truthorfiction.com/plastic-rice-sold-china-nigeria-jamaica/"," Warnings have gone viral about Chinese companies selling plastic rice, with some versions tied to a particular company called Wuchang Rice. "," Rumors about plastic rice or fake rice being sold in Chinese markets have been circulating since 2011 — but we couldn’t find any credible sources or confirmed instances to back those claims up. And there haven’t been any accounts of plastic rice being sold in the U.S. All of these plastic rice rumors seem to lead back to a 2011 report by the Korean-language newspaper Hong Kong Weekly that cited unnamed sources in reporting that eating one bowl of plastic rice was equivalent to eating an entire vinyl bag (an allegation that has been repeated countless times): …Some distributors are selling fake rice in Taiyuan, Shaanxi Province, and this rice is a mixture of potatoes, sweet potatoes and plastic. “This ‘plastic rice’ is made by forming potatoes and sweet potatoes into rice-like shape, then adding industrial synthetic resins,” said a food expert. “Since the rice is different from normal rice, it is hard like stone even when cooked. Moreover, the synthetic resin in it is very harmful to the human body.” One Chinese restaurant association official warns that eating three bowls of ‘plastic rice’ is the same as eating one vinyl bag. He added that since the rice is very dangerous there would be strict investigation on the rice factory. In the mean time, merchants say that as the fake rice can leave huge profits, it is still sold in mass quantity. This is not the first time for fake rice e sold in China. A Chinese television report has alleged that a company in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, has been producing a fake version of high-quality “Wuchang rice” by adding flavoring to ordinary rice. It’s entirely possible that vendors in Chinese markets were selling so-called plastic rice, but the report relies on unnamed sources and we couldn’t find any official confirmation one way or the other. Still, the report was picked up by American alternative and natural health websites like Natural News, which reported in February 2011 that “ Chinese Companies (are) Mass Producing Fake Rice Out of Plastic ,” citing the Weekly Hong Kong report. By late 2015, warnings about China selling plastic rice were still bouncing around American alternative health websites. These stories were citing a broadcast from the Blue Ocean Network (BON) that relied on the original 2011 Weekly Hong Kong plastic rice story as its source. It’s been implied in these new versions that Chinas has begun exporting plastic rice to other countries — but, again, there are no confirmed reports of that happening. Some have pointed to a YouTube clip that incorrectly identifies waste plastic being shredded into beads as the manufacturing of plastic rice. A story that appeared at AltHealth Works website in 2015 under the headline “ Chinese Companies Are Mass Producing Plastic Rice (and it Could Cause Series Health Problems)” has been shared on social media more than 135,000 times. Again, there’s no official indication that the claim is true. We did find one report that the New Dehli High Court heard a case on plastic rice in 2015 — but the court apparently rejected an application to test Chinese rice imports. In 2016, the plastic rice story took new life in Africa and Jamaica. Reports from Nigeria claimed that marketplace vendors were selling plastic rice — but, again, we couldn’t find any official confirmation of that. Reports about plastic rice in Jamaica was being imported from Guyana and Suriname were debunked by the Jamaica Customs Agency in December 2016, Caribbean 360 reports: On Monday, the JCA stopped the shipments and met with the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Bureau of Standards (BSJ), the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health, and the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), to verify whether the artificial rice was in fact in the country. The concern was triggered by a Television Jamaica report on Sunday, showing a woman cooking the product. However, Minister of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries Karl Samuda said yesterday there was no evidence of plastic rice in samples tested by the BSJ. “The BSJ was provided with samples… and, so far, I can assure the people of Jamaica that there is absolutely no evidence of any contamination of plastic within the samples tested,” he said. The minister said more samples will be taken from across the country to be tested and the BSJ had been asked to conduct island wide investigations into the source of all rice now in supermarkets. According to the Jamaica Observer, Jamaica imports rice from Trinidad and Tobago, Vietnam, India, United States, Guyana, Thailand, China, and Suriname. Samuda said yesterday that rice originating from Guyana and Suriname would be cleared to enter the island. Ultimately, none of these reports of plastic rice can be definitively confirmed or debunked. There has never been an official report of plastic rice being found, but that doesn’t mean marketplace sellers in China or Nigeria haven’t sold an imitation or synthetic form of rice to make money. This one is unproven. ","Food - Drink"
"Warnings About Shark Finning-Truth!","2016-08-17 14:53:23","https://www.truthorfiction.com/warnings-shark-finning-truth/"," The practice of shark finning involves fisherman cutting off shark fins and dumping their carcasses back into the ocean. "," Shark finning is a phenomenon that leads to the deaths of countless sharks each year and threatens ocean ecosystems. The practice of shark finning involves fisherman catching various shark species, cutting off their dorsal fin, and dumping the carcasses back into the water to die. One of the driving forces of shark finning has been the historic significance of shark fin soup in China. Chinese empowers once believet hat the dish had healing power and represented the triumph of man over beast, the Smithsonian Ocean Portal reports : In the past, Chinese Emperors favored the soup as a dish that honored guests because it was thought to have medicinal benefits and represented a victory against powerful sharks. This popularity has not faded with time, and has even expanded with China’s growing population. Today shark fin soup is still prevalent and has become a staple for more than just emperors on special occasions. As a result, fishermen have a large incentive to gather and sell shark fins. Because shark fins are far more valuable than other parts of the shark, fisherman routinely dump the less valuable shark carcasses back into the ocean to save room on their boats for the more valuable commodity, National Geographic reports : It will cost countries money to monitor the international trade in shark fins. But keep in mind that fins are a luxury product that fetch exorbitant prices. We saw one set of large great hammerhead fins on sale in Bangkok that was advertised for USD$1,100 per kilogram (about $500 per pound). Shark fin soup was selling for $365 a bowl at a nearby restaurant. There is money in this trade that could and should be redirected towards ensuring compliance with the new international law and promoting sustainability. Overall, researchers believe that humans kill more than 100 million sharks each year, which endangers the species and threatens to imbalance the ocean’s ecosystems since sharks play an important role in them. However, there is some good news. A government frugality drive and public awareness campaigns in China had led to a 70 percent decrease in fin soup consumption by 2014, the nonprofit WildAid reports : Prices of shark fin are falling in China by 50 percent-70 percent and sales have decreased by 82 percent according to a new report released last week by WildAid. “Evidence of Declines in Shark Fin Demand, China” compiles public opinion surveys, surveys of shark find vendors and traders in the markets of Guangzhou, China (the current center of China’s shark fin trade) and surveys of shark fin price data from Indonesian shark fishermen, as well trade statistics and media reports. The report also found rising public awareness with 85 percent of Chinese consumers surveyed online saying that they had given up shark fin soup within the last three years. Two-thirds of these respondents cited awareness campaigns as a reason for ending their shark fin consumption, while the second and third most popular reason given were that they “want to protect sharks” and that it is “cruel the way they kill sharks” — key messages of WildAid’s ongoing public awareness campaign. Similar steps have followed in the U.S. Legislation that would ban the trade of shark fins in the country was introduced in June 2016. Even though shark finning is illegal in U.S. waters, shark fins are routinely bought and sold in the country. The bill would make that illegal, nonprofit Ocean reports : Oceana also released a new report today demonstrating why Congress needs to pass a federal ban on the buying and selling of shark fin products. The demand for shark fins is one of the greatest threats facing shark populations around the world.  In fact, fins from as many as 73 million sharks end up in the global market every year. According to the new report, a nationwide ban on the trade of shark fins would reduce the international fin trade, improve enforcement of the current finning ban, and send a message to other countries that the United States recognizes shark finning as a cruel process that should not be allowed to continue. “Shark finning is cruel and wasteful and it’s putting some shark species at risk of extinction. The United States rightly decided to ban the trade of ivory and rhino horns—yet we still import shark fins, which can be the result of an equally brutal practice,” said Lora Snyder, campaign director at Oceana. “To protect sharks, we need to end the demand for shark fins. Today, the United States took an important step towards achieving this. We applaud the leadership of the bill’s supporters today in helping to end the shark fin trade in the United States.” ","Food - Drink"

"Budweiser Being Renamed “America”-Mostly Fiction!","2016-05-10 14:53:50","https://www.truthorfiction.com/budweiser-being-renamed-america/"," Reports that Budweiser is being rebranded “America” for the summer have swept social media. "," It’s true that “America” will replace “Budweiser” on labels this summer — but the seasonal packaging doesn’t mean that Budweiser is actually changing its name to America. The story went viral after Budweiser released a video that showed the new seasonal design for its beer labels being rolled out for the summer of 2016. The can features “America” written in Budweiser’s trademark cursive font with “E Pluribus Unum,” which is Latin for “Out of Many, One,” scrawled beneath it: Budweiser plans to use the seasonal labels from late May through the November presidential election. Reports like this one from an NBC News affiliate in New York have contributed to rumors that Budweiser is actually renaming itself  “America” for the summer: Budweiser, now owned by Belgium’s AB Inbev, will rename its beer America this summer and alter its labels with images and phrases affiliated with the republic. However, including the name “America” on labels is hardly the same as officially renaming or rebranding a company. Besides, the Budweiser name and logo still prominently appears on the label. This a well-planned and executed marketing campaign. That’s why we’re calling it “mostly fiction.” ","Food - Drink"

"," A fake news website is behind false reports that Coca-Cola has recalled its Dasani brand water. The story first appeared at the fake news website News 4 , which has been designed to look like a local television news station to trick readers into believing that it’s a credible news source. The story , which appeared under the headline, “Coca-Cola Recalls Dasani Water After Clear Parasite Worm Was Found in Bottles Across U.S” reports that a “major recall” had been issued for “several thousand bottles” of Dasani drinking water: Even though the majority of the impurities have admittedly been removed from Dasani water, and minerals added back in, these parasites have somehow worked their way into their supposedly“clean” water system which has been passed on to the consumer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has shut down the manufacturing facility and issued a major recall on the brand. Do not drink this water! The FDA is recommending that if you have no choice but to consume the water, you MUST boil the water first to kill the parasite. Otherwise, it will host itself in your stomach lining and intestine and breed offsprings. News 4 doesn’t clearly identify itself as a fake news website, but a review of its “news coverage” tells the story. Stories about t he FDA closing a McDonald’s meat packing plant after a man was found having sex with a cow , and ab out Donald Trump’s supporters dying after trying the “Plastic Bag Challenge” Internet trend rounded out its top stories. Despite the website’s lack of credibility, Coca-Cola issued a statement clarifying that it had not recalled its Dasani water due to parasites: Various on-line “reports” of a water recall targeting our Dasani® brand are being circulated (“shared”) via social platforms, emails and even word-of-mouth.   The article, credited as originating from a “news” source, surfaced on a website suggesting to “consume healthy food.”  Below is an excerpt from the article providing information confirmed to be false and inflammatory. In communications between Greg Babb, Corporate Director of Quality and Sustainability for Coca-Cola UNITED, and The Coca-Cola Company regarding the information, The Coca-Cola Company confirmed, “The source of this false and inflammatory information about our brand is a hoax news website. There is no recall of DASANI being conducted in the U.S., so please confidently continue to enjoy DASANI bottled water.” So, reports that Coca-Cola recalled Dasani over worm parasites are totally false.

"Dr Pepper Saying Goodbye in Summer 2016-Fiction!","2016-04-18 17:54:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dr-pepper-saying-goodbye-summer-2016-fiction/"," Reports that Dr Pepper is ending production after being acquired by Coca-Cola are false. "," There’s no truth to reports that Dr Pepper is ending production. Rumors of Dr Pepper’s demise surfaced on social media in April 2016 after old reports about a Dr Pepper bottling plant closing from 2012 was re-reported as breaking news. Dr Pepper Bottling Co operated the plant in Dublin, Texas, under a licensing agreement with the Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS). Under the agreement, the Dr Pepper Bottling Co was licensed to produce and market “Dublin Dr Pepper,” a vintage version of Dr Pepper made with real can sugar and packaged in vintage bottles, a Fort Worth-based NBC affiliate reports . In 2011, DPS filed a lawsuit in 2011 that claimed the Dublin Dr Pepper distributor had broken terms of the licensing agreement by distributing outside of an agreed upon territory. After a legal battle, the plant dropped Dublin Dr Pepper production to end the lawsuit, the Dallas News reports : But “Dublin Dr Pepper,” the sugar-sweetened drink at the heart of the legal battle, will cease to exist and 14 of the bottler’s 40 workers, mostly in the warehouse and distribution operation, are out of jobs. Dr Pepper Snapple will now distribute Dr Pepper sweetened with cane sugar throughout Dublin’s former territory and continue to sell it in other areas of Texas, including Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Waco. The soda will be the same product Dublin sold but will not make reference to Dublin on the label. Somehow the demise of Dublin Dr Pepper reignited on social media in April 2016, and some were incorrectly led to believe that production of Dr Pepper would stop in the summer of 2016. Some of those reports claimed that Coca-Cola had bought the Dr Brand. Both are false — Dr Pepper isn’t ending production, and Coca-Cola didn’t buy the Dr Pepper brand. After a few days of the rumor floating around social media, Dr Pepper even released an animated graphic to “crush the rumor” that Dr Pepper was ending production: So, given all that, we’re calling this one fiction.

If u contact ur closest chic fil a close to ur due date or right after u have the baby they offer a new mom meal for FREE. It’s a small platter, 4 large fries or fruit, a gallon of lemonade or tea, and cookies. Pretty cool!!!! So ladies, contact them when its time for this awesome deal. Tag expecting mothers u know. In-store promotions at Chic-fil-A like this one have caused confusion in the past. Last year, it was widely reported that all Chic-fil-A restaurants had a “missing man table” set to honor combat veterans who have gone missing in action. We found that a number of restaurants in the Atlanta market had elected to do that, but that it wasn’t a companywide policy. Click here for that story. The same is true for the free meal for new mothers claim. There’s no definitive list of Chic-fil-A locations that offer free meals for new mom.

It’s a small nugget tray, fruit tray, a gallon of sweet tea and a gift for baby. You can sign up in their restaurant, or call your local Chick-fil-A to see if they participate in this program. And the free meal for new moms has also undoubtedly been confused with Chic-fil-A’s “ Mom Valet ” or “ Mommy VIP Service ” that some locations rolled out in early 2016. The service enables parents to place an order at the drive-thru window, and then an employee will make up a table inside for the family so they don’t have to stand in line. Again, the only sure way to know exactly what promotions and services your local Chic-fil-A locations offer to mothers is to check with individual restaurant operators. ","Food - Drink"
"Cadbury Drops the Word Easter From Packaging-Mostly Fiction!","2016-03-25 12:10:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/cadbury-drops-word-easter-packaging/"," Cadbury has dropped the word “Easter” from the packaging for its chocolate eggs and bunnies. "," Cadbury hasn’t dropped the word “Easter” from its chocolate eggs and bunnies — but the word doesn’t’ appear prominently on the front of packaging, either. Reports that Cadbury had “quietly dropped” the word Easter from its seasonal candy packaging gained momentum after a report appeared in the U.K. Daily Telegraph under the headline, “Easter Quietly Dropped from Easter Eggs.” The report goes on to cite claims made by the Meaningful Chocolate Company that Cadbury and other manufacturers had phased out the word Easter: Growing numbers of chocolate eggs are on sale in the UK without any mention of the word “Easter” on the front of the packaging. Many of Britain’s best known brands have quietly dropped the name of the Christian festival from their main branding, now selling Easter products labelled simply as “chocolate egg” or even “egg”, it has been claimed. The allegation was highlighted by the makers of the “Real Easter Egg”, a fair trade chocolate product which carries a Christian message instead of pictures of bunnies and chicks and donates its profits to charity. The Meaningful Chocolate Company, based in Manchester, was set up six years ago in an attempt to reintroduce Easter eggs with references to the Easter story and Advent calendars featuring nativity scenes to the mainstream market. But since then, according to the company’s founder David Marshall, the secularizing trend has been gone further, with many products now seemingly dropping references to Easter from the title altogether. “It looks like there is a trend. A lot of businesses are not comfortable with the religious aspect of the festival.” David Marshall, The Meaningful Chocolate Company examples highlighted by the firm include the Cadbury Easter Egg Trail Pack, whose label now reads simply “Egg Hunt Pack”. It’s true that Cadbury eggs and bunnies don’t have “Easter” prominently displayed on the front of individual packaging — but claims that Cadbury has entirely “dropped” Easter aren’t true, either. In the 2016 Easter season, the company was clearly marketing its chocolate eggs, bunnies and chicks as Easter candy: Similarly, Cadbury’s Twitter feed was flush with references to Easter and the Easter bunny: A company spokesperson said the company doesn’t include the word “Easter” on the front of product labels because they simply didn’t think it was necessary — and noted that “Easter” appears on the back of the product labels: “Easter is stated on our Easter Eggs on the back of the pack — most of our Easter Eggs don’t say Easter or Egg on the front as we don’t feel the need to tell people this. It is very obvious through the packaging that it is an Easter egg. We do not have a policy to remove the word “Easter” from our packs or marketing. Some of our marketing states Easter and some just Egg.” So, for all of those reasons, we’re calling reports that Cadbury has “quietly dropped” the word “Easter” mostly fiction. ","Food - Drink"

"," Bumble Bee Tuna issued a product recall in March 2016 — but it had nothing to do with human remains being mixed into a batch of tuna. That rumor can be traced back to The Rocket Report , a fake news website. A report appearing under the headline “Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna” started false rumors about the Bumble Bee Tuna recall: AP – On Monday, Bumble Bee Foods and 2 employees were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. José Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270° during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened. The company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. Within days of being posted, the false report was shared more than 70,000 times on social media sites. Taken at face value, the report sparked a lot of concern among tuna eaters, but The Rocket Report’s disclaimer clearly states that it’s not a trusted news source: The Racket Report is a news web publication with news articles, inspired by real news events. The articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways. A few articles are for entertainment purposes only. The purpose of said stories is to entertain and amuse and not to disparage any persons, institutions, in anyway and no malice is intended towards anyone or anything, nor should any be construed from the fictional stories. That means some stories on this website are fictitious. Any resemblance to persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental or is intended purely as a spoof of such person and is not intended to communicate any true or factual information about that person. The false report about human remains being mixed into Bumble Bee tuna is especially misleading because even though it’s completely false, it’s based on two things that actually happened years apart. First, Bumble Bee actually issued a voluntary tuna recall in March 2016 , at the time time when the false news report went viral. The recall had nothing to do with human remains. Rather, it was due to deviations in the “commercial sterilization process” at a co-pack facility not owned or operated by Bumble Bee. The recall impacted about 32,000 cases of Chunk Light tuna. Second, Jose Melena was an actual Bumble Bee employee who was killed in a horrific workplace accident. Melena was cooked alive in 12,000 pounds of tuna fish back in 2012. The company said that “major error” resulted in the accidental death, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports . So, the report that Bumble Bee recalled tuna because human remains had been mixed into it are totally false. But the report is especially misleading because it blends together two different, actual events that happened years apart to create a false story. ","Food - Drink"
"Banana and Kiwi Grow Together-Fiction!","2016-03-18 13:20:21","https://www.truthorfiction.com/banana-kiwi-grow-together/"," A viral video claims that combining banana and kiwi scraps allows you to grow a hybrid fruit that is a combination of the two. "," Bananas and kiwi won’t grow as one if you plant clippings from the two fruits together. That rumor started as an April Fool’s Day joke, but the punch line has since been lost on lots of people. A video posted to the Kin Community YouTube channel on April 1, 2014, shows DIY crafter Robert Mahar showing viewers how to do amazing things with the scraps of fruits and vegetables that are thrown away every day. In the video, which can be viewed here , Mahar is first shown re-growing a head of lettuce and radishes by placing scraps from the vegetables in a dish of water. Then, the gag peaks as Mahar combines the cut ends of banana and kiwi, places them in dirt, and then cuts into a full-grown banana-kiwi hybrid fruit. Buried at the very bottom of notes about the video is a subtle reference to April Fool’s Day, which many of the video’s more than 600,000 viewers missed: New fruit hybrids are often a hit and miss process of experimentation and results are not guaranteed. However, if you are able to successfully grow the beautiful banana and kiwi combination demonstrated in this video, we recommend you proceed directly to your corner market and purchase a lottery ticket. Wishing you a very happy April Fool’s Day! In reality, some hybrid fruits are a reality. Hybrid fruit results when two plants from the same botanical species are cross-pollinated (not squished together and planted). And while this is possible, the process is meticulous and takes years, the Daily Beast reports : A hybrid fruit is the result of cross-pollination of two plants from the same species or genus. When humans intervene in the process by selecting plants to pollinate for intentional results, the procedure is painstakingly meticulous and monitored. It may take years of selective breeding to produce a desired fruit. The plum-apricot hybrid known as the “pluot” took biologist Floyd Zaiger around 20 years to perfect before he introduced it to the market. Different from open-pollination (which is uncontrolled or varied pollination by insects, birds, winds, or natural causes), when the human hand brushes pollen from the male flower of one plant to the stigma of the flower of a female plant this type of hand-pollination delivers controlled results. So, long story short, the claim that bananas and kiwi grow together is nothing more than an April Fool’s Day joke taken out of context.","Food - Drink"

The real question is whether or not treated wastewater from oil refineries is safe to use for crop irrigation, or if, as the rumor claims, it’s “toxic.” Mother Jones broke news that food producers in southern California had been using oil wastewater to irrigate crops in July 2015. The story goes that California’s long drought, and regulations that prohibit oil companies from pumping wastewater from oil production back into the ground, have made a perfect recipe for oil wastewater irrigation, Mother Jones reports : The Cawelo Water District blends oil wastewater with water from other sources such as the Kern River before sending it to farms. Last month, Food & Water Watch received from the district the names and addresses of companies that use its water. A few examples of the brands owned or supplied by those companies are listed below (though some of their fruits and vegetables may come from other parts of the state).

The Resnicks, who also own Fiji Water, POM Wonderful, and the world’s largest pistachio and almond growing operation, aremajor players in California water politics. For its part, Wonderful Halos has responded to repeated questions on Facebook about whether or not it uses oilfield wastewater with the same response: Wonderful Halos is deeply committed to bringing you the highest-quality, most nutritious, and best-tasting citrus available. Our crops are irrigated with water from a variety of sources, all of which meet or exceed the standards for agricultural irrigation. To be sure, all of our produce is continuously and rigorously tested as part of our strict quality control process and adhere to all FDA regulations and guidelines. We’re proud of the delicious, premium citrus we grow, harvest and deliver to our customers around the world. The State Water Resources Control Board requires regular tests of oilfield water used for irrigation, but Mother Jones notes, it has not set limits for contaminants found in the water. One such test found that irrigation water supplied from Chevron had higher concentrations of the carcinogen benzene than is allowed in drinking water.But, given that recycled wastewater is mixed with water from other sources, it’s not clear what the benzene levels would be in water from various sources that’s applied to crops. The California Council on Science and Technology partnered with UC-Berkley researchers on an independent assessment that concluded : Operators in California use about 800 acre-feet (about a million m3) of water per year for hydraulic fracturing. This does not represent a large amount of freshwater compared to other human water use. Depending on the local scarcity of water, recycling the water used to create hydraulic fractures may have modest benefits. Far more water is used for enhanced oil recovery using water or steam flooding in the same fields, and large volumes of water of various salinities and qualities get produced along with the oil. Produced water from oil and gas production, appropriately tested and treated, has potential for beneficial reuse. The report recommends identifying opportunities for water conservation and reuse in the oil and gas industry as a whole. The Los Angeles Times reported in May 2015 that Chevron sells 21 million gallons of treated oilfield wastewater to farmers in central California every day. It’s used to irrigate about 45,000 acres of crops. State officials praised oilfied water recycling as a solution to the state’s drought, and took steps last year to shore up regulation and testing, the Times reports : Until now, government authorities have only required limited testing of recycled irrigation water, checking for naturally occurring toxins such as salts and arsenic, using decades-old monitoring standards. They haven’t screened for the range of chemicals used in modern oil production. No one knows whether nuts, citrus or other crops grown with the recycled oil field water have been contaminated. Farmers may test crops for pests or disease, but they don’t check for water-borne chemicals. Instead, they rely on oversight by state and local water authorities. But experts say that testing of both the water and the produce should be expanded. Last month, the Central Valley water authority, which regulates the water recycling program, notified all oil producers of new, broader testing requirements and ordered the companies to begin checking for chemicals covered under California’s new fracking disclosure regulations. The law, which legislators approved last year, requires oil companies to tell the state which chemicals they use in oil-extraction processes. The water authority gave producers until June 15 to report their results. So, it’s true that treated wastewater from oil production is used to irrigate crops (possibly including Wonderful Halos), but whether or not the practice is safe is still up in the air.

"Parmesan Cheese Contains Wood Pulp-Fiction!","2016-02-18 13:48:39","https://www.truthorfiction.com/parmesan-cheese-contains-wood-pulp/"," Reports have run rampant that Parmesan cheese contains wood pulp. "," Don’t believe headlines that claim wood pulp is added to Parmesan cheese. It’s true that a food additive called cellulose that can be extracted from wood pulp is added to Parmesan cheese (and many processed foods), but reports about wood chips in cheese have gotten carried away. First, lets take a look at what, exactly, cellulose is. It’s a long chain of linked sugar molecules found in all plant material, including wood. In wood, cellulose is found inside fibrous strands called lignin that give wood its strength. In order to be used as a food additive, cellulose has to be separated from the lignin through a chemical process. John Coupland, a food scientist at Penn State, said cellulose can be extracted from virtually any plant material and used as a food additive Its source doesn’t really matter: “A good way to think about it is to ask, ‘Would our food be any better or worse if the cellulose used was sourced from another plant?’ Cellulose is just a molecule, and probably one we want more of in our diets.” Coupland’s point is that cellulose is a sugar molecule that has to be extracted from wood pulp (or another plant material) before it can be used as a food additive. So, wood pulp isn’t added to Parmesan cheese — a sugar molecule extracted from wood pulp is. Given that, it’s false to say that Parmesan cheese contains wood pulp. Parmesan cheese, along with most processed foods, contains powdered cellulose often extracted from wood pulp. It’s used as an anti-caking agent to make dairy products creamy and prevent clumping, the Wall Street Journal reports . The human body doesn’t digest or absorb cellulose. It can actually act as natural laxative before it’s passed from the body within a few days, the FDA reports : Cellulose is a major constituent of many foods of plant origin. As such it is a significant portion of the diet, but is neither degraded nor absorbed. Cellulose derivatives considered in this report are virtually unabsorbed and little or no degradation of absorbed and little or no degradation of absorbable products occurs in the human digestive tract. In man, consumption of large amounts appears to have no effect other than providing dietary bulk, reducing the nutritive value of such foodstuffs and possibly exerting a laxative effect. However, the existence of certain data and the different categorization of cellulose and the several cellulose derivatives on the GRAS list suggest that the Select Committee should render a separate opinion on each substance considered in this report. Cellulose is generally considered safe by the FDA. In cheese products, it can’t account for more than 2-4% of the total product. And while thousands of processed foods contain cellulose, Parmesan cheese was singled out for allegedly containing “wood pulp” because cheese makers have been accused of adding more cellulose than allowed to hard cheese products. The controversy goes back to 2012 when the FDA discovered that Castle Cheese in Pennsylvania had added more cellulose than allowed to its “100% natural Parmesan cheese,” as well as cheaper cheddar cheese, to save money. Michelle Myrter, the president and owner of Castle Cheese, faces criminal charges that carry a year of prison time and a $100,000 fine. Then, in February 2016, Bloomberg Business reported that it had tested Parmesan cheese samples from big box stores and found some of them had cellulose levels exceeding FDA limits. The story, which was inaccurately headlined, “The Parmesan Cheese You Sprinkle on Your Penne Could Be Wood,” reports : Cellulose is a safe additive, and an acceptable level is 2 percent to 4 percent, according to Dean Sommer, a cheese technologist at the Center for Dairy Research in Madison, Wisconsin. Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, was 8.8 percent cellulose, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese registered 7.8 percent, according to test results. Whole Foods 365 brand didn’t list cellulose as an ingredient on the label, but still tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent. So, it’s true that a sugar molecule found in wood pulp is added to processed foods like Parmesan cheese. It’s also true that sometimes it’s added to foods at higher levels than the FDA allows. But the rumor’s central claim that wood pulp is added to Parmesan cheese is false. ","Food - Drink"
"Heinz Ketchup Banned in Israel; It Doesn’t Contain Enough Tomatoes","2016-02-17 08:33:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/heinz-ketchup-banned-in-israel-it-doesnt-contain-enough-tomatoes/"," Heinz ketchup has been banned in Israel because it doesn’t contain enough tomatoes to be called “ketchup” under Israeli food standards. "," Israel hasn’t banned Heinz ketchup, but the country’s health ministry required the brand to start labeling some products as “tomato seasoning” instead of ketchup in 2015. Osem, the biggest ketchup producer in Israel and Heinz’s biggest competitor there, stirred up the controversy. In January 2015, Osem CEO Nizan Goldberg sent a letter to retailers that claimed independent testing showed that Heinz Tomato Ketchup contained far less tomato concentrate than its labels claimed: We wish to bring it to your attention that we recently discovered that the product marketed as Heinz 700g ketchup only contains about 21% tomato concentrate and not the 61% tomato concentrate as advertised on the product. The product has been tested in a leading European external laboratory, which produced these findings. The incorrect indication of tomato concentrate in the products severely misleads the Israeli consumer public and is a violation of the provisions of the law to protect consumers. This information has also been sent to the Diplomat company and the authorities. Moreover, under Israeli law, the presence of lower quantities of fortified tomato concentrate prevents the product from being called ketchup and it cannot be sold as such. Diplomat, the company that distributes Heinz ketchup in Israel, fired back with a strongly worded statement of its own: “Obviously, Osem, which has a monopoly, would be happy if it were only possible to sell their product in Israel. But Osem’s claims have no substance.” By August 2015, however, Israel’s Health Ministry sided with Osem. The health ministry ruled that Hebrew language Heinz labels could no longer identify the product as ketchup because it didn’t meet minimum tomato concentrate standards. Instead, Heinz has to identify the product as “tomato seasoning” on Hebrew language labels. The health ministry’s ruling did not apply to English language labels, however. In an email to Newsweek , Heinz said Israeli customers continue to enjoy its ketchup despite it being reclassified in the country: “Ketchup fans in Israel continue to enjoy Heinz Tomato Ketchup, the world’s favourite ketchup first created by Heinz in 1876.” “The word ketchup is indicated in English on the front of the bottle while recognizing that the Israeli standard for ketchup has yet to be brought in line with U.S. and European accepted international standards, the back label of our ketchup sold in Israel reflects current local requirements for ingredient labelling and the Hebrew name for the product.” And the fight between Osem and Heinz is far from over. Heinz has reportedly petitioned the health ministry to change the country’s tomato solids requirements for ketchup, and the health ministry is apparently on board with that. So, it’s not true that Heinz ketchup has been banned in Israel. It is true, however, that Heinz is embroiled in a food fight with a competition that led to the health ministry’s decision to re-classify Heinz ketchup as Heinz tomato seasoning. That’s why we’re calling this one truth and fiction.","Food - Drink"
"Rat Meat Sold as Chicken Wings-Fiction!","2016-02-11 12:23:26","https://www.truthorfiction.com/rat-meat-sold-as-chicken-wings/"," The FDA allegedly issued a warning about rat meat being sold as chicken wings before Super Bowl 50. "," Rumors about rat meat being sold as chicken wings came from a fake news website. The fake news website, World News Daily Report , published a false report under the headline, “Rat Meat Sold As Chicken Wings: FDA Issues Warning Before Super Bowl.” According to the report: San Francisco, CA | The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is concerned about an estimated 300,000 pounds of counterfeit rat meat that has been sold as chicken wings in restaurants and grocery stores across America. FDA inspectors raised concerns when several illegal containers originating from China were seized by customs at the Port of San Francisco and were found to contain rat meat that was meant to be shipped to different meat processing plants across America and resold as chicken. The story went on to (falsely) report that 300,000 pounds of counterfeit rat meat was still believed to be in circulation. Given the timing of the report, just before the biggest chicken wing-eating event of the year, it quickly went viral. Within a week, the report was shared 26,000 times on social media sites.

"McDonald’s Hamburgers Won’t Rot for Years-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-02-09 13:18:13","https://www.truthorfiction.com/mcdonalds-hamburgers-dont-rot-for-years/"," Social media posts show images of burgers and fries from McDonald’s Happy Meals that sat untouched for years without decomposing, rotting or growing mold. "," McDonald’s food won’t decompose or rot for years if its stored in moisture-free conditions, but the same is true for most foods. Claims that food from McDonald’s Happy Meals won’t decompose after sitting untouched for years go back at least 20 years. They’re usually used to argue that food from McDonald’s and other fast food chains are packed with artificial preservatives that render them unable to rot, which means that they are unnatural, unhealthy food options. One of the first and most well documented accounts of forever burgers came from Karen Hanrahan, the administrator of the wellness site Best of Mother Earth . In teaching a workshop titled “Healthy Choices for Children,” Hanrahan famously used a McDonald’s hamburger from 1996 that hadn’t decayed as a prop to demonstrate that there are healthier food options available for children. In 2008, Hanrahan blogged : This is a hamburger from McDonalds that I purchased in 1996. That was 12 years ago. Note that it looks exactly like it did the very day I bought it. The flecks on the burger are crumbs from the bun. The burger is starting to crumble a bit. It has the oddest smell. The Happy Meal Art Project is another example of the un-decomposing McDonald’s burger in popular culture. Its creators photographed a McDonald’s burger every day for 137 days, noting the lack of decomposition. Similar examples can be found across the web, and especially on social media sites. Lucky for us, Serious Eats has logged some serious research . The website documented how nine different burgers — different varieties made at home and by McDonald’s — decomposed. After being left in open air for 25 days, all burgers showed little sign of decomposition or rot: Well, well, well. Turns out that not only did the regular McDonald’s burgers not rot, but the home-ground burgers did not rot either. Samples one through five had shrunk a bit (especially the beef patties), but they showed no signs of decomposition. What does this mean? It means that there’s nothing that strange about a McDonald’s burger not rotting. Any burger of the same shape will act the same way. The real question is, why? Serious Eats concluded that the hamburgers didn’t rot or mold because their small size and large surface area allow them to lose moisture quickly. And, without moisture present, decomposition of beef and bun can’t take place. Turns out that McDonald’s has said as much, too. Back in 2014, McDonald’s responded to questions about why its burgers rarely rot in the FAQ section of its website “The reason our food may appear not to decompose comes down to a matter of simple science. In order for decomposition to occur, you need certain conditions — specifically moisture. Without sufficient moisture— either in the food itself or the environment — bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely. So if food is or becomes dry enough, it is unlikely to grow mold or bacteria or decompose. Food prepared at home that is left to dehydrate could see similar results.” So, in conclusion, it’s true that McDonald’s hamburgers won’t rot for years at a time if stored in the right conditions, but the same is true for all hamburgers. Their shape and size allow them to shed moisture quickly, which slows decomposition to a standstill. That’s why we’re calling claims about McDonald’s burgers refusing to rot both true and misleading.","Food - Drink"
"Supermarkets Treat Meat with Carbon Monoxide-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-01-13 12:11:33","https://www.truthorfiction.com/supermarkets-treat-meat-with-carbon-monoxide/"," Supermarkets are sealing meat in airtight packages treated with carbon monoxide to help meat keep its bright red color for weeks. "," It’s true that supermarkets and food processors regularly package meat (and many more foods) with carbon monoxide to preserve the product’s freshness and color. But related claims that carbon monoxide in meat packaging allows products to be sold when they’re no longer fresh, and that packages aren’t clearly labeled, are false. Rumors about supermarkets treating meat with carbon monoxide started circulating in 2006, which happens to be around the time that meat processors and supermarkets began using what’s referred to as modified atmosphere packaging, or MAP. The American Meat Institute says that packaging meat with carbon monoxide has been in use in the U.S. since 2006, and in Norway since about 1986, with no ill effects. Carbon monoxide added to the meat package eliminates oxygen, which leads to oxidation and loss of color in foods like meat and produce: Red meat products are somewhat like sliced apples. Their color can change rapidly — even though the product is still safe and wholesome. In fact, retail stores oft en discount red meat products that have changed color but are still safe and wholesome — and well within their shelf life. These detrimental effects to foods, including apples and meat, are the result of chemical changes caused by oxygen. But by eliminating the oxygen from the package and adding minute amounts of carbon monoxide along with other protective gases to the headspace of the red meat packages, products like ground beef can maintain their appealing red color throughout their shelf life. The FDA has classified carbon monoxide in food packaging systems as “generally recognized as safe.” The agency said that these MAP systems used to package meat often contain a mix of gases: carbon monoxide (0.4%), carbon dioxide (30%) and nitrogen (70%): FSIS has no further questions regarding the suitability of the use of carbon monoxide, at levels up to 0.4 percent, in an inert atmosphere of helium, for treatment of fresh red meat products prior to vacuum packaging for retail. The meat sold using this packaging system must have a “Use by” date of 21 days after, directing the consumer to either use or freeze the contents by that date. In addition, to ensure that consumers are not misled about the freshness of meat treated with carbon monoxide, the statement “color is not an accurate indicator of freshness” is used in conjunction with the “use or freeze by date.” So, it’s true that supermarkets package meat with small amounts of carbon monoxide to retain the product’s color for longer. But it’s not true that it allows products to be sold when they’re no longer fresh (the sell by date was unchanged) and that the packages aren’t clearly labeled (packages say “color is not an accurate indicator of freshness), so this one is misleading, too.

"Warnings About Expired Cake Mix-Truth! & Misleading!","2016-01-13 11:37:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/warnings-about-expired-cake-mix/"," A new version of an old Internet legend that expired cake mix can be fatal has been making its way into email inboxes. "," Expired cake mixes can be fatal for those who have allergies to mold or penicillin, but the dangers of expired cake mix have been greatly exaggerated in these warnings. Warning about expired cake mixes have been in circulation for more than a decade. Most often, a chain email urges people to rush home and throw out every box of cake mix that has passed its expiration date because it could be toxic, and even deadly. Then the email cites an example of a young man or boy who died or nearly died after eating moldy, expired pancake mix. A version of the cake mix warning making the rounds in early 2015 told the story of a high school student whose mother made him pancakes before dropping him off at school. A short time later he allegedly had trouble breathing and nearly died as paramedics rushed him to the hospital. Due to lack of details — like the name of the high school or student — we couldn’t verify the details in that story. TruthorFiction.com investigated another account of expired pancake mix nearly leading to the death of a 14-year-old boy that appeared in an April 2006 “Dear Abby” column. We weren’t able to verify the authenticity of that story, either, but the details are almost exactly the same. Still, there’s at least one verifiable account of a 19-year-old man dying from an allergic reaction after eating an expired box of pancake mix. That account was published in the American Journal of Forensic Medical Pathology in 2001: One morning, he and his friends made pancakes with a packaged mix that had been opened and in the cabinet for approximately 2 years. The friends stopped eating the pancakes because they said that they tasted like “rubbing alcohol.” The decedent continued to eat the pancakes and suddenly became short of breath. He was taken to a nearby clinic, where he became unresponsive and died. At autopsy, laryngeal edema and hyperinflated lungs with mucous plugging were identified. Microscopically, edema and numerous degranulating mast cells were identified in the larynx. The smaller airways contained mucus, and findings of chronic asthma were noted. Serum tryptase was elevated at 14.0 ng/ml. The pancake mix was analyzed and found to contain a total mold count of 700/g of mix as follows: Penicillium, Fusarium, Mucor, and Aspergillus. Witness statements indicate that the decedent ate two pancakes; thus he consumed an approximate mold count of 21,000. The decedent had a history of allergies to molds and penicillin, and thus was allergic to the molds in the pancake mix. The authors present this unusual case of anaphylaxis and a review of the literature. Pathologists who wrote the article called the man’s death an “unusual case of anaphylaxis.” But still, there has been at least one death from exposure to mold in an expired cake mix. Duncan Hines, the maker of various box mixes, has responded directly to the cake mix warning: Due to consumer inquiries regarding mold developing in expired mixes, we would like to assure you that there is no concern with products manufactured by Pinnacle Foods Group LLC. We place a “BEST BY” date on the packaging to ensure product quality in terms of appearance, texture and taste of the finished item. There is no food safety concern in using Duncan Hines cake mixes beyond their “BEST BY” dates. We do recommend that Duncan Hines® products be kept in a cool, dry place. In general, protecting mixes from moisture will prevent mold growth. The Gourmet Sleuth suggests storing boxed cake mix at pantry temperature for no more than six to nine months. After that point, the cake mix should be frozen or thrown out. So, it’s true that mold found in expired cake mixes can be toxic and even fatal for those with extreme allergies to mold. However, the cake mix warning is also misleading because it exaggerates the risk that expired cake mix poses. ","Food - Drink"
"Eating Carrots Improves Your Vision-Truth! & Fiction!","2016-01-06 11:03:59","https://www.truthorfiction.com/eating-carrots-improves-your-vision/"," Some are questioning the old adage that eating carrots improves your vision. "," Eating carrots can help improve vision in certain conditions, but the effect of carrots on eyesight has been exaggerated for decades. The reason carrots have been given too much credit for improving vision is rooted in World War II. Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) began using on-board Airborne Inception Radar (IA) to shoot down German planes over London during night in 1940. Because the radar technology was a secret, the Ministry told newspapers that RAF fighter pilots were so precise at night because they ate carrots, which supposedly improved their night vision, the Smithsonian magazine reports : Whether or not the Germans bought it, the British public generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better during the citywide blackouts. Advertisements with the slogan “Carrots keep you healthy and help you see in the blackout”  (like the one pictured below) appeared everywhere. So, the RAF essentially fibbed that carrots were behind its pilot’s nighttime accuracy, and the public ate it up. At some point, it became generally accepted that carrots improve overall vision — not just night vision — and that’s been repeated at countless dinner tables around the world. When it comes to night vision, Emily Chew, the deputy clinical director at the National Eye Institute, backs up the claim that carrots can help. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which the body uses to make vitamin A. Vitamin A helps the eye convert light into a signal that’s transmitted to the brain, which can help improve vision nighttime vision, Chew told Scientific American magazine: But exactly how many carrots would be needed to optimize night vision remains less clear. Most studies have so far looked at the benefits of beta-carotene or vitamin A supplements, not carrots specifically. One randomized control study in 2005 examined how consumption of roughly 4.5 ounces of cooked carrots six days a week stacked up against other vitamin A–rich options such as fortified rice, amaranth leaf and goat liver for helping address night blindness in pregnant women. The result: all the foods performed roughly the same, although the vitamin A supplement did best of all. The study found that a regular diet of the cooked carrots for six weeks helped to bring women’s response to darkness to normal levels. (In Western nations about 30 percent of dietary vitamin A comes from beta-carotene but in some developing countries it is the sole source of vitamin A.) When it comes to improving overall vision and eye health,  however, the answer is a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, not carrots alone, according to the National Eye Institute : You’ve heard carrots are good for your eyes. But eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, particularly dark leafy greens such as spinach, kale, or collard greens is important for keeping your eyes healthy, too.i Research has also shown there are eye health benefits from eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut. But, when it comes to using carrots or any other foods to improve your eyesight, don’t expect too much. Research has found that the body protects itself against excessive amounts of vitamin A because it can become toxic at high levels. So, if you eat nothing but carrots in hopes of gaining 20/20 vision, your body will be working against you the entire time. In conclusion, carrots can improve vision in certain conditions (i.e. at night), and they’re good for overall eye health. Just don’t believe reports that eating carrots (or any other vitamin A rich food) will improve your overall vision. ","Food - Drink"

"Burger King Uses Horse Meat-Fiction!","2015-12-03 13:02:45","https://www.truthorfiction.com/burger-king-uses-horse-meat/"," Rumors have gone viral that Burger King adds horsemeat to its burgers. "," Add Burger King to the long list of fast food chains accused of using horsemeat, but that’s an outdated and false claim. One of Burger King’s European meat suppliers was linked to burger patties tainted with horse DNA back in 2012, but tests revealed that Burger King’s meat supply wasn’t affected. Those old horsemeat rumors were drudged up in September 2015 by the fake news website Before It’s News in a story headlined , “Burger King Admits Burgers Contain Horsemeat.” The 2015 report made it appear that the three-year-old Burger King horsemeat controversy was just unfolding, but that’s not the case. Back in 2012, one of the Burger King’s European suppliers, Silvercrest, was caught producing burgers tainted with horse DNA. It became known across Europe as the “horsemeat scandal of 2013.” But no horsemeat was found in Burger King products. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland announced in early 2013 that hamburger patties produced at a Silvercrest plant in Ireland contained tace amounts of horse DNA, according to a report : Of the 27 burger products analysed, all were positive for bovine DNA, 23 (85%) were positive for porcine DNA and 10 (37%) were positive for equine DNA. Most of the burgers positive for porcine DNA were not labelled as containing pork which was found at very low levels and again we considered its presence may be unintentional and due to cross-over during the processing of different animal species in the same plant. The 27 burgers which were tested in this study came from nine different manufacturers, six in Ireland and three in the UK. The products which tested positive for equine DNA came from three plants, two in Ireland and one in the UK. A surprising result was the detection of equine DNA in 10 beef burgers which were not labelled as containing horse meat. Given this unexpected finding, we decided that these results needed to be confirmed and the laboratory was requested to sequence the DNA detected to ensure that it was of equine and porcine origin. This was confirmed by the laboratory on 10th December. Silvercrest was one of the nine manufacturers that tested positive for horsemeat. The producer was shut down, and the company recalled 10 million burgers from supermarkets in the U.K. and Ireland. At the time, it was widely reported that Silvercrest was a Burger King supplier, which led to speculation that burgers sold at Burger King were tainted with horsemeat. Burger King quickly announced that it had dropped Silvercrest as a supplier as a “precautionary measure.” The false Before It’s News report linked to an article published by The Guardian in January 2013. That report was (incorrectly) headlined, “Burger King reveals its burgers were contaminated in horsemeat scandal.” The headline contradicts what’s reported in the story, however. Burger King said trace amounts of horse DNA had been found at its supplier’s plant — but it said no horse DNA had been found in its burgers. Then, Burger King released a statement in February 2013 that said it had conducted tests that definitively showed no horse meat burgers had been delivered to its restaurants. The burger chain did acknowledge, however, that its independent testing had found horse DNA at the processing plant : “While the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has stated that this is not a food safety issue, we are deeply troubled by the findings of our investigation and apologise to our guests, who trust us to source only the highest quality 100 percent beef burgers. Our supplier has failed us and in turn we have failed you. We are committed to ensuring that this does not happen again.” So, Burger King never used horsemeat in its burgers. A European supplier of Burger King was found to have supplied grocery stores — not Burger King — with burger patties that had horse DNA in them. Still, those rumors persist today. ","Food - Drink"
"Dick Smith Warns of Halal Certification Extortion-Fiction!","2015-12-02 14:06:17","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dick-smith-warns-of-halal-certification-extortion/"," Emails and social media posts claim that Dick Smith, the owner of the Dick Smith Foods franchise in Australia, warns that halal certification amounts to extortion by the Islamic Council of Australia. "," Dick Smith has not warned that halal certification is extortion. A series of forwarded emails and social media posts called “A Warning from Dick Smith” that first surfaced online in 2014. The emails and posts claimed that Dick Smith warned that the Islamic Council of Australia was extorting businesses by charging fees to use the halal logo on food labels, but that’s not true. Dick Smith Foods, an Aussie grocery chain, posted a statement on its website back in 2014 that explained its stance on halal certification. The company said it had decided not to pursue halal certification because of extra inspections and costs associated with it, not because it was extortion: We have received a number of letters from people asking if we will be putting the Muslim Halal logo on our food. To acquire Halal certification, payment is required to the endorsing body and involves a number of site inspections of both our growers and processors in order to ensure that our practices comply with the conditions of Halal certification. It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold – it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith. We are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don’t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed. Shortly after the Aussie grocery chain posted the message (which appears in its entirety above), someone added statements to make it appear that Dick Smith Foods warned that halal certification was extortion. Here are the parts that were falsely added to the original statement: We point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organisation for the right to do so. Others would add that money paid to ANY Muslim ‘organisation’ (and you had better believe it: these people ARE ‘organised’) can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary. What other assurances do we accept from Muslims? Oh, that’s right, ‘Islam is a religion of PEACE’! How less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?” This is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Aus/NZ are bullying large commercial organisations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organisations (Cadbury/ Schweppes/ Nestles/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats. Of course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury’s chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam. The Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference – but give them time. Several state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department’s current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England. After the false Dick Smith warning went viral, Dick Smith released a statement clarifying that “hoax” social media posts and emails had misrepresented the company’s views on halal certification: Please be aware that there is a hoax email being distributed on social media networks. It has been circulating for some time now and although most people are aware that it is hoax. There are others who believe it to be true and keep sharing it. Our view on Halal certification is as stated above only. Please help us put a stop to this hoax by advising anyone who shares it that it is not Dick Smith’s view on the subject. Thank you. TruthorFiction.com previously investigated rumors about Australian food companies using Halal certification .We found a claim that said anyone who buys halal certified foods supports terrorism to be false. Companies that choose to label certified halal products typically pay an annual licensing fee to use the certification logo, an ABC affiliate in Australia reports : Processed food companies, who generally pay a set yearly fee for halal certification, were more willing to talk, but few would disclose exactly what this costs. The Byron Bay Cookie Company said its annual halal certification fee was around $1,500 a year. This represented about 0.003 per cent of its total cost of doing business, a spokesman told Fact Check. Geoff Hutchinson, a director of the Fleurieu Milk Company, which forfeited a $50,000 contract to supply yoghurt to Emirates airlines after a sustained anti-halal social media campaign, says halal certification for the contract cost about $1,000, or two per cent of the contract. A spokeswoman for Nestle said the fees the company paid were negligible in the context of its total business. “They do not influence the price at which we sell our products. We don’t pass this cost on,” she said. The point of Dick Smith’s initial message about halal certification was that the company couldn’t pursue it without passing large costs along to its consumers. So, the company’s decision not to pursue certification was not a stand against the so-called “extortion” of halal certification, as the rumor claims. ","Food - Drink"

The video appeared on a YouTube channel called JunkinVideo, which curates viral videos from across the web: The YouTube channel doesn’t usually post fake videos, so many people were tricked into believing that the helium infused wine video was real when it appeared there. This isn’t the first time that helium infused beverage hoaxes have appeared. The most popular one was done by Samuel Adams as an April Fool’s Day prank in 2014. The founder of Samuel Adams talked about the brewery’s new helium infused beer before taking a sip and talking in a high voice — an April Fool’s Day joke that was lost on many, as we previously reported . Since then, imitators have posted videos about helium infused wine, helium infused beer and even helium infused water. Don’t believe any of them. As it turns out, helium would make a bad addition to any beverage. Helium is 700 times less soluble than carbon dioxide, which is used to carbonate beer and other beverages, so it would form one of two big gas bubbles instead of the slow fizz that you’d expect. Also, the helium would immediately escape when the container was opened, along with a lot of water, causing a big mess, according to Science Everyday . ","Food - Drink"

On November 3, 2015, Chipotle announced that it would temporarily close 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington because of an “E. coli incident.” A total of 39 people in the Pacific Northwest had been hospitalized after being exposed to E. coli while dining at Chipotle, a local ABC News affiliate in Washington State reported . A week later, on November 10, Chipotle announced that it had concluded an investigation into the E. coli outbreak and reopened all 43 restaurants in Washington and Oregon. Meat served at 11 of the restaurants tested positive for E. coli. The company said that no known cases had been reported at restaurants outside of the Pacific Northwest. In the meantime, false reports that Chipotle was closing all of its restaurants because of E. coli contamination, or because it had been discovered that Chipotle serves dog and cat meat, swept across the Internet. The fake news website Huzlers was behind a false report that Chipotle had closed 60 restaurants because of an E. coli outbreak related to Chipotle’s use of dog and cat meat: It is being reported that the popular restaurant chain ‘Chipotle Mexican Grill’, more commonly known as simply ‘Chipotle’, is currently being investigated for allegedly using dog and cat meat in their dishes causing the E. coli outbreak. The FDA suspected the chain was using dog and cat meat when an FDA inspector stumbled upon multiple live dogs and cat, as well as dog and cat corpses in one Chipotle factory located in Denver. The inspector notified the authorities and the factory was shut down. The FDA will soon force all Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. to prevent people from consuming dog and cat meat. That story tricked many people into believing that Chipotle actually used dog and cat meat, but Huzlers is “the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website in the world,” according to a disclaimer on its homepage. The website FeedNewz.com also “pranked” more than 8 million people with false report headlined, “Chipotle announced all stores will be closed by March 2016.” Once you click on the link, however, your taken to a page that says, “You got owned!” So, it’s true that Chipotle temporarily closed a number of restaurants to investigate an E. coli outbreak.

"Beware of Bananas Injected with HIV Blood-Fiction!","2015-11-10 14:11:55","https://www.truthorfiction.com/beware-of-bananas-injected-with-hiv-blood/"," Bananas purchased at Walmart and other stores in the U.S. have been injected with HIV blood. "," Don’t worry about reports about bananas injected with HIV. Reports of HIV bananas that were bought at supermarkets in the U.S. began popping up on social media sites in the fall of 2015. One such report claimed that a bunch of bananas purchased in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was injected with HIV infected blood. In another post, a writer claimed that she had purchased HIV-laced bananas at a Walmart in Aberdeen, Washington: I bought a bundle of bananas from the Walmart in Aberdeen tonight and opened it to give my 2 yr old daughter. This is what I found on the inside! I opened the rest of the bundle and they appeared to be normal bananas. I’m not saying it’s blood but what else could it be! Turns out that red spots in bananas could be a lot of things. Things like disease, fungus and insects have all been known to cause red spots in bananas. There have been no known cases of HIV being injected into bananas, however. That claim is similar to a rumor that went viral in early 2015 that blood oranges from Libya are being injected with HIV blood (also false). Even if these accounts were true, it would be nearly impossible to contract HIV from eating an orange that was injected with infected blood before it was shipped over a long distance. HIV is a living virus, and it needs a human host to survive, the non-profit group Aid for AIDS reports : “HIV is a very fragile virus outside of the body. The HIV virus needs the human body as its host. The life span of HIV outside of the body has not been determined. However, we know that HIV needs its host cell (a human), the body temperature, and the chemistry of the blood to survive. Out of the body, HIV is out of its environment. As the blood dries, the HIV will die. In areas like a syringe or on a razor in a medicine cabinet, HIV would probably live longer because of less airflow and it’s a more moist temperature controlled area. “Just remember, outside of the body HIV can’t survive. In minutes it will die and be harmless, but Universal Precautions should always be used.” And, when it comes to bananas, studies have shown that they have high levels of a naturally occurring chemical called lectin that can actually help prevent the transmission of HIV: The study showed a lectin called BanLec was as potent as two HIV drugs, T-20 and maraviroc, that are currently being used to treat HIV. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins found in plants that can identify and attach to foreign invaders, and subsequently blocks HIV’s entry into the body. Michael E. Swanson, study author and doctoral student in the graduate program in immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School said “The problem with some HIV drugs is that the virus can mutate and become resistant, but that’s much harder to do in the presence of lectins.” So, not only does HIV not survive long enough outside the human body to transmit the virus via fruit, bananas have a natural chemical that has actually been found to prevent the transmission of HIV. That means this rumor is a hoax. ","Food - Drink"
"Jesus Has Been Removed from Starbucks Christmas Cups, Sparking a War on Christmas-Mostly Fiction!","2015-11-09 07:51:34","https://www.truthorfiction.com/jesus-removed-from-starbucks-christmas-cups-sparking-a-war-on-christmas/"," Jesus and other Christian symbols have been removed from 2015 Starbucks Christmas cups. "," Starbucks Christmas cups have never featured Jesus or other religious symbols, so the idea that they have been “removed” this year is false. The 2015 Starbucks Christmas cup was unveiled in October. The cup features a “two-toned ombre design, with a bright poppy color on top that shades intoa darker cranberry below, the company said on its website: Since 1997 Starbucks has served its holiday beverages in a unique cup, starting with a jazz-themed design in jewel tones of deeper reds, greens and blues. Every year since, the cup has told a story of the holidays by featuring symbols of the season from vintage ornaments and hand-drawn reindeer to modern vector-illustrated characters. “In the past, we have told stories with our holiday cups designs,” said Fields. “This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.” In the nearly two decades since the first red Starbucks cup, the company has grown from 1,400 stores in a handful of countries to more than 22,000 stores in 68 markets around the world. “Starbucks has become a place of sanctuary during the holidays,” he said. “We’re embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it. It’s more open way to usher in the holiday.” Since the Starbucks Christmas cup was released in 1997, it has never featured religious symbols . The fist year of Starbucks Christmas cup featured a seasonal jazz scene. Another early design featured hand-drawn reindeer. More recently, in 2009, the Starbucks Christmas cup featured pine needles and general words printed on ornaments like “wish” and “hope.“ In 2010, the Starbucks Christmas cup featured carolers. In 2011, Starbucks Christmas cups featured a boy and dog sledding down a hill. In 2014, the Starbucks Christmas cup was strikingly similar to this year’s all-red cup, but it also had abstract brush strokes in the background. So, the idea that Jesus and other Christian symbols have been “removed” from Starbucks Christmas cups this year aren’t true because religous symbols have never been featured on Starbucks Christmas cups. Rumors that Jesus and Christian symbols had been removed from Starbucks Christmas cups this year were started by a viral video posted by a former pastor named Joshua Feuerstein. Holding up the two-toned red Starbucks Christmas cup, Feuerstein said that Jesus had been removed from this year’s Starbucks Christmas cups and encouraged customers to tell baristas their name is “Merry Christmas” to trick them into writing it on the Starbucks Christmas cups: “Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups? That’s why they’re just plain red. In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn’t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers? …And guess what. Starbucks, I tricked you into putting Merry Christmas on your cup. And I’m challenging all great Americans and Christians around this great nation: Go into Starbucks and take your own coffee selfie.” In response, Starbucks said its 2015 Christmas cups are intended to be a “blank canvas” that encourages “customers to tell their Christmas stories in their own way.” So, it’s true that Starbucks Christmas cups don’t say “Merry Christmas,” or feature any Christian references, but that’s not a new development. The company hasn’t featured Christian symbols on its Christmas cups since they were first unveiled in 1997. ","Food - Drink"

"," Human DNA was found in about 2% of hot dogs that were analyzed in one study, but that doesn’t mean people who eat them are cannibals. Clear Labs, a nonprofit group that analyzes food at the molecular level, undertook a “ Hot Dog Study ” that looked at 345 hotdog and sausage samples marketed under 75 different brands and sold at 10 different retailers: Each sample we analyze is assigned a Clear Score. The Clear Score is a representation of how closely a product’s label claims match its actual molecular contents. The higher the score, the more closely a product abides by its claims. To create the score, each item is molecularly analyzed through our proprietary DNA sequencing workflow. We screen for major, medium, and minor substitution, and we deduct points accordingly. We then examine products for nutrition-content accuracy, such as carbs, fat, calories, and protein. The Hot Dog study found human DNA samples in 2% of the 345 hotdogs and sausages that it looked at. Two-thirds of that human DNA was found in vegetarian hot dogs, according to the study. Overall, 14.4% of the hotdogs and sausages that were tested were listed as “problematic” because of substituted or unexpected ingredients or hygienic issues. Human DNA found in hotdogs was classified as a hygienic issue because human hair or skin dander likely got into the product during the manufacturing process. So, it’s true that human DNA was found in hotdog samples — but that doesn’t mean that people who eat hot dogs are cannibals. The FDA allows many “defects” in processed foods that most people would find even more disgusting than human DNA. Things like maggots, rodent hair, feces, cigarette butts and mold are allowed in processed foods at allowable levels because, the FDA reports : The FDA set these action levels because it is economically impractical to grow, harvest, or process raw products that are totally free of non-hazardous, naturally occurring, unavoidable defects. Products harmful to consumers are subject to regulatory action whether or not they exceed the action levels. Because hot dogs don’t appear on the FDA’s list of product defects, the agency would likely decide what action needs to be taken on a “case-by-case basis” if it confirmed the report’s findings.

"," Claims that leftover onions are magnets for bacteria and should never be eaten are mostly fictional. That rumor first surfaced in a 2008 blog post that appeared at the website DinnerWithZola.com. The blog, headlined “Watch out for those spoiled onions,” reported that cut or leftover onions are magnets for bacteria and are among the most common causes of food poisoning: …Onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion. (A food expert) says it’s not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator. It’s already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!) The National Onion Association took exception to that claim. The trade group argued that the opposite is true: juices released from cut onions kill and inhibit the growth of some microorganisms that can cause illness: When cut, onions release compounds that do not promote pathogen growth. This is the same compound that causes our eyes to produce tears. When handled properly, cut onions can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 7 days. Uncut onions, meanwhile, should be stored in a dark, dry and well-ventilated place. It’s always important to make sure that you store onions and potatoes separately, too, because they can make each other spoil faster, according to the Penn State Extension : Avoid storing onions near potatoes; onions will absorb the potato’s moisture and spoil from exposure to the potato’s gas. Also avoid storing onions where they will be exposed to moisture. So, it’s true when not properly stored after they’re cut, onions can become magnets for bacteria. The claims that all onions are poisonous and should not be eaten within a day or two of being cut is false. ","Food - Drink"

At that time, it was rumored that Dew, an unregistered bottled water that contained a poison, had made its way into marketplaces in Nigeria by way of Tanzania and had killed 180 people. The National Agency for Food Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of Nigeria said it had investigated those claims and found that they were “false and mischievous.” Still, Nigeria doesn’t allow bottled water to be imported into the country, and DEW is not among the country’s registered bottled waters, so consumers were urged to alert authorities if they saw DEW bottled water being sold in marketplaces, Modern Ghana reports : The Food and Drugs Board (FDB) has therefore advised the public to report any person who offered DEW bottled water for sale. According to a statement issued by the FDB in Accra and copied to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), the board had not registered any brand of bottled water with the name DEW. The statement, signed by the Chief Executive of the FDB, Dr Stephen K. Opuni, said rumours had suggested that the DEW bottled water had been imported from Tanzania into Nigeria and was alleged to contain a chemical that had caused the death of 180 people in that country. It said the FDB established that the rumour was false, after investigations it conducted, including post-market surveillance activities and contacts with the NAFDAC of Nigeria and the Tanzanian Bureau of Standards.

"," Burger King’s Halloween Whopper hasn’t turned customers’ skin black, but it has gained attention for reportedly turning something else green. First, the false report that the Halloween Whopper has turned customer’s skin black was started by the fake news website Huzlers . The (fake) story reported that Burger King’s Halloween Whopper, which features a black bun, had turned customers “from Caucasian to Black”: The FDA decided to open an urgen investigation on the Halloween Whopper and made a shocking discovery. The FDA discovered that the Whopper is not dyed black with ordinary food coloring as Burger King announced, but rather dyed with extremely high amounts of black ink, enough to turn your skin black within a few days. Experts say ordinary food coloring could not turn the bread black as Burger King wanted, so they proceeded to use black ink. “It’s like getting a huge tattoo,” says Dr. Esteban Greizman. Within days, the story had been shared more than 13,000 times on social media sites. Taken out of context, many users were duped into believing that the story was at least partially true. Huzlers , however, isn’t a trustworthy news source, according to its Terms and Conditions page . The Halloween Whopper has (reportedly) had a different expected side effect, however: green poop. Many customers have taken to social media to report the black bun’s unusual side effect using #greenpoop. Burger King launched the Halloween Whopper in Japan in 2014 with great success, but the burger chain explained to ABC News that it had used a different method to dye the buns black in the U.S.: The burger was first introduced in Japan last year. The black bun offered in Japan reportedly got its black hue from bamboo charcoal. The American version will not feature bamboo charcoal. The dark color in the U.S. sandwich comes from the “smoky black pepper flavor of A.1. baked into the bun,” a Burger King spokesman told ABC News, adding that the bun also contains less than one percent of food dye. The “Halloween Whopper” clocks in at 710 calories and 43 grams of fat, according to Burger King’s nutritional info. This special edition burger is actually healthier than the regular Whopper with cheese (730 calories and 44 grams of fat). The company hasn’t commented on reports of the Halloween Whopper’s side effect, but some have commented that green food coloring is often used to dye foods black. ","Food - Drink"
"Nabisco Is Moving to Mexico-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-09-29 17:01:27","https://www.truthorfiction.com/nabisco-is-moving-to-mexico/"," Nabisco is moving to Mexico. "," Nabisco has moved about 600 jobs from the U.S. to Mexico, but the company still produces snacks in the U.S., too. Mondelez International (Nabisco’s parent company) has announced that half of the 1,200 jobs at a Nabisco bakery in Chicago would be sent to new production lines in Mexico in 2016: The company decided not to make a $130 million upgrade to the facility, the company’s largest U.S. bakery, which dates to the 1950s, because the three unions that represent workers either did not make a proposal to keep the work or their concession packages were inadequate, said Laurie Guzzinati, a Mondelez spokeswoman. The layoffs at the plant, at 7300 S. Kedzie Ave., will occur over the next year. The facility makes BelVita, Mini Chips Ahoy and Cheese Nips, among other products, and those will continue to be made in Chicago on seven production lines that will be upgraded. Nine other lines will shut down, and that work will be transferred to four state-of-the-art production lines in Salinas, Mexico. In July, Mondelez Interntional told investors that it had completed a $130 million investment in the production line in Salinas, Mexico. The investment was for “four state-of-the-art manufacturing lines” that will be used to make Oreo Cookies: Today’s announcement follows a process that began in early April, involving discussions with employees’ union representatives from the Chicago plant as well as company due diligence to select between Salinas and Chicago, the two locations which were considered for this investment. “The Chicago plant has been and will continue to be an important part of the company’s North American biscuit footprint, producing a variety of beloved consumer products,” said Olivier Bouret, Vice President, North America Integrated Supply Chain, Biscuits. “While the new investment will affect approximately 600 positions in Chicago, we’re committed to treating all impacted employees fairly through this difficult time.” The Chicago plant will continue to be one of Mondelez International’s largest North American manufacturing facilities in terms of headcount, and the company plans to continue to invest in capabilities, technologies and infrastructure upgrades at this facility. The company also noted that it had made $170 million in recent investments at manufacturing plants around the U.S. So, it’s true that Nabisco has moved hundreds of jobs to Mexico — but the Nabisco division as a whole has not moved to Mexico.

"Claims about Cadbury, Other Certified Halal Products Sold in Australia-Truth! & Fiction!","2015-09-25 10:56:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/claims-about-cadbury-other-certified-halal-products-sold-in-australia/"," A forwarded email claims that Cadbury products are labeled certified halal, and a portion of sales go to Muslim organizations that support terrorism. "," Some Cadbury (and many other) products are labeled as certified halal, but claims that those who buy the products are supporting terrorism are false. The forwarded email first surfaced in 2009. A consumer in Australia who found a halal certification symbol “hidden” on a Cadbury product’s packaging wrote the email: I checked out Cadbury today at Woolworths!!! No more Cadbury’s for me!!! I will check everything from now on… It is also on my Bega Cheese. This is absolute fact. Before Lorraine went shopping Monday I showed her this email. She looked at the products in the shop mentioned and they had the symbol hidden on the back of the packaging and in a very weak colour that was hard to see… That claim is true, but it’s misleading to suggest that the company has “hidden” the fact that some of its products are certified halal. Cadbury lists more than 75 products as certified halal on its website. Then the forwarded email goes on to suggest that Cadbury pays the Halal Certification Authority for use of the certified halal symbol, and that the money “may” be used to support terrorism: This is a Muslim Association that collects money from the Australian Food Industry for this symbol so that Muslims will purchase the product. Yet we are told the Muslim population are only one and a half percent of Australia’s total! On a recent radio talk-back show a well known host was alerted to this practice. He hit a stone wall when trying to find out HOW MUCH money was paid to this organization and WHERE the money went. That claim mirrors a larger movement against certified halal products that has been taking place in Australia in recent years. Social media campaigns have called for the boycott of companies that produce certified halal products, and a Change.org petition to “ban the forced halal certification being imposed on all Australians.” There are a number of problems with these claims. First, halal certification is not “being imposed on all Australians.” Individual companies decide whether or not to make halal products, and whether or not to get third-party groups to certify halal product claims, according to the Australian Food and Grocery Council : It is up to the manufacturer whether or not to make a halal claim for a particular product. A manufacturer can also claim that a food is halal without the claim needing to be certified (the Australian Consumer Law prohibits any false, misleading or deceptive claims). Certification simply provides third party assurance that the claim is valid. It is up to manufacturers to decide whether the marketing benefits of certification outweigh the costs. The forwarded email also claims that companies are catering to Muslims even though they make up less than 2% of the country’s population. However, the Halal Certification Authority allows companies to label certified halal products for sale in Australia, the Americas, Asia and Europe. Overall, the certification allows companies to reach “one fifth of the Muslim population worldwide,” so the market extends well beyond Australia. Companies that do choose to label certified halal products typically pay an annual licensing fee to use the certification logo, an ABC affiliate in Australia reports : Processed food companies, who generally pay a set yearly fee for halal certification, were more willing to talk, but few would disclose exactly what this costs. The Byron Bay Cookie Company said its annual halal certification fee was around $1,500 a year. This represented about 0.003 per cent of its total cost of doing business, a spokesman told Fact Check. Geoff Hutchinson, a director of the Fleurieu Milk Company, which forfeited a $50,000 contract to supply yoghurt to Emirates airlines after a sustained anti-halal social media campaign, says halal certification for the contract cost about $1,000, or two per cent of the contract. A spokeswoman for Nestle said the fees the company paid were negligible in the context of its total business. “They do not influence the price at which we sell our products. We don’t pass this cost on,” she said. And authorities in Australia have investigated claims that licensing fees for certified halal product logos have been used to support terrorism, and no proof has been found, the Australian Crime Commission reports : The Australian Crime Commission-led Eligo National Task Force is focused on the use of the alternative money remittance sector and other informal value transfer systems (IVTS) by serious and organised crime. The task force has identified direct links between serious and organised crime, money laundering and terrorism funding. However, the Australian Crime Commission is not aware of any direct links between the legitimate halal certification industry and money laundering or the financing of terrorist groups. Anyone with information about money laundering or the financing of terrorist activity is encouraged to contact the Australian Crime Commission or the National Security Hotline on 1800 1234 00. Finally, arguments against halal certification labeling often center on the idea that companies produce halal products to be politically correct, or to please a small minority of Muslim customers. That’s not the case. Companies produce halal products because of market forces. The global halal food market is expected to be worth $3.9 trillion by 2019 , and companies want to tap into that market. ","Food - Drink"

Samuel Adams “introduced” a new helium beer called HeliYUM in a video released on April Fools Day 2014. The company’s brewmaster said, “Infusing beer with helium has an amazing impact on the beer. Couple this with a lighter mouthfeel, and you’ve got a beer unlike any you’ve ever tasted.” Then, of course, after he took a drink of helium beer his voice was high pitched like he’d just sucked in helium. A lot of people missed the punch line, because rumors about the new helium beer were still circulating more than a year after the video was released. The joke got recycled for April Fools Day 2015, too. Berkshire Brewing Company pulled the same gag when it released a video introducing its “new” helium beer, Helium IPA, a day before April Fools Day. There have also been reports about others who are trying to make helium beer, but don’t believe any of them. The website Science Everyday looked into the possibility of helium beer — and the outlook isn’t good. First, helium is 700 times less soluble in water than carbon dioxide, so undissolved helium would form one or two big gas bubbles, not the trademark “slow fizz” of beer. Second, all the helium sealed inside the beer can would immediately escape (along with a lot of water) immediately when the seal was broken, and it would make a big mess. ","Food - Drink"
"Tyson Foods Plans to Cut U.S. Jobs, Import Chicken from China-Fiction!","2015-08-11 10:19:52","https://www.truthorfiction.com/tyson-foods-plans-to-cut-u-s-jobs-import-chicken-from-china/"," Rumors have run rampant on social media sites that Tyson Foods will cut 75,000 jobs in the U.S. and begin to import processed chicken to the U.S. from facilities in China. "," There’s no proof that Tyson Foods plans import chicken from China to the U.S. That rumor has lit up social media sites and has sparked concerns about the quality of the chicken that Tyson (supposedly) plans to import to the U.S. from China. Many of these claims can be traced back to a USDA initiative to certify Chinese facilities to process U.S.-raised poultry for sale in the U.S. The approval process, which started in 2006, temporarily ground to a halt after Congress voted to defund USDA inspections of Chinese poultry imports, but that didn’t last long, Newsweek reports: Soon China’s certification lapsed, but it appealed to the World Trade Organization, which ruled in 2009 that Congress’s treatment of the country was unfair. Funding was restored and the process of approval began again. A series of USDA audits followed, all of which found China unfit to process U.S. poultry. Then, in 2013, without further inspection, the agency granted four Chinese plants certification. “It seems China is continually getting to the head of the line,” (Tony Corbo, a lobbyist at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch), says. The USDA announced in August 2013 that after “a few minor suggestions” a number of Chinese poultry facilities had been approved to process U.S.-raised chicken that could be sold in the U.S.: As all outstanding issues have been resolved, the PRC may proceed with certifying a list of poultry processing establishments as meeting the FSIS requirements. These certified establishments may then begin exporting processed (heat-treated/cooked) poultry products to the United States under the conditions established in FSIS’ April 2006 final rule; i.e. only processed poultry products produced from poultry slaughtered under FSIS inspection in the United States or in a country eligible to export slaughtered poultry to the United States. So, it’s true that a number of Chinese poultry facilities are certified to process U.S.-raised chicken that could be sold in the U.S. But claims that Tyson plans to cut 75,000 U.S. jobs and to export chicken from China to the U.S. are unfounded. Tyson called the rumor a “hoax” in a company statement : All of the chicken we sell in the U.S. is raised and processed here in the U.S. The posts being shared on social media channels are a hoax. We have no plans to cut jobs or process chicken in China to be returned to the U.S. The rumor appears to have started with reports that Tyson was the only major U.S. chicken processor that lobbied the USDA for “market access for chicken to China” and other countries. But that doesn’t mean Tyson wants to use that market access to export chicken from China to the U.S. The company told Newsweek that its lobbying efforts were actually meant to free up U.S. chicken exports to China: So why did Tyson lobby the USDA? Corporations are not required to disclose in detail their reasons for supporting specific issues, but in an email to Newsweek, Tyson says that the lobbying efforts reported in 2013 were around trade and tariff issues for the export of U.S.-produced products into China and not related to the import of poultry products produced in China. It also sought to have Chinese import bans lifted from two major poultry producing states. There’s speculation that the USDA’s approval of Chinese chicken imports was a bargaining chip to open up food trade between the two countries. Food and Water Watch said China nixed U.S. beef exports in 2003 after a cow in Washington State was diagnosed with mad cow disease. The U.S. was shut out of the beef market despite soaring beef prices there. China also placed high tariffs on chicken imports from the U.S. because it claimed that it was sold below market value, Politico reports : The tariffs cut off 80 percent of U.S. chicken exports to China. The World Trade Organization ruled in July that the tariffs were unjustified. It remains unclear if China will abide by the ruling or appeal. The poultry industry was careful to not express a great deal of enthusiasm in response to Friday’s news. “I’m cautiously optimistic this is good news for our industry,” said Toby Moore, a spokesman for the U.S.A. Poultry and Egg Export Council. That helps explain why Tyson would be motivated to lobby the USDA on trade and tariff issues related to chicken products exported to China. ","Food - Drink"

But, as the story made its way around the Internet, it morphed into a grisly (and false) warning about tongue-eating parasites in tuna. The Nottingham Post first reported in January 2015 that a British woman had found a “creature staring at her” from a can of Princes tuna. The initial Post report quoted a professor who said the creature looked like a “juvenile crab.” Then, in February 2015, the Telegraph reported that scientists had identified the “tiny tuna monster” as a parasite that preys on the tongues of large fish: …The Natural History Museum said that the head probably belonged to a Cymothoa exigua, or tongue-eating louse.

We are constantly serving hot coffee to customers.

Our grease may be derived from pork lard. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. But a photo of the sign reveals that the story is a hoax.

"Aspartame Is Made from GM Bacteria Excrement-Truth! & Misleading!","2015-07-02 18:13:31","https://www.truthorfiction.com/aspartame-is-made-from-gm-bacteria-excrement/"," Rumors have circulated social media sites that aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in soft drinks and food, is made from the feces of genetically modified (GM)  E. coli bacteria. "," A patent that was filed in 1981 describes making aspartame from the excretions of genetically modified bacteria, but the claim that aspartame is made from GM E. coli poop today is misleading. Claims about aspartame being made from GM bacteria poop come from a European patent that was filed in 1981. The patent, which first became available online in 2013, outlines a process to make aspartame from the excretions of genetically modified bacteria, and E. coli bacteria in particular. But the idea that aspartame is made from GM E. coli poop over simplifies the complex process of making aspartame, which has changed steadily over the years. It also ignores the fact that bacteria exists at the cellular level and doesn’t have a digestive system, which means it doesn’t “poop.”  Instead, it excretes unneeded nutrients and byproducts through a cell wall. Aspartame was discovered as a low-calorie sugar substitute for soft drinks and food in the 1960s, and the process used to create it has been evolving ever since. According to Harvard University : The tumultuous history of the food additive aspartame began serendipitously thirty-five years ago. On the day that James M. Schlatter, a chemist, unintentionally discovered it, he was working on an anti-ulcer drug. As Mr. Schlatter mixed asparatic acid and phenylalanine, two naturally occurring amino acids that are the building blocks of protein, he stuck his finger in the mixture and for some reason decided to taste it. I licked my finger and it tasted good. He later recalled. And with that, a new, low-calorie sweetener was born. What has happened since that fateful day in 1965 comprises the additive’s struggle from birth to maturity; not unlike a human being moving from inception to adulthood, aspartame has overcome many hurdles and incited much controversy on its path to a somewhat more stable maturity. James Schlatter quickly filed a patent for the process in 1966. The FDA approved aspartame for use in various products from the 1970s and 1990s. Still, aspartame remains controversial, with many questioning its side effects. The 1981 European patent states that Schlatter’s peptide synthesis process was too costly and time-consuming. A “new” method described in the patent detailed “the introduction of foreign genetic material into microorganisms which then produce the protein or proteins for which such foreign genetic material codes.” The U.K.-based Independent reports that GM was needed to make the bacteria produce more phenylalanine, one of the two amino acids used to make aspartame: As the G8 summit of rich country leaders decided last night to launch an inquiry into the safety of genetically modified (GM) food, an investigation by the Independent on Sunday revealed that Monsanto, the pioneering GM food giant which makes aspartame, often uses genetically engineered bacteria to produce the sweetener at its US production plants. “We have two strains of bacteria — one is traditionally modified and one is genetically modified,” said one Monsanto source. “It’s got a modified enzyme. It has one amino acid different.” The use of genetic engineering to make aspartame has stayed secret until now because there is no modified DNA in the finished product. Monsanto insists that it is completely safe. A Monsanto spokeswoman confirmed that aspartame for the US market is made using genetic engineering. But sweetener supplied to British food producers is not. However, consumer groups say it is likely that some low-calorie products containing genetically engineered aspartame have been imported into Britain. That report was from 1999, and Monsanto sold its NutraSweet division (a brand name for aspartame) in 2000 and has not produced it since. Today, it’s generally accepted that aspartame is made using GM bacteria, but it’s not clear that it’s E. coli bacteria. Companies are notoriously tight-lipped about how they make food products, so there’s no way to know if some, all or none of the 1981 patent is still in use. We have reported this one as truth and misleading because it’s true that patent was filed to produce aspartame from the excretions of GMO bacteria, but the eRumor oversimplifies a complex process and assumes that the process hasn’t changed at all since 1981.

"A Dog Meat Festival is Held Each Year in Yulin, China-Truth!","2015-06-22 18:49:56","https://www.truthorfiction.com/a-dog-meat-festival-is-held-each-year-in-yulin-china/"," Social media has lit up with calls to stop a dog meat eating festival held each year in Yulin, China. "," It’s true, a dog meat festival is held in China every summer. The Yulin Summer Solstice Lychee and Dog Meat Festival is held each year in Yulin to mark the beginning of summer. The local tradition started in the 1990s, but the practice of eating dog meat in China dates back centuries, Time reports : “According to Chinese lore, eating dog meat stimulates internal heat, making it a food that wards off winters’ cold. But on this inaugural day of summer, it’s a superstition that’s driving dog consumption: the meat is believed to bring good luck and health. At the festival, hotpots are fired up, lychees peeled and liquors poured. Animal activists estimate over 10,000 dogs are killed for the festival, according to China Daily , the government’s English-language mouthpiece.” Each year, millions of people take to social media sites to protest the so-called Yulin dog meat festival. But a state-run news agency claims that the festival is a “only a local folk tradition, without official sanction.” In 2011, the dog meat festival was “banned” by Chinese officials because of outrage on social media sites. Then, officials in Yulin responded with a public statement that denied the existence of a dog meat festival. The statement said locals had hosted small gatherings to eat dog meat, but there was never a widespread festival for it. But a state-run news agency reported in 2014 that the dog meat festival had started a week early to avoid protestors and journalists from attending. Also, Humane Society International reported finding dog collars at slaughterhouses in Yulin, which indicated that dogs were stolen from their owners and butchered there. ","Food - Drink"
"Deadly Brazilian Wandering Spider Found in Bananas-Reported as Fiction!","2015-06-22 18:47:05","https://www.truthorfiction.com/deadly-brazilian-wandering-spider-found-in-bananas/"," Shoppers have been warned to check bananas for spider eggs after a woman found a nest of Brazilian Wandering Spiders, the world’s most venomous, in a bunch of bananas. "," : Don’t believe reports about deadly Brazilian Wandering Spiders (also known as Banana Spiders) being found in fruit at supermarkets. Many claims about shoppers bringing Brazilian Wandering Spiders home from the supermarket in bunches of bananas have surfaced over the years. Most have turned out to be false alarms, including one from England that went viral in June 2015. The story went viral in June 2015 when a family allegedly had to flee their home because a bunch of bananas from an Aldi supermarket was infested with Brazilian Wandering Spider eggs. The Express reported that a wildlife expert confirmed that the eggs were from a Brazilian Wandering Spider, and the store was closed for half a day while it was searched for spiders. But an Aldi spokesperson later said the eggs were not from a Brazilian Wandering Spider, and the store had been shut down as a precaution: “The safety of our customers is our absolute no 1 priority and as such, the bananas in question were immediately removed from the store as a precautionary measure. Following independent expert analysis, we can confirm that the eggs in question were totally harmless and not from the Brazilian Wandering Spider (Phoneutria fera). Whilst our bananas are of the highest quality and delivered by one of the world’s largest suppliers, these incidents, whilst extremely rare, can occur and we apologise for the distress caused to Mr Hobbs and his family. The Watling Street store in Hinckley is now fully open to customers.” Similar reports about Brazilian Wandering Spiders went viral in 2013 and 2014 . There’s a good chance that the eggs were misidentified in those cases, too. Again, eggs were found, but not the actual spider (or insect) that laid them. Richard Vetter, a retired research associate of entomology at the University of California at Riverside, told Live Science that it’s really hard to identify spider egg sacks without the spider that laid them, which often leads to confusion and false reports: “Egg sacks are much harder to identify than spiders. To identify them, you need familiarity with the spider first, then the egg sack,” Vetter said. It’s unlikely that British exterminators would be intimately familiar with the egg sacks of spiders from South and Central America, he added. However, it is possible that the eggs in question belonged to an arachnid, Vetter said. There are several genera of spider that sometimes survive the long trip from banana-producing nations — such as Brazil, Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica — to other parts of the world. Among them are Phoneutria and Cupiennius, two types of spiders that are commonly known as wandering spiders. Wandering spiders are named for their tendency to wander around looking for food instead of spinning a web. As nocturnal hunters, bothPhoneutria and Cupiennius sometimes seek out shelter during the day under the broad leaves of banana trees. And because of their preference for these fruit trees, species of both genera at times wind up in grocery stores and residences in Europe and North America, Vetter said. Typically, when one of these big, hairy spiders shows up overseas, it automatically gets labeled as a “deadly” Brazilian wandering spider without anyone identifying what genus or species the spider belongs to, Vetter said. And that’s a shame, he said, because only one of the two genera of wandering spiders, Phoneutria, contains species that could actually pose a threat to humans. The other genus, Cupiennius, contains some big, but totally harmless, spiders. And reports that Brazilian Wandering Spiders are extremely deadly may be overblown, too. Richard Vetter said a study that looked at 422 Brazilian Wandering Spider bites found that only two people died, and they were both small children. TruthorFiction.com has reached out to Aldi for comment on whether the supermarket has ever actually found a Brazilian Wandering Spider at a store, and future updates will be posted here. For now, we’re reporting this one as fiction. ","Food - Drink"

"," Reports that crabs imported from China have been injected with formalin are false. Formalin can be used as an embalming fluid to preserve animal specimens and tissue samples that are studied under microscopes. It can also be diluted and used as a disinfectant to kill parasites in fish. The FDA has approved three diluted forms of formalin for use in finned food fish and fish eggs, but crab is not listed among its approved uses. The FDA approval means that these forms of formalin are “scientifically show to be safe and effective when used according to the directions on the label.” However, there haven’t been any credible reports of crab imported from China being injected with toxic levels of formalin, as the social media posts claim. And photos that appear with these social media reports don’t show crabs being injected with formalin. They are from a December 2014 blog post that warns Malaysian consumers about crabs that have been injected with a solution to make them weigh more. According to a translated version of the blog post : “Be careful when you buy crab at this time because there are reliable reports that there is a pinhole in the abdomen because the crabs have injected feared and pricked with water to preserve freshness and increase the weight of the crab.” China is among the world’s largest producers of farm-raised fish.

"Fetal Cells Are Ingredients in Food and Drinks-Fiction!","2015-04-17 15:24:48","https://www.truthorfiction.com/fetal-cells-are-ingredients-in-food-and-drinks/"," Embryonic kidney cells from aborted babies are used as an ingredient in food and drinks. "," Cells from aborted babies aren’t used as ingredients in food and drinks. The claim first emerged in 2011 when Senomyx, a company that develops flavor ingredients, announced a partnership with PepsiCo. Their goal was to develop “high-potency sweeteners” to reduce the amount of sugar in soft drinks. At the time, the anti-abortion group Children of God For Life issued a press release that said Senomyx had used human embryonic kidney cells (also called HEK 293) to test its products. The group called for a boycott of companies that had partnered with Senomyx. The original claim that Senomyx had used HEK 293 to test its products appears to be true. But that original claim has morphed over the years. Today, viral emails and blogs claim that cells from aborted babies are used as ingredient, which is false. The HEK 293 cell line dates back to the 1970s. Today, it’s commonly used to test new drugs and vaccines, Forbes reports : “The cells, called HEK 293 cells (that stands for human embryonic kidney) were taken from an aborted fetus in the 1970s in the Netherlands. Bits of chopped up DNA from the adenovirus, a virus that causes a pretty severe cold. The kidney cells were forced to take up bits of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 that used a calcium solution. The resulting cells don’t act much like human cells at all, but they are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. That’s why they’re used in the development of drugs and vaccines. No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isn’t leading to new abortions.” It seems that Senomyx has engineered HEK cells to function as human taste-receptor cells, ABC News reports : “This way, Senomyx can test millions of substances to see if they work as different types of taste enhancers without subjecting human volunteers to endless taste tests.” In 2008, Senomyx was awarded a patent on “recombinant methods for expressing a function sweet taste receptor” that lists HEK 293 as part of the process. CBS News found in 2011 that many of the company’s 77 patents listed HEK 293. The Miami New Times asked Gwen Rosenberg, the vice president of investor relations and corporate communications at Senomyx, about it in a 2011 interview : “Asked about the action alert, Rosenberg said, ‘We don’t discuss details of our research, but you won’t find anything on our website about HEK 293.’ I asked Rosenberg if Senomyx had a position on stem cell research. ‘We’ve never been asked that,’ she replied, ‘We don’t have a position on anything. We’re dedicated to finding new flavors to reduce sugars and reduce salt. Our focus is to help consumers with diabetes or high blood pressure have a better quality of life.’” So, while it appears that HEK 293 cells are used to develop and test new ingredients, the claim that the cells themselves are used for ingredients is false.

Reports that “under god” had been left off cans of soda showed up after the 9/11 terrorists attacks. TruthorFiction.com investigated back then, and we found that Dr Pepper — not Pepsi — had in fact released a can of soda that said “One Nation … Indivisible” across the top. Click here for the story. Critics said that Dr Pepper left out “under god” because the company wanted to be politically correct. The led some to call for boycotts of the soda. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group responded : “In recent days, several news media outlets in the country have reported on a special edition Dr Pepper can that was created to show support for the patriotic fervor that has been sweeping America since the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, and to show the world that we are a united nation of people who place a high value upon freedom. Much of the information being circulated on this subject is incomplete or inaccurate. Here are the facts: “The can, released last November, features an image of the Statue of Liberty along with the words ‘One Nation … Indivisible.’ “The special packaging was designed to reflect our pride in this country’s determination to stand together as one. The Statue of Liberty and Pledge of Allegiance were chosen as two of the greatest symbols of American freedom. “Due to space limitations on the can, only a few of the 31 words from the Pledge of Allegiance could be used. The available area for graphics limited the amount of verbiage on the can. “Of the 31 words in the Pledge of Allegiance, only three were included. More than 90 percent were not included. “We at Dr Pepper/Seven Up strongly believe that the message on these cans is a resoundingly patriotic, bipartisan message that we are a united nation. “More than 41 million special edition cans were ordered by Dr Pepper bottlers in portions of a dozen states.  Because the limited edition patriotic can is to be retired in February, you will soon see regular packaging graphics for Dr Pepper at your local retail stores.” That should have settled it, but somehow the eRumor has changed over the years. Now chain emails urge people to boycott Pepsi because it supposedly left “under god” off its cans. That isn’t true. Pepsi responded directly: “You’ve received an erroneous email about a ‘patriotic can’ that Pepsi allegedly produced with an edited version of America’s Pledge of Allegiance. The truth is, Pepsi never produced such a can. In fact, this is a hoax that has been circulating on the Internet for more than six years. A patriotic package used in 2001 by Dr Pepper (which is not a part of PepsiCo) was inappropriately linked to Pepsi.

"," It’s true that a number of California wineries were sued for high levels of arsenic in their wines, but the lawsuit is misleading. The class action lawsuit claims that 28 California wineries bottled wine that had unsafe levels of inorganic arsenic. It said there was 500% more arsenic in some wine samples than is allowed in drinking water: “Defendants produce, manufacture and/or distribute wine in California that contains inorganic arsenic in amounts far in excess of what is allowed in drinking water. Defendants do not warn that their products contain unsafe amounts of inorganic arsenic, nor do they disclose even the existence of inorganic arsenic in the wine.” The problem is that it’s misleading to compare the allowable arsenic levels of drinking water and wine. The EPA allows arsenic levels to reach 10 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water — but there aren’t any specific limits on allowable arsenic levels in wine. Even so, that doesn’t mean that arsenic levels in California wines are unsafe or toxic. Other countries allow much more arsenic in wine than the EPA allows in drinking water. The International Organization of Vine and Wine, which regulates wine makers in 45 countries, sets the limit for total arsenic in wine at 200 ppb. In Canada and the European Union, the limit is 100 ppb. Besides, the lawsuit doesn’t attack the California wine makers for dangerous amounts of arsenic. It claims the companies broke state laws because they didn’t disclose that there was any arsenic at all in their wines on the labels. That basically means that every California winery would have to make the same disclosure, because arsenic is in almost all food and drinks. The Wine Institute, which represents 1,000 California wineries, called the lawsuit “irresponsible” in a statement : “Arsenic is prevalent in the natural environment in air, soil and water, and in food. As an agricultural product, wines from throughout the world contain trace amounts of arsenic, as do juices, vegetables, grains and other alcohol beverages. There is no research that shows that the amounts found in wine pose a health risk to consumers. “The U.S. Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), the agency that regulates wine, beer and spirits, monitors wines for compounds, including arsenic, as part of its testing program as does FDA as part of its Total Diet Study. While there are no established limits in the U.S., several countries, including the European Union, have established limits of 100 parts per billion or higher for wine. California wine exports are tested by these governments and are below the established limits.” Whether or not the federal government should set limits for the amount of arsenic allowed in wine is open for debate. But even if it does, the level won’t be the same as drinking water’s, which is what the eRumor seems to imply. ","Food - Drink"

"The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic-Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:41:03","https://www.truthorfiction.com/toxic-wheat/"," Wheat is toxic because farmers routinely apply Roundup to crops days before harvest to dry down or kill the plants. "," The theory that Roundup makes wheat toxic is yet another unproven attempt to explain why more and more people are suffering from wheat intolerance. The eRumor first appeared in a blog published by the Healthy Home Economist in November 2014. The post claims that farmers who treat crops with Roundup days before harvest are to blame for wheat intolerance, which is also referred to as celiac disease or a gluten allergy. The post, which was quickly shared more than 560,000 times on Facebook, states: “Wheat harvest protocol in the United States is to drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine harvesters work through the fields as withered, dead wheat plants are less taxing on the farm equipment and allows for an earlier, easier and bigger harvest.” It’s true that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, can be applied to wheat before harvest in a process known as “desiccation.” However, it’s not clear how often desiccation is used. According to the University of Minnesota Extension : “Research has shown that glyphosate applied with or without ammonium sulfate may hasten dry down of the wheat crop if conditions for dry down are adverse. With a pre-harvest interval of seven days, a couple of days at the most, may be gained.” The use of desiccation “has increased steadily,” but there’s still not enough experimental data to determine desiccation’s impact on wheat and seed quality, the Journal of Seed Science reports . So, while desiccation is used by wheat farmers, claims that it’s the new “harvest protocol” are unproven. Those claims often cite USDA statistics that report 98 percent of spring wheat, 99 percent of durum wheat and 61 percent of winter wheat was treated with glyphosate in 2012. However, those statistics don’t tell us how often wheat was treated days before harvest — only what percentage was treated at some point in the crop’s lifecycle. TruthorFiction.com reached out to the National Association of Wheat Growers for comment on the prevalence of desiccation. Future updates will be posted here. It is true, however, that glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide on food crops. Anywhere from 13 to 20 million acres of crops are treated with 18.7 million gallons of it each year, the EPA says . The eRumor’s claim that glyphosate causes wheat intolerance is also proven. A 2009 study on glyphosate’s impact on freshwater fish is regularly cited when health claims are made about glyphosate. The study found that glyphosate created “severe pathological lesions” and “microridges” in the digestive tracts of fish. That rendered them unable to “lubricate ingested food” or to “withstand trauma resulting from ingested material.” A scientific paper published in 2013 called for additional research to determine whether or not glyphosate has the same impact on human digestive systems because its effects would be similar to celiac disease. The researchers concluded: “The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate. The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyhposate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply … We urge governments globally to reexamine their policy towards glyphosate and to introduce new legislation that would restrict its usage.” There’s no doubt that wheat intolerance is on the rise. The Mayo Clinic estimates that four times more people are affected by it today than in the 1950s. The only question is why it has been on the rise, and researchers don’t have a definitive answer. Dr. Chella David, a geneticist and immunologist at Mayo, says it could be caused by immune systems turning on themselves because our environments are so sterile that they have nothing else to attack. He says differences in the ways wheat is processed and eaten could be a factor as well. “Many of the processed foods we eat were not in existence 50 years ago,” David says. A number of theories exist to explain why more and more people can’t eat gluten, and the only clear answer is that more research is needed to find the true cause. Posted 11/14/14 ","Food - Drink"

"Cancer can be caused by foods in plastics and that’s how Sheryl Crow gotcancer-Fiction! and Unproven!","2015-03-17 21:40:51","https://www.truthorfiction.com/dioxins/"," There are a several versions of this eRumor. The first to appear on the Internet was a message that says a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from the Castle Hospital (no location mentioned) appeared on television and said plastic containers should not be used for heating foods in a microwave oven. He said this is especially true if the foods contain fat. The message claims that the combination of fats and plastics will release dioxins into the food and into the cells of the body with a risk of cancer. The doctor recommended using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers instead in order to avoid the dioxin. Prepared foods such as TV dinners should be taken out of plastic containers before heating. The second version tells the story of a seventh-grade student who decided to do some experiments with microwave radiation on food wrapped in plastic. She is said to have enlisted the help of the National Center for “Toxicological”  Research in Arkansas.  The student allegedly found that not only are there carcinogens migrating from the plastic into food during microwaving, but other substances as well. This eRumor also lists an article about Dr. Edward Fujimoto saying that he appeared on a TV station in Huntsville, Alabama. Another version claims all this was in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center. Yet another version says that singer Sheryl Crow, who is suffering from breast cancer, got her cancer from drinking from plastic water bottles left in the sun and that got too hot and, as a result, were contaminated with dioxins. "," TruthOrFiction.com has not been able to find any research that supports the fear that food can become contaminated with dioxins either from plastic wrap or plastic in microwave ovens. It’s an understandable concern because dioxins are among the most poisonous chemical group known and steps have been taken by many world governments to reduce the amounts of dioxins in the environment. Dr. Edward Fujimoto is real and is the Manager of the Wellness and Lifestyle Medicine Department at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii. (not Alabama).  Part of this eRumor is the result of an interview he did on KHON-TV channel 2 in Hawaii on January 23, 2002. TruthOrFiction.com contacted Dr. Fujimoto who said the eRumor quoted him fairly accurately.  His concern was whether a combination of ingredients, especially plastics and food fats, could result in food being contaminated by dioxins when heated in a microwave. That is his observation and he claims to have research substantiating it. TruthOrFiction.com has twice asked for him to give us that research but has never received it.  He said that he is surprised about how little Americans know about dioxins in everyday life because in Japan, the majority of the population knows about them and the country has enacted regulations to protect its people.  He explained that in his view, heating food in a plastic container will produce the release of dioxins and fat will absorb them. The amount of migration of dioxins to fat, he said, will be a function of the heat in the microwave, the type of plastic, the length of time of exposure, and the amount of fat that is in contact.  Dr. Fujimoto pointed out that the amounts of dioxins in any given piece of plastic or food that is microwaved in plastic is very small, but that the problem is that dioxins get into the human body and accumulate. He sad that in Japan, there has been a complete change in the way foods are packaged so that plastic is avoided. They use more glass, for example. In early 2004, a corrupted version of the eRumor started circulating that made it appear as though Dr. Fujimoto was also concerned about putting water in plastic bottles and freezing it, but he never addressed that.  This version of the eRumor also made it sound as though the plastic itself was the problem, not the plastic in combination with food and heat.  It says, for example, that the heat causes dioxin (sic) to “drip from the plastic” into the food but none of the researchers has claimed that. A variation of the bottled water version said that was how singer Sheryl Crow got cancer, by drinking bottled water and that she appeared on the Ellen show or the Oprah show to tell the story. Crow has been treated for breast cancer but she’s never blamed it on bottled water. Another version of eRumor about the seventh-grader has been a little more difficult to detail.  We’ve confirmed that there is a Dr. Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxilogical Research who, along with a Claire V. Nelson, published a paper at a professional event in Orlando, Florida in 1998 and it was on the subject of food contamination from plastic wrap.   We’ve not found the actual study, however, and have never received a response from Dr. Wilkes. The eRumor about Jon Wilkes and Claire Nelson appears to have come from the Options Newsletter published by People Against Cancer at www.peopleagainstcancer.com . The folks who make Saran Wrap have responded to the eRumor.  A statement by the SC Johnson company says the “plasticizer” in Saran Wrap is derivative of naturally occurring citric acid found in citrus fruits and is 100% dioxin free.  The statement further adds that dioxins can only be formed with chlorine is combined with the kinds of high temperatures associated with waste incinerators, temperatures like 1,500 degrees F. Even the most powerful microwaves are not capable of those temperatures, according to the company. SC Johnson says none of its products contains dioxins. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dioxins are both natural and man-made.  The man-made dioxins are released into the air from sources like waste incineration, from burning fuels (like wood, coal or oil), and certain types of chemical processing.  Almost every person has been exposed to low levels of dioxins and the EPA says there is research that suggests that high levels of dioxins may be correlated with various health problems, although some of that is extrapolated from studies of animals, not humans. The only reference we could find about dioxins and microwaves was from an FDA publication that was concerned about dioxins resulting from the bleached manufacture of paper goods including milk cartons and some paper containers for microwave dinners.  That was not about plastics and high temperatures, however, and the levels of dioxins were described as safe. The Food and Safety Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has published guidelines for safe cooking in microwave ovens and warns against using materials that are not regarded as microwave safe. CLICK HERE for those guidelines.  You’ll note that one of the guidelines is to avoid letting plastic wraps touch food.  That is another issue, however, and not related to dioxins or high heat in microwaves. The Food and Drug Administration has also issued a statement about plastics and microwaves.v CLICK HERE for that document. The American Plastics Council has also posted a page on the subject. CLICK HERE for their take on the dioxin question. Somewhere along the way someone decided to add that all this information had appeared in newsletters from Johns Hopkins University and Walter Reed Army Medical center but neither has promoted the dioxin story. Even though Johns Hopkins has not been the source of the eRumor, there have been enough emails that falsely attributed the story to them that the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health asked Dr. Rolf Halden, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Services at the school’s Center for Water and Health to address the concerns over dioxins. He said that the principal sources of dioxins are from various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and volcanic eruptions.  Plastics do not actually contain dioxins, he said, but wastes that contain certain compounds can serve as dioxin precursors when incinerated. According to Halden, most people are exposed to dioxins when eating meat and fish rich in fat because dioxins that have been sent into the atmosphere become attached to particles that fall back to the earth and get concentrated and store in the fat of fish and other animals. Halden said that the alleged danger or freezing water in plastic bottles is unfounded and an urban legend.  First, because there are no dioxins in plastics.  Second because freezing actually inhibits the release of chemicals.  He said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water in the bottles, not the bottles themselves.  He added that there is another group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle that could disrupt endocrine functions in humans and animals and that heating up the plastics could increase their being released into water and food. Regarding cooking with plastics, Halden said that whenever you heat something it increases the likelihood that chemicals could be pulled out.  he recommends using heat-resistant glass or ceramics for microwave cooking, just to be safe.

"Butter versus Margarine-Truth! and Fiction!","2015-03-17 21:40:49","https://www.truthorfiction.com/butter-margarine/"," A list of comparative facts about margarine and butter. "," The heart of this eRumor, the comparison between butter and Margarine, has been circulating since 2005.  Later versions added the tidbit about Margarine being manufactured to fatten turkeys. We’ll go through the email one fact at time but it needs to be kept in mind that not every Margarine product is the same.  There are other spreads that are loosely called Margarine but may, for example, be part vegetable oil or a fat-free Margarine product. 1. Margarine was originally manufactured to fatten turkeys. When it killed The turkeys, the people who had put all the money into the research wanted a Payback so they put their heads together to figure out what to do with this Product to get their money back. It was a white substance with no food Appeal so they added the yellow coloring and sold it to people to use in Place of butter. How do you like it? They have come out with some clever New flavorings- Fiction! According to the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers, Margarine was the idea of a Frenchman named Hippolyte Mege-Mouriez in response to a request from Emperor Louis Napoleon for ideas for a substitute for butter.  In 1869 he used margaric acid and the name of his formulation became known as Margarine. It became a hit in the United States in the late 1800’s. 2.  Both have the same amount of calories- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 100 calories.  A tablespoon of Margarine is 100 calories. 3.  Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter, according to a recent Harvard Medical Study- Truth! But Updated! We didn’t find the “53%” study, but Harvard School of Public Health has published a report on this.  It says that more than 30 years ago research indicated that saturated fat (such as in butter) was bad for the heart and people were told to switch to margarine.  A Harvard study of women between 1980 and 1994 found a significant reduction of heart disease risk by reducing smoking, hormone treatment, and dietary improvements including reducing or eliminating saturated fat (such as in butter.)  Further research has shown, however, that some margarines contained trans fat, which was even worse for the heart than saturated fat.  The report cautions us not to make decisions as a result of just one study but to consider the body of recent research about an issue like butter versus margarine. 4. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 Grams- Truth! A tablespoon of butter is 7g of saturated fat.  A tablespoon of margarine is 2g of saturated fat. 5.  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other Foods- Unproven! We could not find anything definitive about this. 6.   Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! It depends on what you are measuring.  The advantage of butter is that it is a more natural product than margarine and does have more vitamin content.  But butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk.  Saturated fats are the ones that are solid at room temperature and increase the “bad” cholesterol (LDL) as well as the “good” cholesterol (HDL).  The disadvantage of true margarine is the trans fat level.  The more solid a margarine is at room temperature, the more trans fat it contains, as much as 3 grams per tablespoon.  Margarine makers have responded to that by releasing tub or liquid products that have either reduced or eliminated trans fats.  Watch for the labels.  Heart doctors recommend butter over normal margarine but recommend trans fat free margarines over butter.  It all gets very confusing.  There are even margarine products now that say they actually lower cholesterol. 7. Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods- A Matter of Personal Taste! 8. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for Less than 100 years- Fiction! Margarine was introduced as an inexpensive alternative in France in 1869, according to a history found in the Margarine and Spreads Association in the United Kingdom. 9.   Margarine is high in trans fatty acids- Truth! 10.  Margarine triples the risk of coronary heart disease- Unproven! Although trans fats are to be avoided, we did not find any research that says that the use of margarine triples the risk of heart disease. 11. Margarine ncreases total cholesterol and LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol)- Truth! 12. Increases the risk of cancers up to five fold- Fiction! We could not find any substantiation of this claim. 13. Margarine lowers quality of breast milk- Truth! We didn’t find any research on this but there are studies on how a mother’s eating of trans fats affects the level of trans fats in her milk. One study, for example, comparing Canadian breast milk to Chinese breast milk found that Canadian mothers had 33 more trans fats in their milk than the Chinese mothers.  So the quality of the breast milk can be affected by the consumption of trans fats. 14.  Margarine decreases immune response- Truth! We found several references to this including an article by nutritionist Dr. Mary Enig that said that consuming trans fatty acids “Affects immune response by lowering effeciency of B cell response and increasing proliferation of T cells.” 15. Decreases insulin response- Truth! Actually the trans fat can increase blood insulin levels, which increases the risk for diabetes. 16.  Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC- Fiction! We found no support for this.  Perhaps whoever wrote this heard a discussion about the “plasticity” of margarine.  It is “plastic” at room temperature meaning that the shape of it can be changed when pressure is applied.  That doesn’t mean it is composed of what we normally think of as plastic. It was originally made of animal fats but increasingly now is made from vegetable oils. Updated 3/29/07 ","Food - Drink"

Some regional Girl Scout councils have, however, partnered with Planned Parenthood to provide sex education in the past. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a Texas-based pro-life organization. The group became angry when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with a Planned Parenthood office in Waco. The confrontation led to a showdown between leaders of Pro-Life Waco and then-Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Kathy Clonginger on the “Today” show in March 2004. In a transcript of the exchange , Clogninger defended the council’s decision: The Girl Scouts in Waco, Texas, really made a decision based on local community context, they decided that in this particular situation that it would be in the best interest of girls and their families to discontinue the relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts is the largest voice for, and advocate for girls across the country. Know that girls grow up with very complex issues facing them. And so we do, across the country, tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the thing that’s girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs, and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls. …It’s really impossible for girls to grow up in today’s society with out having access to good information. We will continue to partner with organizations across this nation, and local community Girl Scouts will make decisions based on their local community partnerships and the needs of their girls and their families. Clonginger didn’t acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there’s no evidence that there ever was one. GSUSA says that the national chapter “does not take a position to develop materials” or programs regarding human sexuality, birth control or abortion. Rather, those decisions are made at the local level by parents, volunteers and council members: Parents or guardians make all decisions regarding program participation that may be of a sensitive nature. Consistent with that belief, GSUSA directs councils, including volunteer leaders, to get written parental permission for any locally planned program that could be considered sensitive. In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video : We do not now, nor have we ever, had a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Girl Scouts of the USA believes that reproductive issues are deeply private matters, best left to families. I find it unsettling that anyone would use the Girl Scout brand to have very adult conversations. A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement; it’s an investment in a little girl… Given Clonginger’s earlier remarks, Chavez’s statement has caused some confusion. The simple explanation is that Clonginger acknowledge local “relationships” between councils and Planned Parenthood while Chavez denied a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. There’s also been some confusion about where money from Girl Scout cookie sales go. A sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils. GSUSA doesn’t get a cut of the revenue, but it does get licensing royalties from bakers of the cookies: Girl Scout troops and groups must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and group travel. Girl Scouts may not earn proceeds as individuals; however, Girl Scout councils offer a wide variety of recognition items, program- and store-related credits, and travel experiences that girls are eligible to earn individually based on their sales. All troop proceeds and other rewards earned through participation in the Girl Scout Cookie Program must be used to enhance each girl’s Girl Scout experience. Each Girl Scout council releases an annual report each year. The only way to know how your local council spends those dollars is to review its annual report, or to ask a local staff member.

"," There is controversy over rBST, which stands for recombinant bovine somatotropin.  It is an artificial growth hormone used in cows. We’ve not found the family of Marissa, the 11-year old girl referenced in the eRumor.  If she is real her family’s suspicions are worthy of consideration but do not constitute proof that what they describe has been caused by ingesting milk from Wal-Mart.  There are other conditions that can cause early menstruation such as hypothyroidism.  Also, although there are fears, there is not scientific agreement about whether rBST is harmful to humans. RBST is a synthetic version of bST or BGH, a natural growth hormone in cows which, among other things, affects the amount of milk produced by a dairy cow.  Use of bST to increase milk production has been around since the 1930’s then along then the synthetic version came into popularity. Critics of the use of rBST say that it is banned for use in cattle in virtually every major country in the world except the United States.  They point out that there is an increase in health problems in cattle that produce the most milk so the use of rBST should be avoided on that ground. Supporters say rBST helps dairy farmers with better milk yield and that there has not been any proof that the hormone causes problems in humans.  It is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although this eRumor focused on Wal-Mart milk there are several different milk companies that use cattle treated with rBST and Wal-Mart also sells milk from cows that are not injected with it.  Because of the controversy over rBST a lot of the milk products without it are labeled as such and are not hard to find.

Its list of ingredients includes caramel color and natural and artificial flavors. The eRumor alleges that the caramel coloring found in the Pumpkin Spice Latte is a cancer-causing chemical compound called 4-MEI, or Class IV Caramel Coloring. But there’s no evidence that the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte includes 4-MEI, or that it actually causes cancer. According to the FDA : Foods containing added colors must list them either by name or as “artificial colors” in the ingredients statement on the food label. Because there are other artificial colors, the presence of “artificial colors” on a food label does not necessarily mean that caramel coloring is contained in the food. Also, the presence of “caramel coloring” on a food label does not necessarily mean that the food contains 4-MEI, because the term “caramel coloring” also may be used to describe Class I and Class II caramel coloring. Class I and Class II caramel coloring do not contain 4-MEI. And, even if Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte does include 4-MEI, FDA says there’s no proof that it’s harmful to humans: Based on the available information, FDA has no reason to believe that there is any immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food from the use of caramel coloring. It’s also “virtually impossible” to eliminate 4-MEI from foods because its not an additive. It’s a byproduct of food prep activities like roasting coffee beans or grilling meats, FDA says.

"Monster Energy Drinks are Satanic-Fiction!","2015-03-17 20:39:47","https://www.truthorfiction.com/monster-drinks-satanic/"," Subtle satanic references can be found in Monster Energy’s logo and branding. "," The marketing firm that developed the name, brand and package design for Monster Energy told TruthorFiction.com that there aren’t any hidden satanic messages in it. Rumors that that the Monster brand hides subliminal satanic messages went viral after an unidentified woman made that claim in a video posted in November 2014. In the video, the woman claims that the “M” that appears on cans of Monster is actually “Vav,” the Hebrew numeral for six , repeated three times. She interprets that to mean “666.” The woman also claims a crucifix can be found inside the “O” of the Monster banner logo. She interprets the two occurrences to represent “the beast” from the Book of Revelations. “This is not a Christian company at all,” the woman said. “So why would they have a cross on the can? Here is the message: Anti-Christ.” TruthorFiction.com tracked down McLean Design, the firm that Hansen Beverage Corporation hired to developed the name, logo and packaging for what would become “Monster” way back in 2000, to find out the truth. Rifle Hughes, managing director of McLean Design, emphatically denied that Monster’s brand has any subliminal messaging, satanic or otherwise. “The facts are that we were there,” Hughes said. “We were at all of the client meetings and putting in hours at the studio creating what has become one of the most recognized brands in popular culture. Trust me, there was nothing in the creative brief about anything spiritual or layering hidden meanings.” The firm outlines its work to brand “Monster” in this case study . In 1997, Hansen helped launched the energy drink market, but its market share had dropped to just 8 percent by 2000. Hansen turned to McLean Design to develop an edgy brand that would “drive sales, volume and market penetration” for a new line of 16-ounce cans of energy drink. The firm settled on three finalists for the new brand’s name: “Fatboy,” “Deuce” and “Monster.” Ultimately, the company said, it went with “Monster” because of the 16-ounce can’s larger size, as well as its “maniacal energy,” and its status as a “social renegade.” And the “M” logo was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, not satan. “We designed the logo to be an iconic ‘M’ that would imply the presence of a monster’s claws ripping through the can. It’s the whole, ‘the monster you don’t see is scarier’ thing — see Hitchcock,” Hughes said. And Hughes said there’s no crucifix inside the Monster banner’s “O,” either. “The ‘O’ was part of an existing typeface,” Hughes said. “We added the bone through the ‘O’ to make it more menacing. It’s not a hidden cross. It’s not a cross at all. It’s not even a Psi. It’s an ‘O.’” Hughes said conspiracy theories about the Monster’s brand are nothing new, and he doesn’t expect them to go away anytime soon. “The issue with all these online theories is that they cherry pick historical symbology, make some pretty wild leaps in connection, and force-fit some ‘ah-ha’ that they often believe to be there before they start connecting the dots,” Hughes said.

"," This eRumor has more to do with the controversy of consuming wild caught fish over fish that is farm raised.  China is a major producer of farm raised tilapia but sanitation conditions of ponds may not be as big of a concern when compared to dumping of  chemicals and drugs into the water where these tasty fish are raised. According to the seafood watch fact sheet by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California, tilapia is a fresh water snapper that is farmed in ponds, closed re-circulating systems or tank systems.  About 40% of the world’s tilapia comes from China.  Other countries that farm tilapia in mass production are the U.S., Canada, Ecuador, and Taiwan.  The fish is a native to Africa and is considered a “fast-growing tropical species.”  The fact sheet also said that it “is the fourth most-consumed seafood in the United States after shrimp, tuna and salmon.” Consuming fish has health benefits but experts say that wild caught fish is preferable to those raised on a farm.  This according to a November 19, 2012 article by the Washington Post that warned of “heavy use of chemicals — including pesticides and antibiotic and antifungal drugs — in many aquaculture operations,” a process to help maintain the health of fish in overcrowded habitats.  The article also said that the experts suggested that it was healthier to eat farmed fish than no fish at all.  Moderation was the key to a healthier life by including half a pound of fish in the weekly diet. The allegation that farm raised tilapia in China were being fed chicken and pig feces also remains unproven. “In many cases, fish farmed in Asia and imported to the US have been raised on diets of chicken and pig feces.” This according to a July 15, 2013 article by MSNBC but in an update at the bottom of this same article cites a denial by a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “ FDA spokesperson Theresa Eisenman flatly denied that the widespread practice of feeding feces to farmed fish occurs.” Eisenman said, “We are not aware of evidence to support the claim that this practice is occurring in China, Both domestic and imported seafood products are required to meet the same food safety standards.

"," We don’t know who the original author is of this email or his or her motives, but there is a lot said about Pyrex and the company that makes Pyrex that is incorrect. Pyrex is one of the most widely used products in American households and has been used safely for decades. According to World Kitchen, the makers of Pyrex, there has never been a recall of Pyrex or any concern about its safety on the part of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Like all glassware, Pyrex needs to be used according to instructions.  At the time of our investigation we found on the Pyrex website an advisory to consumers not to subject the product to extreme temperature changes, such as putting a Pyrex dish directly on a burner, under a broiler, adding liquid to a hot dish or placing a hot dish on a cold or wet surface.  Under those circumstances the glass can break. The claim that the current makers of Pyrex abandoned borosilicate glass in favor or poorer quality soda lime glass is false. World Kitchen told TruthOrFiction.com that Pyrex has been made from heat-strengthened soda lime glass for about 60 years and that the switch was first made by Corning, not World Kitchen.  The company added, “Consumers should know that soda lime glass, such as that used to make PYREX glass bakeware, is significantly more resistant to breaking on impact than borosilicate glass and comparably resistant to breakage caused by severe temperature changes.” It is also false that World Kitchen is not a U.S. company.  It is an American firm and Pyrex is manufactured in the U.S.A..

For that reason, we want to remind consumers to review the PYREX® Safety and Usage Instructions provided with our products. While not a substitute for reviewing the entire Safety and Usage Instructions, set forth below are selected highlights. PYREX GLASS BAKEWARE SAFETY AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: NEVER use on top of the stove, under a broiler, in a toaster oven, or place over oven vent or pilot light. AVOID severe hot to cold temperature changes, including: DO NOT add liquid to hot dish. DO NOT place hot dish or glass cover in sink. DO NOT immerse hot dish in water.

Sazarac, Inc., bottler and distributor of Fireball Whiskey, announced the recall in a statement released on October 28, 2014. Batches of the cinnamon-flavored whiskey were recalled in Europe, Finland, Sweden and Norway because it contained more of the ingredient propylene glycol (PG) than allowed in those regions. “Regulations for product formulations are different in Europe, which explains why recipes for products like soft drinks, alcohol/spirits and even candies and confections are slightly different than their North American counterparts,” Sazarac said. “Fireball, therefore, has a slightly different recipe for Europe. Unfortunately, Fireball shipped its North American formula to Europe and found that one ingredient is out of compliance with European regulations.” The company assured consumers that Fireball Whiskey was a safe drink, and that PG has been used as a flavoring ingredient for more than 50 years. However, reports that Fireball Whiskey included an anti-freeze ingredient quickly went viral. It’s true that the ingredient PG is sometimes used as an anti-freeze agent, the EPA reports .

"," It’s not true that chocolate from Africa was accidentally laced with “Ebola positive blood.” The false report can be traced back to a Twitter account operated by “Conspiracy Story.” The eRumor claims that a factory worker in South Africa who later tested positive for Ebola bled into a batch of melted chocolate that was shipped to the U.S. and distributed to stores. However, there haven’t been any confirmed cases of Ebola in South Africa, the CDC reports . The virus has been limited to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Spain and the United States — which makes the eRumor a hoax. The eRumor may have been inspired by credible news reports that Ebola could disrupt the global chocolate market. About 70 percent of the world’s cocoa supply comes from West African nations, and people began to speculate that cocoa prices, which hit a four-year high in August 2014, were driven by the Ebola pandemic. But Amal Ahmad, a chocolate analyst, told ABC News that basic economic trends were to blame for the higher prices, not Ebola. Posted 11/03/14 ","Food - Drink"

After growing tired of discarding   imperfect carrots at his Bakersfield packaging plant,   Mike Yurosek came up with a solution of whittling down grown-up castoff   carrots into what we know today as “Baby Cut Carrots.”     Nearly 70% of carrots picked or close to 400 tons a day of undesirable   twisted, knobby, bent, or broken carrots called “culls” would be   discarded down the “cull chute”.   The nicer looking carrots   that remained were being packaged and sent to stores, says the article. By applying a little imagination, Yurosek   came up with the technique using an   industrial potato peeler that resembled a cement mixer along with a used   green-bean cutter to cut 2-inch baby   cut carrots from the unwanted carrot culls.  Thus creating the   standard size for America’s most popular “ready to eat” healthy snack. Baby cut carrots are   safe to eat right out of the bag.  According to the web site for Grimway   farms of California, one of the country’s leading producer of carrots,   baby cut carrots are washed in water with a small amount of chlorine   prior to packaging.  The chlorinated water solution for cleaning   food products is so miniscule that it presents no health risk.    According to the Food and Drug Administration website, the organization   that regulates the treatment of “ready to eat” cut vegetables, all   products must be rinsed in potable water prior to bagging and shipping. updated 9/22/08 ","Food - Drink"

"E.coli bacteria found in bagged salads?-Truth!","2015-03-17 17:57:32","https://www.truthorfiction.com/salads/"," There are a couple of stories about this. One warning says that a documentary on Dateline TV showed that E.coli bacteria were found in pre-packaged bags of salad and that the Dole company has issued a recall on some bags. The other from September of 2006 says the Food and Drug Administration has issued an alert that a strain of E.coli bacterium has been found in several U.S. states and that pre-packaged bags of spinach are suspect. "," Both warnings are true. On September 18, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its warning about spinach, telling consumers not to eat any raw spinach, not just pre-packaged spinach as had initially been announced. The FDA also announced that it’s probe into the sources of spinach contaminated with a strain of E.coli bacterium had been expanded to other companies. On September 15, 2006, the FDA had announced that Natural Selection Foods of San Juan Bautista, California was recalling all of its products that contain spinach that have “best if used by” dates of August 17, 2006 through October 1, 2006 The FDA is continuing to investigate whether any other brands are involved. According to an FDA release, “Natural Selection Foods, LLC brands include: Natural Selection Foods, Pride of San Juan, Earthbound Farm, Bellissima, Dole, Rave Spinach, Emeril, Sysco, O Organic, Fresh Point, River Ranch, Superior, Nature’s Basket, Pro-Mark, Compliments, Trader Joe’s, Ready Pac, Jansal Valley, Cheney Brothers, Coastline, D’Arrigo Brothers, Green Harvest, Mann, Mills Family Farm, Pro*Act, Premium Fresh, Snoboy, The Farmer’s Market, Tanimura & Antle, President’s Choice, Cross Valley, and Riverside Farms. These products include spinach and any salad with spinach in a blend, both retail and food service products. Products that do not contain spinach are not part of this recall.” The FDA said that 109 cases of illness had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control including one death and 14 cases of what is called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a form of kidney failure. States included in the warning include: California, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The FDA said the affected products were also distributed to Canada and Mexico. The other story was focused on Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The Dateline show aired in April, 2006. When more than 10 cases of sick people with similar symptoms showed up within three days in September, 2005, a public health investigation was launched.  The Minnesota Department of Public Health speculated that the sicknesses were food-related. One of the investigators suspected E.coli because of the symptoms of abdominal cramps and severe, bloody diarrhea.  The problem was that E.coli poisoning was more commonly associated with eating contaminated and improperly cooked meat.  One of the foods that most of the sick people had eaten was salads made from bagged lettuce. When a public health warning was issued about the salads, one of the victims called investigators from his hospital room and said he still had a partially-eaten bag in his refrigerator.  That lettuce was tested and became the first evidence that the E.coli had come from the pre-packaged salads.  The odd thing was that the bacterium was found in the lettuce, not just on it. As a result of that 2005 outbreak, the Dole company issued a voluntary recall for the “American Blend” and “Classic Romaine” packaged salads.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also issued a nationwide health alert in October, 2005, about the particular Dole salads implicated in the outbreak.

Her    understanding of pharmacology and metabolism is largely    incorrect”.  He concludes by saying, “…, this series of    allegations by MS. Markle are almost totally without foundation.
