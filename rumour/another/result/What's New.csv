  Not unexpectedly, this past year saw its fair share of Internet pranks, lies and hoaxes. Narrowing the list five has been a challenge, but I've tried to select some of the more preposterous and annoying specimens, in addition to the most viral, for this year-end review. What were the wackiest hoaxes of 2015? I'm do glad you asked.
  Just days after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the donation of all but one percent of his fortune to charity, a post went viral claiming he would also give away $4.5 million each to 1,000 Facebook users who copied and pasted the post.
  There's no way of knowing exactly how many people have shared the post, but that number is probably well into the six figures by now.
  If, in fact, Zuckerberg had announced such a giveaway — which would have amounted to billions of dollars in the end — the media would have had a field day with it. Instead, the media had a field day debunking the claim, which in the end was only the latest incarnation of one of the oldest Internet hoaxes around . Just ask Bill Gates. More »

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  '600-Pound Woman Gives Birth to 40-Pound Baby,' screamed the Jan. 14, 2015 headline on the World News Daily Report website. The birth took place at a hospital in Perth, Australia, supposedly, where the records were duly checked and it was determined that the infant was, in fact, the largest baby ever born.
  What I'll grant you is that, if any of the above were true, it would have been the largest baby ever born. By far. The biggest newborn on record prior to this weighed a mere 22 pounds.
  But none of the above is true. World News Daily Report is a satire website. All of its 'news' is made up. Buried on its disclaimer page is this statement: 'All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.' More »
  What's in a name? Nothing much according to Shakespeare, who observed that a rose 'by any other name would smell as sweet.'
  Facebook begs to differ. The social media giant's name policy requires that members use 'authentic identities' — the names they use in real life, in other words. 'Pretending to be anything or anyone isn't allowed.'
  That being the case, even the media was credulous when an Australian man by the name of Phuc Dat Bich captured the world's attention by complaining that Facebook had canceled his account three times on the grounds that he had violated said policy. He even posted a scan of his passport to prove he was using his 'real name.'
  Alas, it was too good to be true. In November, after riding the media fame train under false pretenses for a full 10 months, Mr. Bich -- who now claimed his real name was Joe Carr (rhymes with 'Joker'?) -- admitted he had made the whole thing up , right down to the fake passport photo. More »
  In November 2015, the Internet went nuts over a report published on the website NewsWatch33.com warning that the earth would be subjected to 15 days of darkness during the month of December due to a 'close parallelism' of the planets Venus and Jupiter that would cause a massive explosion on the sun.
  What's more, the report claimed, all this was confirmed by NASA in its own 1,000-page scientific study presented to the Obama administration.
  Never mind that anyone who cared to check could have easily found out that the same BS has circulated time and time again on the Internet for years. More »
  In April 2015, a poorly written, misspelled 'news story' went viral claiming that the popular canned beverage AriZona Tea was being pulled off the shelves by the FDA because a chemical analysis had determined it contains human urine.
  'According to the FDA,' the article said, 'urine has been suspected to be used in AriZona products for a [sic] years and it is what gives it its signature flavor, surprisingly.'
  Were AriZona products in fact removed from store shelves at any point during 2015? No, because the story was utter bunk. Its source, a lame humor website called Huzlers.com, bills itself as 'the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website in the world with the most shocking headlines and articles shared by trillions around the world.'
  The story was so ridiculous that the AriZona company didn't even bother to deny it. More »

"Here's how We Know That Giant Shrimp on the Internet Is Bogus","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/ss/109-Pound-Shrimp-Caught-in-Florida.htm","109-Pound Shrimp Caught in Florida","2015-11-29 06:18:26","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: September 2015 Status: Fake
  Analysis: This photo of a fisherman allegedly holding a 109-pound shrimp caught in waters off Florida has been circulating since 2010. It has appeared on Facebook, Twitter, various other social sites, and before that on a Spanish-language site claiming that the shrimp was caught in Spain. Before that it was supposedly hooked in Australia.
  Any number of stories have been made up to 'explain' the photo, which is suspect on any number of grounds, not the least of which is that if the critter actually did weigh 109 pounds it would take considerably more effort to hold it at arm's length than we see here (if you don't get what I mean, check out what it looks like when three guys are holding up a 109-pound catfish).
  For that matter, even if a shrimp did grow to be this huge, it wouldn't weigh 109 pounds, or even 50 pounds, or 25, or anywhere close to that. In a PBS News Hour segment about Asian tiger shrimp ( Penaeus monodon) , an invasive species found in greater and greater numbers in the Gulf of Mexico of late, it was reported that an extra-large specimen 'as long as a human forearm' might weigh as much as 11 ounces.
  Ounces, not pounds.
  To extrapolate, if you double that length — say, if the tiger shrimp measured twice as long as a human forearm — it might weigh 22 ounces, or around a pound-and-a-half.
  A shrimp three times the length of a human forearm — if such existed — could weigh a little over two pounds. At most.
  Given that the specimen in our photo looks to be about three feet in length, it's twice the size of any real shrimp ever caught (or would be, if real). In 2006, quite a fuss was made over a 16-inch-long black tiger shrimp caught off the coast of Colombia. In 2014, the Internet went gaga over an 18-inch-long mantis shrimp caught by someone fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce, Florida. Both were said by experts to be of 'record size.' I've found no reports of any non- prehistoric shrimp larger than those found anywhere on earth, ever.
  Given all the above, it's a foregone conclusion that the photo was manipulated. Never mind the preposterous weight attributed to the specimen, its physical dimensions betray the image as a hoax. The original snapshot must have shown the subject holding an ordinary fish of some kind. The'109-pound shrimp' was Photoshopped in after the fact, not only giving it an unreal appearance — it looks like the shrimp was cut and pasted in as an afterthought, doesn't it? — but degrading the overall quality of the image in the process.
  In July 2015 a 12-inch tiger shrimp was caught in the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. Local shrimpers claimed the larger shrimp that are increasingly showing up in Florida were farm-raised in North Carolina and escaped during Hurricane Hugo.
  In 2012 a foot-long tiger shrimp was caught off the coast of Louisiana. Scientists say the invasive species is on its way to becoming 'established' within 10 years and is most likely there to stay.
  In 2011 a ' giant tiger prawn ' was caught near Panama City, Florida ('tiger prawn' and 'tiger shrimp' seem to be used interchangeably in these media reports).
  The good news, for humans at any rate, is that they're both harmless and edible.

"Did NASA Predict 15 Days of Darkness in November?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/fl/15-Days-of-Darkness-Hoax.htm","'15 Days of Darkness' Hoax Won't Die","2015-10-11 05:34:50","  By David Emery
  Ignore social media reports claiming that NASA has signed off on a prediction that the earth will undergo 15 days of darkness in November 2015 due to an odd confluence of cosmic events. Nothing of the sort has been predicted by scientists.
  Variants of the fabricated story have been circulating since 2012 . The current version first appeared on the fake news website NewsWatch33.com , which makes its hay spoofing current events and recycling online hoaxes. The preposterous headlines on the front page of the site say everything you need to know, but if you're in need of further convincing check the disclaimer , which states — or rather understates — that a portion of the site's content is satirical.
  It appears to me to be 100% satirical, but in any case the fabricated content isn't marked as such, so the site is generally unreliable even there is a nugget or two of fact hidden on it.
  According to the article in question , NASA administrator Charles Bolden — who is a real person — presented the Obama administration with a 1,000-page report on the upcoming cosmic event.
  continue reading below our video
  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Here's an excerpt from NewsWatch33's summary of the alleged document:
  According to the report, on October 26, 2015, Venus and Jupiter will engage in a close parallelism, only being separated by 1 degree. Venus will pass to the southwest of Jupiter, causing Venus to shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. The light from Venus will heat up the gases on Jupiter causing a reaction.
  Codswallop. Planets don't 'engage in close parallelisms' — whatever that's supposed to mean. Astronomers do sometimes describe planets as being in ' conjunction ' — meaning that from an earthly vantage point the planets appear to move closer together in the sky from time to time as they orbit around the sun — but in reality the planets are never close enough together to affect one another physically.
  Venus and Jupiter are, on average, 416,399,477 miles apart.
  The claim that 'light from Venus will heat up the gases on Jupiter, causing a reaction' makes no sense, either. Venus isn't a light source; any light emanating from it would only be reflected light from the sun. No matter how close the two planets got, the light from Venus wouldn't be intense enough to cause atmospheric changes on Jupiter.
  'The gaseous reaction will release an unprecedented amount of Hydrogen into Space,' the next paragraph begins. Why are 'Hydrogen' and 'Space' capitalized in that sentence? I don't know. Might as well move on.
  Ultimately, the hydrogen from Jupiter is supposed to reach the sun, causing a massive explosion. Here's where it gets even more stupid: 'The sun will then attempt to cease the explosions by emitting heat from its core. The heat will cause the sun to dim [ sic ] to a bluish color.'
  Why would increased heat cause the sun to dim ? I don't know. Again, let's move on.
  Once the sun 'dims' to a 'bluish color,' supposedly, it will take 15 days for its surface to return to its normal 'Red Giant' temperature (never mind that astronomers classify the sun as a 'red dwarf' star, not a 'red giant'). During this two-week period the earth will remain in total darkness, we are told, yet, miraculously, the planet will suffer no ill effects apart from a six to eight degree increase [ sic ] in temperature.
  Charles Bolden of NASA is quoted in the article as saying the polar ice caps will not be 'majorly' affected by the event, about which 'No one should worry much.'
  <sarcasm> And that, of course, is exactly how NASA officials speak. </sarcasm>

  A viral fake news story originally published on the satirical website Huzlers.com claimed that AriZona Tea and other products manufactured by the Arizona Beverage Company contain human urine as an 'active ingredient.' The FDA has supposedly ordered it removed from store shelves. This was false, fabricated as an attempt at humor and satire.
  Example #1: Via Huzlers.com, April 19, 2015:
  AriZona Tea Exposed By FDA For Using Human Urine In Products; Will Be Taken Off Shelves
  NEW YORK — Popular American tea company AriZona has been reportedly discovered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be using Human Urine in their products as an active ingredient.
  Upon being unexpectedly inspected a few days ago, FDA inspectors visited five of AriZona's biggest factories in the United States and what they discovered was shocking. They discovered thousands and thousands of gallons of large industrial containers containing human urine.

  I just read that Arizona Tea won't be sold anymore. The Food and Drug Administration found human urine in there tea. Eewww!!
  Example #3: Via Twitter, April 29, 2015:
  I found out that Arizona tea has been putting human urine in their drinks this whole time... My life has been a nasty lie
  This hogwash originated as a fake news article on Huzlers.com , a website that describes itself as 'the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website with the most shocking headlines and articles.'
  It also boasts the most misspellings and grammatical errors of any website of its kind. Hard as it may be to believe that anyone could mistake this stuff for actual news, some people do. Unfortnately, many read only headlines on Facebook and other social media and then share posts with friends without checking the source.
  The basic premise of the story — that a bodily fluid (in this case, urine) has been found to be a secret ingredient in a popular, commercially sold beverage — is a familiar one. A rumor dating from the early 2000s holds that Red Bull and other popular energy drinks derive their energy-enhancing powers from the addition of bull semen or bull urine to the basic recipe, for example. Going back even further in time to the late 1980s, the scuttlebutt among beer drinkers was that Corona, the extra-foamy, bright yellow lager imported from Mexico and sold in clear glass bottles, was contaminated with the urine of brewery workers . Neither of these rumors proved to have any basis in fact.
  The allegations about AriZona Tea are also reminiscent of viral alerts that date back several years warning that an HIV-positive worker purposely contaminated products in a Pepsi-Cola (or similarly high-profile) soft drink plant with his own blood, thereby exposing consumers to the AIDS virus. Despite claims that these alerts were issued by governmental authorities, they did not come from any official sources, nor, as far as anyone knows, were they based on actual incidents. According to the CDC , the AIDS virus doesn't live long enough outside the human body to make transmission via food or beverage practicable. In any case, the experts say, even if a bit of the live virus were consumed this way it would be destroyed by digestive acids in the stomach before infection could occur.

"'Scary Way to Break Up' Chain Letter Haunts the Internet","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/internet-scares/fl/A-Scary-Way-to-Break-Up.htm","A Scary Way to Break Up","2015-04-27 20:10:35","  By David Emery
  This oft-shared Internet chain letter tells the story of a teenage break-up gone horribly, horribly wrong. Heartless boyfriend Jason called sensitive girlfriend Sarah some awful names when he broke up with her, and wound up with his throat slashed in the shower. Repost within 13 minutes or die!
  Example:
  A SCARY WAY TO BREAK UP!!!!!
  DO NOT stop reading this or something bad will happen!!!!!!!!
  One day, Sarah was walking home from school when her boyfriend drove by and honked at her to get in. She got in his car and he drove her to the lake. Her boyfriend said he was going to tell her something very important.
  Sarah could have sworn he was going to propose. However, he flicked her off, pushed her in the lake and yelled, “I am breaking up with you, you awful ..........!! I hate you and I think that maybe you should just end your ........... life! DUMB ...........!!!”
  He laughed and drove off. It was a very cold day. Sarah climbed out of the lake, freezing cold, and feeling the worst she had in her entire life. She got home went in a hot bath, and slit her wrists and died in the bathtub.
  Her parents yelled and screamed at her to get out until they finally broke the door down. They saw no body, but the entire bathroom was dripping with her blood. Her mom went insane and killed herself three days later, her dad is in prison, accused of murder.
  Later that week, Sarah’s ex boyfriend was taking a shower when she came from the drain, rotting and bloody, with a razor in her hand and said “Goodbye Jason.” She cut his throat before he could scream.
  If you do not repost this with the title “1 scary way to break up”, you are a heartless ........... and Sarah come to you in the shower from the drain, and will kill you the same way she killed her boyfriend. 24 ppl have broken this chain and died
  You have 13 minutes
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: Like Carmen Winstead , A Little Girl Called Clarissa , and others of its ilk, this chain letter is a ghost story and cautionary tale combined — the better to persuade recipients to pass it along.
  Sarah was so distraught after her boyfriend Jason broke up with her, we're told, that she killed herself. Not only did her vengeful ghost emerge from the shower drain and slash Jason's throat with a razor, but she'll do the same to you and me if we fail to share the story within 13 minutes of reading it!
  It doesn't make much sense, I'll grant you, but the ploy has been successful. 'A Scary Way to Break Up' has been copied and pasted thousands of times since it first appeared on the Internet five or so years ago. Needless to say, the story isn't true. Regardless of its content, the main purpose of a chain letter — any chain letter — is reproduction. The bogus claim that 24 people have died because they 'broke the chain' is a standard scare tactic.
  There's nothing supernatural at work in texts like this. No one has ever died because they didn't repost a chain letter. Anyone with first-person proof to the contrary is welcome to correct me from beyond the grave!

"What's the Charlie Charlie Challenge, and Why Is It Freaking People Out?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/Charlie-Charlie-Challenge.htm","What's the Charlie Charlie Challenge, and Why Is It Freaking People Out?","2015-05-29 01:54:19","  You never know when you might need to contact a demon , right? But what's the best way to do that? Don't worry, Twitter will show you how. Just search for tweets using the hashtag '#CharlieCharlieChallenge' and gain access to literally thousands of Vines and YouTube videos demonstrating a simple procedure for interacting with an alleged 'Mexican demon' by the name of Charlie.
  Here's the Charlie Charlie Challenge in a nutshell:
  1. Take a sheet of paper and draw two lines, one horizontal and the vertical, to form a simple cross.
  2. Write the word 'YES' in two of the diagonally opposing quadrants thus formed, and the word 'NO' in the remaining two.
  3. Place one ordinary pencil over the horizontal line, and balance another vertically on top of it, again forming a simple cross.
  4. Ask a yes-or-no question. 'Charlie, Charlie, are you there?' for example. Or, 'Charlie, Charlie, can you come out to play?'
  5. Wait for it. If Charlie is present, the top pencil will rotate to reveal his answer.
  Make sure you say goodbye
  The reactions of those videoed performing the challenge range from nervous giggles to outbursts of profanity to uncontrollable shrieks before dashing out of the room. They've clearly bought into the demonic scenario described in this viral Tumblr post:
  That's all rather scary if taken at face value, but is any of it true? Take the claim that the 'Charlie Charlie' game is Mexican in origin. According to BBC Mundo correspondent Maria Elena Navez, it is not. 'Mexican legends often come from ancient Aztec and Maya history, or from the many beliefs that began circulating during the Spanish conquest,' Navez is quoted as saying on BBC.com .
  'In Mexican mythology you can find gods with names like 'Tlaltecuhtli' or 'Tezcatlipoca' in the Nahuatl language. But if this legend began after the Spanish conquest, I'm sure it would've been called 'Carlitos' (Charlie in Spanish).'
  She's right. I've not found any references in texts on Mexican folklore to a demon named Charlie (or Carlitos), or traditional games or rituals involving the summoning of said demon. Some of the online videos feature people speaking in Spanish, and in a few of those the name 'La Llorona' (from the famed Mexican ghost story) is invoked instead of 'Charlie,' but that doesn't make the pencil ritual a 'Mexican tradition.'
  An 'old' tradition by Internet standards only
  The oldest mention I've found of anything resembling the Charlie Charlie Challenge was a question posted on Yahoo! Answers in 2008:
  Note that in the above variant six pencils (or pens, or markers) are called for, and the players hold them in their hands instead of laying them crosswise on a sheet of paper ( a 2014 video shows two kids playing that version of the game).
  The oldest video I've found is dated September 26, 2008 and features the more familiar version of the game, though the name 'Charlie' is never uttered in it.
  Demons or physics?
  So, why does the pencil move? Is it a demon or someone else trying to make contact from 'the spirit world,' or can the phenomenon be explained in more ordinary terms? It's easily the latter. For one thing, the pencil doesn't always move. When it does move, it could be caused by a slight breeze, someone breathing or blowing on it, or the mere fact that one pencil is balanced so precariously on top of the other in the first place.
  As in any case where science can sufficiently explain why a phenomenon occurs, there's no reason to assume supernatural forces are at work.

"10 Things to Know About Slender Man","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/tp/10-Things-to-Know-About-Slender-Man.htm","10 Things to Know About Slender Man","2014-10-21 18:58:23","  By David Emery
  He's one of the most talked-about online phenomena , and for good reason — Slender Man is one scary dude, a dread-inspiring boogeyman for the digital age. He has at least half a dozen nicknames, including 'Slendy,' 'The Tall Man,' Mr. Slim,' 'Daddy Longlegs,' and 'The Operator.' The chatter started in 2009, when mysterious photos started going around showing a creepy, ghostly figure clothed in black stalking children in schoolyards and playgrounds. It was rumored that the people who took the photographs were never seen or heard from again. Their disappearances were blamed on Slender Man, as were those of many missing children, and even some adults, all over the world.
  continue reading below our video
  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  You'll know Slender Man when you see him. He's gaunt, stands eight to ten feet tall, and instead of arms and hands has multiple, writhing tentacles that come to razor-sharp points (the better to skewer his victims!). Creepiest of all, they say Slender Man doesn't have a face. In photographs and drawings his face is rendered either completely featureless and blank — a fuzzy, amorphous blob — or wrapped in gauze like a mummy.
  Slendy's sartorial trademark is a black suit, and in some photographs he's even shown wearing a necktie! Apart from that single detail — the necktie — Slender Man's wardrobe rarely varies in physical depictions of him. To recap what you should be on the lookout for: an eight-to-ten-foot-tall faceless man with tentacles for arms, impeccably dressed in a neat black suit and tie. There's no mistaking him for anyone else!
  Slender Man sightings go all the way back to the 1500s, according to websites documenting the Slender Man 'mythos.' They cite 16th-century woodcut prints of a creature known in Germany as Der Großmann ('The Tall Man'), a skeletal figure with multiple legs and spear-like arms depicted in the act of impaling adults and/or stealing their children. Quoted sources describe Der Großmann as an 'evil fairy' who lives in the Black Forest and hunts down 'bad children' foolish enough to venture there alone.
  'Slender Man has links to many Proxies , or insane individuals under its control or influence,' reports the Slender Man Wiki, a repository of information about Slendy and his mythos (which includes various role-playing games). 'It is suspected that Proxies do the actual, physical work for Slender Man, such as creating and manipulating objects, destroying and leaving evidence, creating videos and responding on Twitter, and influencing victims as needed.'
  In two separate incidents, adolescent girls were accused of knife attacks allegedly inspired by stories they read about Slender Man online. The first, on May 31, 2014, involved two 12-year-old girls who stabbed a classmate in Waukesha, Wisconsin. They told police the attack was meant to 'impress' Slender Man so they could become his Proxies. A few weeks later,, a 13-year-old Ohio girl 'obsessed with Slender Man' attacked her own mother with a knife, causing minor injuries. The girl in the second attack was described by her mother as having 'mental health issues,' and at least one of the perpetrators in the first attack was ruled mentally incompetent for trial.
  This bears repeating: Slender Man doesn't exist! He's an invented character , a fictional boogeyman in a crowdsourced horror story. Apart from the real-life stabbing incidents attributed to some kids' obsession with Slender Man lore, everything you've read about him was completely made up. The character was created from scratch by participants in an online Photoshop contest in 2009, and enthusiasts have been adding to the 'mythos' ever since. Even Slender Man's supposed historical predecessor, Der Großmann, is a Photoshop creation (the 'woodcuts' of him were created by altering original prints by famed 16th-century artist Hans Holbein).
  Slender Man isn't real. He's an Internet urban legend. Don't let him scare you!

"Did a 600-Pound Woman Give Birth to a 40-Pound Baby?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/600-Pound-Woman-Gives-Birth.htm","Did a 600-Pound Woman Give Birth to a 40-Pound Baby?","2015-01-19 20:27:14","  Description: Fake news / Satire Circulating since: Jan. 2015 Status: False (details below)
  Example: Via World News Daily Report, January 14, 2015:
  Australia: 600-Pound Woman Gives Birth to 40-Pound Baby
  Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perth’s King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning.
  The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: First things first. This story originated on a satirical website called World News Daily Report . Like everything else on the site, it's BS, not meant to be taken seriously.
  One dead giveaway is the attribution of the report to a newspaper called the ' Western Australian Herald .' No such newspaper exists. Moreover, no actual Australian newspapers have published such an item. Not one.
  During the process of fact-checking these claims I did run across one other story about a morbidly obese woman giving birth to an impossibly large baby. Written in much the same spirit as the spoof above, it was printed more than 10 years ago in the infamous supermarket tabloid, the Weekly World News .
  Here's an excerpt for your enjoyment:
  Porky plus-size supermodel Catherine Bergley tips the scales at a staggering 500 pounds -- and the mammoth mom just gave birth to a 40-pound baby, setting a new world record!
  Humungous Elvis Bergley, delivered by C-section at 7:32 a.m. on Sept. 14, bounced into the world already weighing more than an average 4-year-old boy, say astonished doctors in Wellington, New Zealand.
  'Elvis' birth weight is about six times that of the average newborn,' declares Dr. Henry Cleric, the obstetrician who delivered the titanic tyke.
  'He'd dwarf a polar bear cub and give a newborn elephant a run for its money.'
  The reality is that no 40-pound human birth, or anything close to it, has ever been recorded. The world record for heaviest birth is held by a 22-pound infant (known only as 'Babe' because he died 11 hours after delivery) born to giantess Anna Haining Bates on January 19, 1879. One needn't be a giant to give birth to a giant baby, however. The record for the heaviest surviving birth was set by a 22-pound baby boy born to Carmelina Fedele of Aversa, Italy in 1955.
  According to About.com pediatrics expert Dr. Vincent Iannelli, the average weight of infants born in the U.S. is 7 lbs., 7.5 oz. Any birth weight between 5 lbs., 8 oz. and 8 lbs., 13 oz. is considered normal.
  A birth weight of 40 lbs. is pure science fiction.

  Bill Gates Offers Young Thug $9,000,000 Cash To Stop Making Music; Read What Gates Had To Say
  ATLANTA - It is being reported that Multi-Billionaire Microsoft Founder Bill Gates has offered Atlanta Rapper Young Thug 9 Million dollars cash to stop making music.
  Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffrey Williams, is known for his eccentric style of rap and making random noises in his music. Bill Gates has told reporters 'I may not be an avid rap listener but i sure heard Young Thug’s music and instantly went into depression. I even began to question my existence and why this man was even let 100 feet near a recording studio, he has to go, If he denies my offer, I will offer even more'. Young Thug has yet to reply to the offer.

  Analysis: Rubbish. It's doubtful Microsoft founder Bill Gates has ever heard a Young Thug recording, much less come to hate the Atlanta rapper's music so much that he would offer him $9 million to quit the business.

"The Terrifying Tale of Bunny Man Bridge","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/murderers/fl/Bunny-Man-Bridge.htm","What's So Scary About Bunny Man Bridge?","2015-01-29 20:59:58","  By David Emery
  On Colchester Road in Fairfax County, Virginia , just outside the small town of Clifton , stands an unlikely tourist destination known officially as Colchester Overpass , unofficially as Bunny Man Bridge .
  To outward appearances there's nothing remarkable about the site, which consists of a one-lane concrete tunnel beneath a railroad track. What draws people to it, despite the fact that tourism is discouraged by local authorities , are the tales of mayhem and murder told about the place. What draws people to it is the Legend of the Bunny Man .
  The details vary in the telling, but there are two basic versions of the story. One begins with the closure of a nearby insane asylum, from which a busload of inmates were being transferred to another institution when two of the most dangerous escaped and hid in the woods. Despite a manhunt they eluded authorities for weeks, leaving the half-eaten carcasses of rabbits in their wake. Eventually one of them was found dead, hanging from the overpass.

  The other escapee, now dubbed 'the bunny man,' or simply 'Bunnyman,' was never found. Some say he was struck and killed by a passing train and his ghost continues to haunt the overpass to this day, killing and mutilating innocent passersby.
  The other version begins with a deranged teenager who one day donned a white bunny costume, murdered his entire family, then hung himself from the overpass. It's his spirit that haunts the bridge, chasing down visitors with his ax and disemboweling them. All told, some 32 people have supposedly died there.
  Bunny Man sightings have been reported in other locales as well, not only in Fairfax County but also in rural Maryland and the District of Columbia. When not committing outright murder, he is said to have chased children with his ax, attacked adults in their cars, and vandalized property.
  So, is the Bunny Man real? No — not the Bunny Man of legend, at any rate.
  No insane asylum has ever existed in or near Clifton, Virginia. That's according to archivist and historian Brian A. Conley, who extensively researched the Bunny Man stories for the Fairfax County Public Library. Nor is there any record of a local teenager murdering his family. No one has ever hung himself on Bunny Man Bridge, nor have any homicides occurred there. Like others who have attempted to verify these tales, Conley concluded they're false. 'In short,' he wrote, 'the Bunny Man did not exist.'
  However...
  On October 22, 1970, a curious story appeared in the Washington Post under the headline, 'Man in Bunny Suit Sought in Fairfax.' According to the report, a young man and his fiancee were sitting in his car in the 5400 block of Guinea Road — approximately seven miles due east of the Colchester Overpass — when they were accosted by a man 'dressed in a white suit with long bunny ears.' After complaining that they were trespassing, he threw a wooden-handled hatchet through the right front car window and 'skipped off into the night,' the article said.
  Just over a week later, the ax-man with bunny ears was spotted again about a block away from where the first sighting had occurred. This time he was standing on the porch of a newly constructed house, hacking away at a roof support.
  Here's how it was reported in the Washington Post :
  Paul Phillips, a private security guard for a construction company, said he saw the 'rabbit' standing on the front porch of a new, but unoccupied house. 'I started talking to him,' Phillips said, 'and that's when he started chopping.'
  'All you people trespass around here,' Phillips said the 'Rabbit' told him as he whacked eight gashes in the pole. 'If you don't get out of here, I'm going to bust you on the head.' Phillips said he walked back to his car to get to get his handgun, but the 'Rabbit,' carrying the long-handled ax, ran off into the woods.
  The mysterious 'Rabbit' of Guinea Road was never identified, caught, or questioned, nor was he ever seen again, so far as anyone knows, but there are good reasons to suppose that these sightings formed the genesis of the Bunny Man legend. Not only did the incidents occur in Fairfax County not far from the Colchester Overpass, not only did the perpetrator allegedly threaten people with an ax while dressed in a bunny costume, but these reports were published in 1970, almost exactly the same time the earliest known variants of the story began to appear.
  So, yes, the real-life events of some forty-odd years ago served as the basis for this tale, but the rest — not least any supposed connection between the Bunny Man and his namesake bridge — is pure embellishment. That's how a legend is made.

"Can This 'Suggestive' 1930s Mickey Mouse Milk Ad Possibly Be Real?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humo1/ss/Mickey-Mouse-Milk-Ad.htm","Is This 'Suggestive' Mickey Mouse Milk Ad Real?","2015-02-17 19:13:03","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: 2011 (or earlier) Status: Fake
  Analysis: This image has been circulating for several years and crops up frequently on sites like Pinterest and Reddit. The earliest post I've found is a Sept. 29, 2011 entry on Boing Boing describing the pictured advertisement as 'a relic of olde-world naiveté.'
  The ad copy reads as follows:
  'Outside of you, Mickey — that milk is the best thing in the world!' enthuses a grinning Minnie Mouse while pointing to a giant bottle of Grand Rapids Creamery milk.
  'INSIDE of you, Minnie,' Mickey Mouse responds, 'my milk is the best thing in the world!'
  It's not wholly implausible that such a risqué ad, whether intentionally suggestive or not, could have been published in some more naive era — say, the 1930s — nor that the innuendo that makes it so funny to us now could have gone right over the heads of its intended audience. We've seen examples of this before .
  Moreover, a milk company called Grand Rapids Creamery really did exist, and published a monthly promotional comic book during the mid-1930s using Disney characters to advertise its products. An ad almost identical to the one pictured above appeared in the June 1934 issue of Grand Rapids Creamery's Mickey Mouse Magazine , but here's the thing. In the original ad copy Mickey Mouse didn't say, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, my milk is the best thing in the world!' What he actually said, more accurately mirroring Minnie's words, was, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, that milk is the best thing in the world!'
  In short, the text in the viral version has been altered to yield a verbal double entendre that didn't exist in the original. Don't feel bad if you were fooled by it. So was BuzzFeed writer Brian Galindo , not to mention E! Online correspondent John Boone , who wrote: 'Maybe it's just an innocent little double entendre that the ad agency thought was clever and — wink wink — a little bit naughty, do you get it?' The Photoshop job was so convincing that it was included in a Nov. 21, 2012 Cracked.com feature, ' 6 Retro Ads With Accidental Sexual Innuendos .'
  Turns out it was an example of new world, not 'olde world,' naiveté.
  The Walt Disney Company, Disneyland and Disney cartoon characters have been the subjects of many urban legends and online hoaxes over the years. One recent hoax falsely claimed that Harry Potter actress Emma Watson is set to star in a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid . Another used doctored images to demonstrate an ' amazing likeness ' between photos of Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding to Disney's 1950 animated classic, Cinderella . And then, of course, there's the classic urban legend claiming that when Walt Disney died in 1966 his body was cryogenically frozen and preserved for future revival at a secret location in Disneyland. Not true. His body was cremated, in accordance with his wishes.

"This Girl Literally Wore a 'Killer Dress'","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Poison-Dress.htm","The Poison Dress","2015-01-31 18:34:48","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Poisoned Dress,' 'Embalmed Alive,' and 'Dressed to Kill'
  Example: Submitted by a reader, March 1999...
  I remember what I consider to be an urban legend that circulated when I was younger, always around prom time. If I remember correctly, it was about a girl who wanted to go to the prom, but she was very poor. Well, she decided to save some money and go to the pawn shop and buy a secondhand dress. She bought a beautiful blue dress, went to the prom and had a wonderful time. The next day, her mom found her dead in her bed. When the doctors examined her, they found traces of embalming fluid in her body that had soaked through her pores when she danced. They went to the pawn shop and found that the dress had come from an undertaker's assistant who had stolen the dress of a corpse and hocked it for money.
  Example: From the Indiana State University Folklore Archives, 1970...
  This lady died, and she wasn't very old. A couple of her sisters went out to buy a dress to bury her in, and they couldn't decide between this yellow one or the purple one, so they took both of them with them to get approval from the rest of the family. They left both the dresses at the funeral home and later decided on the purple one, so they called the undertaker. I don't know if the undertaker didn't understand, but he had the yellow dress on her the next morning when the family came in. They told him about the mistake, and he exchanged the dresses, and they returned the yellow one to the store. A few days later a girl bought the yellow dress and wore it to a dance. During the dance she began sweating because the place was really full. After a few minutes she dropped dead. The stuff the undertaker had used had been so thick on the dress that it had killed her.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: Sometimes it's a blue dress, sometimes a yellow one, sometimes the crux of the narrative is a white wedding dress. The particulars vary but the denouement is always the same: a woman dies, poisoned by her own dress, a secondhand garment whose previous wearer had been a corpse.
  Folks have been telling the story since the 1930s, though the 'poisoned clothing' motif dates back much further -- to ancient Greece, in fact, and the myth of Medea . As it was told by the Greek playwright Euripides in the 5th century B.C., the 'witch goddess' Medea murdered Glauce, her rival for Jason's hand, by presenting her with a poisoned dress as a wedding gift. The dress burned Glauce alive (see also: Hercules and the robe of Nessus ).
  Inasmuch as the modern tale hinges on the supposed deadliness of physical contact with embalming fluid (or straight formaldehyde, in some variants), folklorists have long regarded it as apocryphal. 'As for the threat of real embalming fluid,' Jan Harold Brunvand wrote in a 1992 analysis of the legend, 'I once heard from a journalist who had asked a mortician about this point in the story. The mortician opened a bottle of the fluid and splashed some over his own face, saying, 'Does this answer your question?'' According to safety information provided by manufacturers, prolonged skin contact with embalming fluid may cause 'irritation in hypersensitive individuals,' but not death.
  Some commentators have pointed out that early variants of the story name specific department stores at which the tainted dress was supposedly purchased, concluding that its original purpose may have been to malign particular businesses. Not that I find this implausible, but I wonder if it doesn't miss the point.
  The place of purchase varies in the telling, as do the type and color of the dress, the nature of the occasion for which it's bought, and the specific chemical(s) it's allegedly contaminated with. What doesn't vary are the claims that 1) the dress had been previously worn by a corpse, and 2) the next person to wear it wound up equally dead.
  I believe this story expresses, above all, a fundamental horror of death itself, which is why we're still sharing it some eighty years after it was first told.

  Excerpt: Via NBCToday.co, Dec. 28, 2014:
  BREAKING: Playboy Tycoon Hugh Hefner Passes Away at Age of 88
  Hugh Hefner, Founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, was found dead of natural causes Sunday morning at his home, the Playboy Mansion, in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to Los Angeles police officer Jimmy N. Gardner. He was 88.
  Police responded to a call around 9 a.m. PDT and confirmed Hefner's identity from other residents of the Playboy Mansion, Gardner said. Police are not releasing a more specific cause of death at this time. 'We'll have to wait for an autopsy report for an official cause of death,' said Gardner. 'From what I have heard Mr. Hefner was in good health for an 88 year old man. With no signs of foul-play we are left to believe his death was of natural causes.'
  Hefner's long publication career first began as a copywriter for Esquire, which was cut short in 1952 after being denied a $5 raise. Less than a year later, after mortgaging his furniture and generating loans from everywhere from banks to even his mother, Hefner launched Playboy. The racy magazine was nearly a hit from its first issue published in December 1953, which featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: How dubious is the above article claiming that Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner died in December 2014?
  Let me count the ways:
  1. Its source, an untitled website with the URL NBCToday.co , contains no other content and no contact information. The domain name was registered anonymously just five days before the article was published. NBCToday.co is not connected with NBC News or any other National Broadcasting Company property in any way.
  2. The article is poorly written and badly in need of copy editing. No legitimate news organization would have published it.
  3. Speaking of legitimate news organizations, as of December 29, 2014 — one day after the NBCToday.co article appeared — none had reported that Hefner was dead. In fact, several sources, including the ones linked below, had already debunked the false claim:
  • Snopes.com: The Death of Hef? • The Mirror : Hugh Hefner Is NOT Dead • The Independent : Hugh Hefner Is Not Dead • Fox News Radio: Hugh Hefner Alive at 88 • HollywoodLife Daily: Hugh Hefner Dead?
  4. As each of those sources pointed out, Hefner himself was actually among the first to disprove the rumor by retweeting a family photo taken at roughly the same time the hoax was unleashed on the evening of December 28.
  5. Not only are celebrity death hoaxes extremely common on the Internet, Hugh Hefner has been the victim of similar pranks in the past. In July 2011, for example, stories circulated via the web and social media claiming that Hefner had succumbed to a heart attack. The reports were quickly proven false. 'I'm happy to see how many people are pleased that I'm not dead,' Hefner famously tweeted on that occasion. 'I'm pleased too.'

"You Better Watch Out, You Better Not Cry...","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/christmaslore/tp/Santas-Scariest-Helpers.htm","The Top 5 Scariest Christmas Monsters","2014-12-25 01:37:37","  By David Emery
  If you were raised in England or America, you likely grew up thinking of Christmas as a warm, cheery affair culminating in the opening of presents delivered by a jolly, fat elf named Santa Claus. You may have also been told that Santa keeps a 'naughty or nice' list and that misbehaving children get lumps of coal for Christmas instead of gifts, but you knew in your heart these were hollow threats. Santa, after all, is the nicest guy on earth. Christmas is no time for meting out punishment.
  Not so if you grew up in certain parts of Europe where a considerably darker tradition holds sway. In the folklore of Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other European countries, Santa is accompanied by scary henchmen whose sole mission is to punish unruly children and terrify them into submission. If you've been nice, there's nothing to worry about. If you've been naughty, you'd better be prepared for a whipping — or worse!
  With his goat horns, cloven hooves, and snake-like tongue, Krampus resembles nothing so much as the devil himself, which is precisely how children in central and eastern European countries think of him. Described by one 19th-century source as 'the terror of the nursery,' Krampus is usually depicted carrying a bundle of switches, the better to flog misbehaving youngsters.
  In Alpine countries the eve of the Feast of St. Nicholas (December 6) is known as Krampusnacht (Krampus Night), on which the Christmas devil himself supposedly roams and drunken celebrants take to the streets wearing Krampus costumes and threatening passersby with whips and chains.
  According to folklore, Krampus accompanies St. Nicholas as he goes from house to house with his bag of gifts. There is a knock at the door, and there stands kind 'Nicolo.' Behind him stands the not-so-kind Krampus. Each child in the house is called forward to account for his or her behavior:
  Nicolo asks the most awkward questions, such as: 'Who stole his sister's sweets last week?' 'Who broke her brother's boat??' WHen all the questions are answer, the good children receive presents, but naughty boys and girls do not get anything from Nicolo; instead of a puzzle-box, a ball, a new knife, or a doll, they get a gift from the Krampus, and the Krampus only gives one kind of present — a birch-rod. ( Chatterbox , 1905 )
  Are you ready for your Christmas interrogation?

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  in French-speaking countries St. Nicholas is known as Père Noël (Father Christmas). His sinister opposite number is Père Fouettard (Father Whipper or Father Spanker), a shaggy wild man who beats naughty children on St. Nicholas' Day. He's usually depicted wearing a long, black beard and hooded robe, carrying a whip or a handful of birch rods.
  According to legend, Père Fouettard was an unscrupulous innkeeper (or butcher, in some versions) who murdered three young children and planned to carve up their corpses to sell as meat. His plan was foiled by St. Nicholas, who resurrected the children and made Père Fouettard his minion. It may seem strange to assign the job of punishing the naughty to a known child killer, but such is the logic of folklore.
  Grýla , a giant ogress who is said to live in the mountains of Iceland, descends from her hideaway every Christmas to hunt down misbehaving children in the cities and towns and eat them. She's likely to be accompanied not only by her gargantuan feline companion, the Yule Cat -- who has a similar taste for the flesh of children, particularly those who weren't given new clothes for Christmas -- but also by her 13 sons, the mischievous Yule Lads .
  Traditionally, Icelandic children place a shoe in their bedroom window each of the 13 nights before Christmas and check the next morning to see what each of the Yule Lads, consecutively has left in the shoe. If he or she was nice the previous day, the child receives a gift; if naughty, a rotten potato. Nobody wants to find a smelly potato in their shoe, but it's a better outcome than being eaten by an ogress, that's for sure.
  'The custom is wide-spread among the country people throughout the whole north of Germany,' Benjamin Thorpe's 1852 volume called Northern Mythology informs us, 'of having a man on Christmas Eve to enter the apartment, disguised with a long beard, and enveloped either in fur or in pea-straw, who asks the children whether they can pray, and, if they stand the trial, rewards them with apples, nuts and gingerbread (pepper-cakes); and, on the other hand, punishes those that have learned nothing.'
  This character's name is Knecht Ruprecht. In the folktales told of him, Ruprecht carries a long staff and a bag of ashes with which he beats the reprobate children who haven't learned to pray.
  Frau Perchta (or Berchta), aka 'the belly-splitter,' is another character from Germanic mythology who may not have originally been associated with Christmas but who is now thought of by Austrian children as a Yuletide terror. Why? Because if you've misbehaved, this hideous witch will visit your house during the 12 days of Christmas, rip your guts out, and stuff your belly with bricks, firewood, or whatever else may be at hand.
  True, the legends about Frau Perchta also say she can appear among mortals as a great beauty, and if you've been good she'll give you candy instead of cutting you open with her knife, but who among us is so well behaved we needn't fear the worst?

  Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34
  Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.
  At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man's identity at this time.
  'The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,' said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.
  Born August 26, 1980, Culkin began acting at the tender age of four. At the height of his fame, he was regarded as the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple.
  This story is still developing. More details will be made available once they emerge.
  Analysis: False. Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin has not been reported dead by any official agencies or legitimate media sources. Despite the fact that it originated on a web page with the URL 'http://msnbc.website,' it's neither an actual news site nor does it have any connection with MSNBC News . According to its WHOIS listing , the domain name was registered barely a week before the article was published. Its owner has chosen to remain anonymous.
  Portions of the text were copied verbatim from a previous hoax declaring that '80s 'Brat Pack' actor Judd Nelson was found dead in his Los Angeles condo.
  Nota bene: MediaMass.net is also a hoax
  Some venues are inaccurately reporting that the source of the Culkin death hoax was a Facebook page 'with over one million likes' proclaiming that 'our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.' In point of fact, no such Facebook page exists, or existed. The erroneous reports are based on misinformation purveyed by yet another fake news website called MediaMass.net , which maintains scores of virtually identical pages pre-emptively debunking celebrity death hoaxes.
  For example, the copy on the ' Macaulay Culkin Dead 2014 ' page on MediaMass.net reads as follows:
  Macaulay Culkin death hoax spreads on Facebook
  Rumors of the actor’s alleged demise gained traction on Thursday after a ‘ R.I.P. Macaulay Culkin ’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American actor’s passing:

  Example: Excerpt from Universalnoticias.org, Nov. 1, 2014:
  GABRIEL IGLESIAS FOUND DEAD, NOT CONFIRMED BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A HEALTH COMPLICATION.
  Gabriel Iglesias was one of the best standup comedians in the world. His constant touring garnered him international fame and his observational comedy and impressionism provided great comedy gags for the fans. Iglesias’s signature-style Hawaiian t-shirts, jokes about obesity and the smooth story-telling have won him millions of fans. He won numerous awards and accolades, including the key to the city of El Paso. Hector Saldaña dubbed him a “comedy genius.” Funny, charismatic, a people person, the best comedian around were just a few of his many qualities.
  Gabriel Iglesias,  (born July 15, 1976) known profesionally  as Gabriel Iglesias and comically as Fluffy died this Friday for causes that are still not confirmed but it seems to be a health complication. He has four sisters and one brother.
  Analysis: Completely false. Comedian Gabriel 'Fluffy' Iglesias is alive and well and has been actively responding to this hoax via Facebook and Twitter.
  'Seriously?! I must be doing good in life,' Iglesias tweeted the day after the above article went viral. 'More fake #FluffyDied shit popping up.'
  A few hours later he wrote on his Facebook page :
  According to this article below I guess I died Friday and no one decided to tell me. Well, since I'm dead now I guess I can start eating carbs again. It was a good life. Had a great childhood and an amazing career. I traveled the world and got drunk in all 50 states, woooooo! I made a lot of people happy over the years and pissed off most my ex girlfriends in the process. Can't win them all, right? Soooo I guess I want to be buried somewhere people can visit my grave, put pretty flowers and pour diet cokes on my plot. I'm gonna want my estate to buy both plots next to me so that even in death I can stretch my legs. I would love it very much if people were to visit my grave and take selfies with it. Even in death I'm still a social media attention whore, #FarewellFluffy . There should be no charge to visit my grave so don't pay any attention to the shady guy by the gate with the comedy club passes in the new Jaguar trying to raise money by selling tickets to get in the cemetery. U just tell him to go fund himself and he will leave u alone.
  Source of the story was a fake news website
  The hoax originally appeared November 1, 2014 on the fake news website Universalnoticias.org (now deleted), which explained its rather unusual mission as follows (translated from the Spanish by Google):
  The content of this page is not real, it's just a social experiment performed by Canadian students currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching for education in developing countries.
  The experiment attempts to collect vital data that may provide information on the relationship between Third World countries and the content they read. People living in the richest and most powerful countries in the world, tend to read at an early age, culture articles, historical, political, investment articles, health articles in all high value that enriches and humans, these items are the 'good' question. People living in poor countries mostly prefer reading things celebrities, religious articles, cartoons, novels, and her favorite shows are reality shows, these items are considered 'junk'.
  Our experiment is to obtain data items considered good, and comparing the number of visitors compared to trash items.
  By 'trash items' the authors presumably mean articles such as this one falsely declaring Mr. Iglesias dead. We look forward to viewing the results of their 'experiment.' (UPDATE: Apparently the experiment is over. Not long after the article went viral, the entire website was deleted.)

"Judd Nelson Death Report Is a Hoax","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Judd-Nelson-Dead-Hoax.htm","Report of Judd Nelson's Death Is a Hoax","2014-10-26 20:40:15","  Description: Fake news / Hoax Circulating since: Oct. 2014 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: As published on Foxnews.es, Oct. 26, 2014:
  BREAKING: 'Brat Pack' Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo
  Last Updated: 10/26/2014 @ 01:36 AM EST
  BREAKING NEWS: Sources are reporting that Judd Nelson, best known for his roles as John Bender in The Breakfast Club, has been found dead at age 55.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.
  Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.
  The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.
  Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term 'Brat Pack' being coined.
  In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.
  Additional details and information will be updated as it becomes available. This story is still developing.
  Analysis: Judd Nelson is alive and well according to his Hollywood agent Gregg Klein, who not only denied Internet reports of the actor's death on October 26, 2014 but provided a photo of Nelson holding a copy of that day's edition of the Los Angeles Times as proof.
  A fake news story (see screen shot above) claiming Nelson was found dead of unknown causes in his L.A. condo was published on the website foxnews.es, which has no discernible connection to the Fox News channel or FoxNews.com, and no other content aside from this hoax. According to the site's WHOIS record , the domain name is registered to a Uvalde, Texas resident named Fred Post. (Update: that domain name is now for sale.)

"Have Giant Mutant Spiders Been Discovered in Missouri?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/spiders/fl/Giant-Spiders-Released-from-DNA-Laboratory.htm","Giant Spiders Released from DNA Lab in Missouri? No, It' a Hoax!","2014-09-16 00:55:46","  By David Emery
  Description: Viral images / Text Circulating since: Sep. 2014 Status: False
  Thank you, social media! Today I learned on Facebook that giant mutant spiders, allegedly the result of secret DNA experiments conducted in a government laboratory in rural Missouri, are now reproducing in the wild and are believed to be endangering the safety of nearby towns and cities.
  The evidence? A pair of viral images showing huge, six-legged, creepy-crawly critters scrabbling up a palm tree and threatening small animals. Never mind that palm trees don't grow in Missouri and spiders have eight legs, not six. These things are really scary!
  Text example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 12, 2014:
  RIGHT HERE IN MO !
  SPIDERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM A DNA LABORATORY LOCATED NEAR THE WOLF SANCTUARY ON ANTIRE RD !
  'Government testing on DNA has produced these spiders in a Laboratory in Missouri. Unfortunately they have been located off Lewis Rd just west of laboratory and seem to be breading in the wild much faster than when captive.'
  'Government officials are doing all they can to try to eliminate these spiders but can offer no guarantees. They could be popping up in surrounding neighborhoods west of the siting (Eureka, Pacific, Union, and St. Clair) within weeks.'
  What we have in our favor is that winter is approaching and hope to slow down the migration no further than St. Clair before the cold hits.'
  'If you see these stay indoors and call the local police. They have been informed on procedures of capture and contact of the local governing agency.'

  Highest Paid Male Actors Ever
  Analysis: Welcome to the Internet, you've been pranked! Though the photos above are authentic, they do not depict any known species of spider (as mentioned above, spiders have eight legs, not six), but rather a species of arthropod native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans known as the coconut crab or robber crab ( Birgus latro ).
  It is, in fact, the largest land-living arthropod , weighing up to 10 pounds and measuring as much as 3 feet wide from leg tip to leg tip. They climb palm trees and, as the name suggests, feed on coconuts, though adult specimens are omnivorous and also scavenge for fruit, rotting vegetation, and carrion. Coconut crabs are nocturnal animals and typically hide in burrows during daylight hours.
  Unfortunately for them, the meat of coconut crabs apparently tastes not unlike lobster and is considered a delicacy, not only by humans who live near their native habitats but by rats and wild pigs as well. They are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources as an endangered species.
  As to the origin of the photos, I was able to trace one them (of the tree-climbing specimen) to a July 2009 post by a blogger named Angelo Villagomez, who wrote that took it during a visit to Agrigan, a Pacific island just south of Guam. The image showing a pair of coconut crabs lurking in perilous proximity to a small dog has appeared previously (and accurately labeled) on Reddit.com.

"The Truth About That 'Alaskan Tree Frog' Photo","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalkingdom/ss/Alaskan-Tree-Frog.htm","Is This a Frozen 'Alaskan Tree Frog'?","2015-02-08 18:40:40","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: 2013? Status: Mislabeled (details below)
  Caption example #1:
  Alaskan tree frog. Freezes solid in winter, thaws in spring and hops off
  Caption example #2:
  This is what an Alaskan tree frog looks like. It freezes in winter, stopping its heart, then thaws in spring.
  Caption example #3:
  the Alaskan tree frog freezes and stops its heart rate completely. Thaws and comes back to life again when the conditions become favorable
  Analysis: Sorry, enthusiastic sharers, but the whimsical specimen in this photograph doesn't appear to be a real frog at all, much less a 'frozen Alaskan tree frog.' More likely, it's an iced-over ceramic garden ornament. Cute photo, to be sure, but circulating under false pretenses.
  There is, in fact, no such species as an 'Alaskan tree frog' — none that I could find in reference books on amphibians, at any rate — though it's true that scientists have identified a diminutive species named Rana sylvatica (commonly called a wood frog), that can survive Arctic temperatures for months at a time with up to two-thirds of its bodily fluids frozen solid.
  'Alaska wood frogs spend more time freezing and thawing outside than a steak does in your freezer and the frog comes back to life in the spring in better shape than the steak,' says University of Alaska Fairbanks grad student Don Larson, the lead author of a recent study on the freeze tolerance of the Alaska wood frog.
  How does the species accomplish such a feat, given that the freezing process normally damages and kills living tissues (think frostbite)?
  By overdosing on sugar, apparently. Researchers have discovered that wood frogs' bodies prepare for the coldest winter months by 'packing' their cells with glucose (blood sugar), which acts as a ' cryoprotectant ' to prevent tissues from drying out and collapsing when the water they contain turns to ice. According to Larson, wood frogs tracked in the wild proved able to endure below-zero temperatures for as many as 218 days straight with a 100 percent survival rate.
  Larson and co-author Brian Barnes believe their research may ultimately serve a more practical purpose, namely indicating ways to improve and extend the preservation of human organs for transplantation.
  Thank you, wood frog!
