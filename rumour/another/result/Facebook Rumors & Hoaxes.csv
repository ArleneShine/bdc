"Zuckerberg Gives Millions to Facebook Users?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Zuckerberg-Gives-Millions-to-Facebook-Users-Hoax.htm","2016-08-23 06:42:41","  Description: Viral Facebook post / Hoax Circulating since: Dec. 2015 Status: False
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, December 9, 2015:
  THANK YOU, MARK ZUCKERBERG, for your forward-thinking generosity! And congrats on becoming a dad! Mark Zuckerberg has announced that he is giving away $45 billion of Facebook stock. What you may not have heard is that he plans to give 10% of it away to people like YOU and ME! All you have to do is copy and paste this message into a post IMMEDIATELY. At midnight PST, Facebook will search through the day's posts and award 1000 people with $4.5 million EACH as a way of saying thank you for making Facebook such a powerful vehicle for connection and philanthropy.I hope someone I know gets a piece of the pie--let me know if you do!!!
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, December 27, 2015:
  So 4 hours from now. ..a few people are supposed to be blessed with the following gift smile emoticon Can't wait to see who the winners are tonight. Facebook Mark Zuckerberg is going to give away 4.5 million shares of his Facebook stock tonight at midnight; 10% to people like you and me! All you have to do is copy and paste this to your page and post. Facebook is doing this to show what a powerful tool of connection it is !!! Can't wait to see who wins !!! This is not a hoax!!! It's on Good Morning America!
  Analysis: While it's true that on Dec. 1, 2015 Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, will donate 99 percent of their fortune to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — a company created by them to 'advance human potential and promote equality in areas such as health, education, scientific research and energy' — it's not true that Zuckerberg has announced a plan to give away 10 percent of that amount to Facebook users who copy and paste silly viral messages.
  Think about it. If Zuckerberg had really said anything of the kind, it would have made international headlines, just like his actual announcement on Dec. 1. But it didn't.
  Ladies and gentlemen of Facebook, you've been fooled, and you should know better. This kind of hoax has been around since the dawn of the Internet.
  As a case in point, read this message, which circulated via forwarded email in 1999:
  FW: Must Read!!!! Bill Gates
  Hello everybody, My name is Bill Gates.  I have just written up an e-mail tracing program that traces everyone to whom this message is forwarded to.  I am experimenting with this and I need your help.  Forward this to everyone you know and if it reaches 1000 people everyone on the list will receive $1000 at my expense.  Enjoy.
  Your friend, Bill Gates
  The circulation of this hoax and subsequent variations of it reached such proportions that Gates himself felt compelled to issue a statement about it. 'Even more annoying than spam, in some respects, are hoaxes,' he wrote. 'I'm acutely aware of this because my name was recently attached to a hoax email message that was widely distributed.' Gates characterized the message as 'fraudulent' and 'essentially a chain letter' — and rightly so. Yet despite his personal efforts to debunk it, the hoax went right on mutating and circulate for many years to come.
  A 2013 revival of the Bill Gates giveaway hoax was passed around on Facebook in the form of a shared photo . The image showed Gates holding a handwritten sign that supposedly said, ''As some of you may know, I'm Bill Gates. If you click that share link, I will give you $5,000. I always deliver, I mean, I brought you Windows XP, right?'
  Again, that it was a prank, and not real, should have been obvious to anyone, but the photo went on to be shared by untold thousands of users and became so notorious it merited a feature on the Today Show website.
  There has evidently been some worry among social media users that the bogus Zuckerberg message may be a criminal scam of some sort. It isn't. It's simply a prank — not a particularly funny one, it's true — but that's all it is.

"5 Fridays, 5 Saturdays, 5 Sundays in a Month","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/ss/5-Fridays-5-Saturdays-5-Sundays.htm","2016-06-25 04:19:38","  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: 2011 (this version) Status: Mostly false (see below)
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, May 11, 2014:
  This is the only time you see this phenomenon in your life.
  August, 2014, will have 5 Fridays, 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. This happens only once every 823 years. The Chinese call it 'Silver Pockets full. '
  So: send this message to your friends and in four days the money will surprise you. Based on Chinese Feng Shui. Whoever does not transmit the message .... may find themselves clueless .... This is not fun at all ....
  Example #2: Email contributed by Rita B., May 12, 2011:
  THIS IS THE ONLY TIME WE WILL SEE AND LIVE THIS EVENT
  Calendar for July 2011 (United States)
  Money bags
  This year, July has 5 Fridays, 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. This happens once every 823 years. This is called money bags. So, forward this to your friends and money will arrive within 4 days. Based on Chinese Feng Shui (aka, internet bullying). The one who does not forward..... will be without money....:)
  Kinda interesting - read on!!!
  This year we're going to experience four unusual dates.
  1/1/11, 1/11/11, 11/1/11, 11/11/11 and that's not all...
  Take the last two digits of the year in which you were born - now add the age you will be this year,
  The results will be 111 for everyone in whole world.
  Analysis: It was true, as in one of the examples above, that the month of August 2014 boasted five Fridays, five Saturdays, and five Sundays, but, as I've pointed out before and since, this is not a rare phenomenon, much less one that only happens once every 823 years.
  Any 31-day month that begins on a Friday will have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays. (Or, if said 31-day month begins on a Saturday, it will have five Saturdays, five Sundays and five Mondays, and so on.)
  The last time (as of August 2014) this particular configuration occurred was in March 2013. The next occurrence (after August 2014) was in May 2015. The next occurrence of 5 Fridays, 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays in the month of August, specifically, will be in 2025. That's way less than 823 years from now.
  For future reference, there is nothing to be gained by copying and forwarding any chain letter promising vast sums of money, good luck or other nebulous rewards for simply sharing it. None of the gobbledygook in the examples above bears any real resemblance to feng shui or any other form of Chinese mysticism. Forwarding woo-woo messages doesn't confer magical powers on the sharer, no matter how many times said messages get copied and pasted and copied and pasted.
  Coincidentally, the year 2011 did feature the unique (for this century) calendar dates 1/1/11, 1/11/11, 11/1/11, and 11/11/11 — but again, there's no mystical significance in this except in the imagination of the beholder.
  And it's true that for anyone born in the last century (1900-1999), adding the two-digit year they were born (for example, '82) to the age they'll attain on their 2011 birthday (in this case, 29) will always yield the sum 111 (82 + 29 = 111). But there's nothing magical or mystical about this, either. It is always the case that when you add the year you were born to the age you turn in the current year, the sum will equal the current year: 1982 + 29 = 2011. That's simple math. When you render the birth year of someone born between 1900 and 1999 in two digits you're basically just subtracting 1900 from each side of the equation, so it becomes: 82 + 29 = 111.
  Not as remarkable as it may seem at first glance.

"It's a Scam: '16 People Dead in Roller Coaster Accident' Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/16-People-Dead-in-Roller-Coaster-Accident-Florida.htm","2014-09-12 16:04:08","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: March 2014 Status: FAKE / SCAM (see details below)
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, March 8, 2014:
  Fox Breaking News - [Shocking Video Footage] - 16 people are confirmed dead in a roller coaster accident that occurred at Universal Studios in Florida. The roller coaster appeared to have suffered a mechanical breakdown causing it to veer off the tracks in mid air plummetting all 24 passangers into the ground. Currently there are 8 listed in critical condition at an Orlando Hospital. CCTV Footage of the accident have been uploaded to the Fox News team but will be restricted to air time and will be only uploaded through the following site due to graphic content. Viewer Discretion is ADVISED. Warning the material presented in this video contains graphic content. Watch footage of the accident here: http://captin.pw/rollercoastersx115/?u4xxx
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, March 21, 2014:
  (Warning: Shocking Video) Fox News Flash : 17 passengers confirmed dead at the scene of one of the deadliest roller coaster accidents in history at Orlando, Florida Universal Studios Theme Park. The roller coaster appears to veer off the tracks mid air plummeting all 25 passengers into the pavement killing 17. There are 8 listed in critical condition at a local Orlando Hospital fighting for their life. Local law enforcement are at the scene investigating the accident. Technicians confirm that the roller coaster has malfunctioned during the ride causing it to veer off the tracks. Footage of the accident was captured through the CCTV system set up around the park and has been uploaded to the Fox News Team but will be restricted to air time due to the graphic material. As an alternative, video footage has been uploaded online and can be seen in the following link provided. Please be advised, this video contains graphic footage of the accident and is not for the faint of heart. Watch at your own risk : http://steben.pw/coasterr25/?t7
  Analysis: No such roller coaster accident occurred; no such 'shocking video footage' exists. The above post and others like it are bait for a clickjacking scam in which users who click on the links are redirected to pages outside Facebook and tricked into divulging their log-in information (email address and password), enabling scammers to hijack their accounts.
  Some versions claim 4 people died; others claim 17 people died. Some feature a doctored image purporting to be a screen shot of the video footage. The specifics vary, but the scam is always the same.
  All social media users should be wary in general of lurid come-ons purporting to link to 'shocking videos' or 'breaking news' about catastrophic events, celebrity gossip, etc. They're almost always scams. Clicking on them can put the security of your account and computer at risk.
  Here's some good basic advice from Facebook.com:
  Think before you click. Never click suspicious links, even if they come from a friend or a company you know. This includes links sent on Facebook (ex: in a chat or post) or in emails. If one of your friends clicks on spam they could accidentally send you that spam or tag you in a spammy post. You also shouldn't download things (ex: a .exe file) if you aren’t sure what they are.
  Never give out your login info (ex: email address and password). Sometimes people or pages will promise you something (ex: free poker chips) if you share your login info with them. These types of deals are carried out by cybercriminals and violate the Facebook Terms . If you're ever asked to re-enter your password on Facebook (ex: you're making changes to your account settings) check to make sure the address of the page still has facebook.com/ in the URL.

"14-Year-Old Shot or Beaten by Stepfather?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/14-Year-Old-Boy-Beaten-Half-Dead.htm","2016-03-12 18:49:55","  Description: Viral post / Facebook hoax Circulating since: November 2011 Status: False (details below)
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, Oct. 28, 2011:
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, Nov. 14, 2011:
  Analysis: The injured child in the photograph isn't named, nor is any date or location specified where the abuse supposedly took place. Indeed, the above postings contain no corroborating information whatsoever, yet we're supposed to believe Facebook has promised to donate money to defray the victim's medical costs every time the message is shared.
  Moreover, at least two different versions of the story exist. One claims the victim was 'beaten half dead' by his stepfather. The other claims he was 'shot six times.'
  What isn't wrong with this picture?
  Like previous viral messages falsely claiming that companies or charities will donate specific amounts each time someone forwards or shares the plea, this is a blatant hoax.
  Facebook has announced no such commitment. Nor would it. No reputable companies or organizations use chain letters to collect or distribute charitable funds.
  In addition to being a hoax (i.e., intentionally false information), the posts exemplify what's known as a 'like-farming' scam . Perpetrators of these scams take advantage of people's good intentions to make social media posts go viral by soliciting likes and shares.
  As to the image that appears in many of the posts purporting to show the alleged victim of parental violence, it appears to have been copied and pasted from a May 19, 2010 article in the Czech tabloid newspaper Blesk describing a criminal attack by multiple assailants on a 13-year-old boy in Teplice, Czech Republic. There is no information indicating the victim's injuries were the result of parental abuse of any kind.

"SCAM: 800-Pound (or 700-Pound) Snake Pulled Out of a Lake","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/800-Pound-Snake-Pulled-Out-of-Lake-in-Chicago.htm","2014-08-29 14:48:10","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: April 2014 Status: Scam (see details below)
  Caption example: As shared on Facebook, Aug. 29, 2014:
  [SHOCKING VIDEO] 700 pound Snake pulled out of Lake in North Carolina? Giant 700 pound snake caught in lake in Proctor, North Carolina. The giant man eating python was measured at 98 feet long.
  Caption example: As shared on Facebook, April 28, 2014:
  800 Pound Snake Pulled out of Lake in Chicago Illinois Click to WATCH the News !
  Analysis: This is a clickjacking scam . The touted video doesn't exist, or is fake. No 800-pound (or 700-pound) snake was found in any lake near Chicago, Illinois (or Proctor, North Carolina). Given that the largest known species of snake tops out at around 550 pounds max, it's safe to say no 800-pound snake has ever been found anywhere.
  The scam postings were created using an actual photo taken in Indonesia in 2012. The specimen in the image is probably a reticulated python whose size is greatly enhanced by camera perspective. The same photo was used previously in an online hoax claiming that it documents the capture of a 24-foot-long, 700-pound rattlesnake in North Carolina.
  Scams like this spread by tempting users into trying to access videos they're required to share before viewing, which causes the blurbs to be republished on their own timelines and friends' news feeds, where more users are exposed to them, and so on ad infinitum. Users who comply are then redirected to pages where they're invited to take surveys, accept promotional offers, and/or download software -- in this case, a 'special media player codec' -- which is inadvisable, to put it mildly, given that there's no way to know where the software is coming from or what it really does.
  At no point does anyone ever actually get to view the video, because, again, the video doesn't exist.
  It's not worth risking the security of your social media account, computer, or network by clicking on links in fly-by-night posts like these. When 'shocking' or 'breaking news' video blurbs turn up in your news feed for no apparent reason, play it safe and just delete them. Advise your friends to do the same.

  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, Aug. 9, 2011:
  Analysis: As often happens, a viral message which once upon a time had some truth to it continues to be posted, reposted, and re-reposted even though it has outlived its purpose -- to the point where now, three years down the road, it's simply false, irrelevant, and annoying.
  In January 2011 there were indeed 52 thoroughbred horses left homeless by a deceased owner in northeastern Ohio (though whether or not they were actually in danger of being 'slaughtered' remains a matter of debate), but thanks in part to a timely plea by race horse enthusiast and Facebook member Lynn Boggs, all of those horses were successfully relocated within days.
  So her original posting was already out of date by the beginning of February, yet as of August 10, 2011, new and old versions of it were still replicating at the rate of several hundred repostings a day.
  Moral of the story: Good news doesn't travel as fast as bad news, or linger as long. Always check the facts before sharing!

  08/04/11 Update: The '72B 381' Amber Alert hoax is making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter again. It's still false (see history below). As of the past few months, the viral text now claims the alleged abduction took place in Edmonton, Kentucky, and that the perpetrator's car has a Quebec license plate:
  AMBER ALERT!!! Edmonton, Kentucky USA little girl, 3 yrs old picked up by man driving grey car, license plate: Quebec 72B 381. Canada. Put this as your status. It could save her.

  04/19/10 Update: After a weekend lull, the '72B381' Amber Alert hoax is going strong again on Facebook. New variant claims it's a Washington state license plate:

  Examples:

  07/13/09 Update: The same fake Amber Alert that fooled tens of thousands of people last February is making the Twitter rounds again, with a vengeance. The only essential change is that the text now claims the abducted child is three years old, not seven. The locale is currently specified as Idaho Falls, Idaho.
  If you receive this message or any variant thereof, please inform all senders it's a hoax:
  RT **AMBER ALERT** 3 YR OLD GIRL WAS TAKEN BY A MAN DRIVING A NEWER SILVER TRUCK IN IDAHO FALLS,ID LIC. PLATE #72B381. KEEP it goin
  Originally Posted 02/10/09: It's a veritable case study in how fast and how far hoaxes can mutate and spread via social media.
  An unofficial Amber Alert that apparently originated in Salt Lake City last Sunday night crisscrossed the country over the following two days, convincing well-meaning text messagers and Twitter users from Maryland to California that a 7-year-old girl in their state had been abducted by a man driving a 'newer silver truck' with the license plate number 72B381.
  The message is false. Police say there are no real missing-person cases fitting that description.
  A very early version of the alert read as follows:
  FWD: FWD: FW: AMBER ALERT A 7 yr old girl was taken by a man driving a newer silver truck. The license plate reads 72b381 please please pass on.
  By the time Utah authorities disavowed the bogus message on Monday, it had already spread to Wisconsin...
  Retweet: AMBER ALERT. A seven year old girl was taken by a man driving a newer silver truck. license plate # 72B381 Menomonie area FWD PLZ
  ...not to mention Woodward, Oklahoma...
  AMBER ALERT!! A 7yr old girl was taken from Woodward by a man driving a newer silver truck plate # 72B381, please forward!
  ...and on to Tulsa...
  TULSA AMBER ALERT - 7 year old girl taken from woodward park by man in newer silver truck with plate number 72B381
  From there, the Amber Alert hoax migrated to Fresno, California; Yuma, Arizona; Mahnomen, Minnesota; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Albany, Oregon; and many points in between. As of this writing, the bogus message is still circulating at a rapid clip in parts of Ohio and spreading into Iowa.
  The geographical progression of the hoax can be roughly tracked by examining the Twitter search results for messages (several hundred of them so far, and counting) containing the bogus license plate number, '72B381.'
  FYI, Amber Alerts can (and clearly should) be authenticated by checking the Active Amber Alerts page on the website of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

"A Little Girl Called Clarissa","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/ghoststories/a/Clarissa-Chain-Letter.htm","2015-04-27 23:23:14","  By David Emery
  Online chain letter tells the story of Clarissa, a little girl who was committed to a mental hospital after killing her pwn parents. She died there. If you don't share this story, the chain letter says, Clarissa's hateful ghost will kill you, too.
  Description: Chain letter / Ghost story Circulating since: 2008 Status: False (see details below)
  Example #1: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 13, 2013:
  WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!
  Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More-government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died.
  Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.
  Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or im sorry

  ADVERTENCIA! Continúe leyendo! O usted va a morir, incluso si sólo miró a la advertencia de palabra!
  Había una vez una niña llamada Clarissa, que era de diez años de edad y vivía en un hospital psiquiátrico, porque ella mató a su mamá y su papá. Ella tiene mal que se fue a matar a todo el personal en el hospital por lo que el gobierno más decidido que mejor idea era conseguir librarse de ella por lo que creó una sala especial para matarla, como humano posible pero salió mal la máquina que estaban usando que salió mal. Y ella se sentó en agonía durante horas hasta que murió.
  Now every semana en el día de su muerte regresa a la persona que lee esta carta, en una noche de lunes a las 12:00 am Ella se arrastra a tu habitación y te mata lentamente, mediante la reducción de ti y verte sangrar hasta la muerte. Ahora envía esto a diez otras fotos en este sitio, y se perseguirá a alguien que no lo hace.

U o bien vayan a besar o invitado a salir, si u romper esta cadena u se ve una niña muerta en su habitación esta noche. En 53 minutos alguien va a decir te quiero o lo siento
  Example #4: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 10, 2012:
  Analysis: As ghost stories go, this one is slight and more preposterous than most, but that hasn't dampened its success as an Internet chain letter . As of this writing, a Google search yields 60,000-plus postings of the text since 2008, most of them attributable, it appears, to gullible adolescents.
  'Clarissa' shares the same basic aim of all chain letters, namely self-reproduction. These copy-and-share texts promise everything from good luck, free money, or philanthropic beneficence on the positive side, to threats of misfortune, calamity, and even painful death on the negative, all in the cause of manipulating recipients into sharing them as quickly and as widely as possible.
  In common with others of its ilk, the 'Clarissa' chain letter is especially insidious in that it targets young social media users and encourages them to repost the text randomly and repeatedly in comment threads on sites like Facebook and Google Plus, interrupting conversations and rankling other users. I hate to scold, but this is just bad manners.
  Chain letters don't have magical powers. Ten-year-old 'Clarissa' never existed. It goes without saying that her ghost isn't going around killing people who fail to share this stupider-than-most chain letter. Think before you share!

  Description: Viral image Circulating since: Nov. 2012 Status: False
  Text example #1: As shared on Facebook, Dec. 22, 2012:
  Text example #2: As shared on Facebook, Dec. 13, 2013:
  Analysis: Has the so-called 'War on Christmas' been extended to social media? Is it true that Facebook doesn't want people sharing nativity images because it might 'offend' someone who isn't a Christian?
  Absolutely not.
  The best disproof of this fabricated controversy is the fact that three years after the above image was first shared on Facebook by someone claiming it was being banned, it's still being shared today. Three-year-old posts containing the image still exist on Facebook, untouched. I've found no instances in which the image had been removed, or in which any individual members stated that they had actually been asked by Facebook to remove it.
  Facebook's terms of service forbid posting nudity, pornography, hate speech, threats, incitements to violence, and graphic or gratuitous violence. It also forbids bullying, intimidating or harassing any user.
  But there's nothing in the terms of service forbidding the posting of religious images. Indeed, one can find religious-themed images — Christian and otherwise — everywhere on Facebook.

  Synopsis: The newest version of an old, viral Facebook hoax claims the company will begin charging an 'entry price' of €5.99 (or $5.99) unless users copy and paste the alert to their own pages. As before, the message is completely false.
  Description: Hoax Circulating since: Sept. 2015 Status: False
  Example:
  Now it's official! It is published in the media. Facebook has just released his entry price: € 5,99 to keep the subscription gold of your status of life 'private'. If you paste this message on your page, it will be offered free (I said paste not share) if not tomorrow, all your posts can become public. Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste.
  As shared on Facebook, Sept. 27, 2015
  Analysis: False. No such announcement was made by Facebook or published in the media. This is a boldfaced hoax.
  As Facebook has stated more than once: 'We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.' In answer to a direct question from the press on that subject in 2009, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said, again, 'The answer is no, we are not planning on charging a basic fee for our basic services.' To date, the company has shown no signs of reneging on that promise.
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  There's no reason why it should
  Nevertheless, similar copy-and-paste rumors have circulated on and off since 2009, when the first of many such chain letters first appeared protesting a nonexistent plan to charge Facebook users $4.99 per month for membership.
  Rumors and hoaxes like these exist for the same reason that Facebook takes pains to deny them — because, second only (perhaps) to privacy, free membership is of the utmost concern to rank and file Facebook users. Before Facebook, similar rumors circulated about other free online services such as Hotmail.
  Rumors typically cluster around the things that are most important to us; that's how folklore works. Hoaxes do too, except that, in contrast to rumors, they're intentionally created to deceive people. Where there is fear — the fear, for example, that we may be forced to start paying for something that has always been free and that we've come to firmly believe ought to be free — there will always be people willing to exploit that fear, whether to get attention ('likes' and 'shares'), to give themselves the illusion of having power over others, or just for kicks.
  I'm often asked how this sort of hoaxing and rumor-mongering can be stopped, and my answer is always the same: it can't be stopped, because it's human nature. We could at least make a dent in it if we would all take responsibility for what we copy and paste and share with online friends, however. It's not hard to do a little fact-checking in this day and age.
  More to the point, even if you're not a good fact-checker, all that's really required of anyone is that if you don't really know if something is true, don't share it.

  Example #1: As posted on Facebook, Sep. 5, 2013:
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, March 9, 2013:
  Analysis: This is an old viral alert updated with references to Facebook's new Graph Search feature (mislabeled 'Graph App' or 'Graphic App' in the rumor texts above).
  These messages are largely inaccurate and give incorrect advice on adjusting privacy settings.
  Contrary to what's claimed, Graph Search won't make any of your Facebook content or activities visible to strangers unless they're already 'public' per your own privacy settings. Graph Search simply gives other members another way to find your stuff.
  For example, if your current privacy settings only allow friends to view photos and status updates, Graph Search won't change that — only friends will be able to see your content, including in search results. However, if your current settings allow your content to be viewed by everyone, then everyone, friends and non-friends alike, will be able to see it in Graph Search results. That's pretty straightforward.
  Tagging complicates matters somewhat. If someone tags you in a photo, comment, or status update, the visibility of the tagged material is governed by the privacy settings of the person who posted it. In those cases you have the option of 1) deleting the tag yourself, or 2) asking the member who tagged you to adjust their overall settings to make their posts more private.
  Whatever you do, don't rely on the instructions given in the viral alert, which are laughably wrong and misleading. All you'll accomplish is blocking some of your friends' updates from appearing on your timeline (or yours on theirs). It will not prevent your (or their) content from appearing in Graph Search or being otherwise visible to the public at large.
  If you do want to change your privacy settings (or are unsure what your current settings are) follow these instructions from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

  Bonjour à tous ceux qui sont dans ma liste de contacts de Facebook. J'ai un service à vous demander... Facebook a changé sa configuration de privacité, encore une fois! Grâce à la nouvelle 'graphic app' n'importe qui dans FB (même quelqu'un dans un pays étranger), peut voir vos photos, connaitre vos goûts et lire vos commentaires. Ce message sera affiché pendant les 2 prochaines semaines et, s'il vous plait, une fois que vous ferez ce que je vous demande, répondez avec la mention 'Fait!' Quand vos amis font click sur 'J'aime' ou 'Commentaire', automatiquement leurs amis peuvent, eux aussi, voir nos messages. Malheureusement, on ne peut pas changer cette configuration nous mêmes. Donc, svp , mettez la souris sur mon nom (sans cliquer), une fenêtre va apparaître. Faites glisser alors la souris sur 'Amis' (toujours sans cliquer) et après sur 'Paramètres'. Cliquez sur 'Paramètres'. Une liste apparaît. Enlèvez de cette liste 'événements marquants' et 'commentaires et mentions j'aime'. De cette façon, mon activité entre mes amis et ma famille n'est plus publique. Maintenant, copiez et collez ceci dans votre mur (J'ai bien dit : COPIER ET COLLER, et non 'partager'). Une fois que je le verrai publié, je ferai de même. Merci...

  Analysis: Beware of 'helpful' shared messages purporting to explain how you can protect your privacy, avoid scams, hackers, or viruses, or otherwise enhance your Facebook security. All too often the recommendations contained therein are flat-out wrong and the opposite of helpful.
  Consider, for example, the instructions below, which will supposedly cause all your comments and likes to be hidden from public view:
  I tried this. All it did was remove my friend's comments and likes from my timeline — which isn't the same as making them private.
  The reality is that if you want to stop your comments and likes from being seen by the general public, you have to ask your friends to change their privacy settings, not simply hide your posts from their timeline. See Sophos.com for detailed instructions.
  Update: Facebook 'Graph App' Privacy Alert - A new version of this message claims Facebook users' privacy will be compromised by the new Graph Search feature and gives the same bad advice for fixing it.

  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 2, 2014:
  Due to the fact that Facebook has chosen to involve software that will allow the theft of my personal information, I do declare the following: on this day, September 2 nd 2014, in response to the new Facebook guidelines and under articles L.111, 112 and 113 of the code of intellectual property, I declare that my rights are attached to all my personal data, drawings, paintings, photos, texts etc. published on my profile. For commercial use of the foregoing my written consent is required at all times.
  Those reading this text can copy it and paste it on their Facebook wall. This will allow them to place themselves under the protection of copyright. By this release, I tell Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, broadcast, or to take any other action against me on the basis of this profile and/or its contents. The actions mentioned above apply equally to employees, students, agents and/or other staff under the direction of Facebook.
  The contents of my profile include private information. The violation of my privacy is punished by the law (UCC 1 1-308 - 308 1 -103 and the Rome Statute). Facebook is now an open capital entity. All members are invited to post a notice of this kind, or if you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you have not published this statement at least once, you will tacitly allow the use of elements such as your photos as well as the information contained in your profile update.
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, June 11, 2013:
  Warning!!! - Any person and/or institution and/or Agent and/or Agency of any governmental structure including but not limited to the United States Federal Government also using or monitoring/using this website or any of its associated websites, you DO NOT have my permission to utilize any of my profile information nor any of the content contained herein including, but not limited to my photos, and.../or the comments made about my photos or any other 'picture' art posted on my profile. You are hereby notified that you are strictly prohibited from disclosing, copying, distributing, disseminating, or taking any other action against me with regard to this profile and the contents herein. The foregoing prohibitions also apply to your employee, agent, student or any personnel under your direction or control the contents of this profile are private and legally privileged and confidential information, and the violation of my personal privacy is punishable by law. UCC 1-103 1-308 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED WITHOUT PREJUDICE
  For those of you who do not understand the reasoning behind this posting, Facebook is now a publicly traded entity. Unless you state otherwise, anyone can infringe on your right to privacy once you post to this site. It is recommended that you and other members post a similar notice as this, or you may copy and paste this version. If you do not post such a statement once, then you are indirectly allowing public use of items such as your photos and the information contained in your status. YOU HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE.
  Analysis: Variants of these texts have been circulating on Facebook since May 2012. There was a fresh wave of postings in June 2013 after news reports revealed the extent of the federal government's electronic snooping under the NSA's 'PRISM' program, and another following the October 2013 announcement of an update of Facebook's own privacy policy .
  The premise, apparently, is that simply copying and pasting a statement to the effect that one's profile and posted materials are 'private and legally privileged' is sufficient to protect them from monitoring, infringement, and/or unauthorized use by Facebook or anyone else. But that's not the case. The posts have no legal standing.
  Your contract with Facebook
  The privacy and conditions of use of the information you share on and/or with Facebook are governed by the Terms of Service and Data Use Policy you automatically agree to by using Facebook, as well as by the Privacy Settings you choose when configuring your account. No amount of legalese added to your wall supersedes those terms and settings.
  For example, the Terms of Service state that you, as a Facebook member, 'own all of the content and information you post on Facebook,' but also that you 'specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).' Also, 'When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).'
  Therefore, if you've published content on Facebook using the Public setting it does you no good at all to post a notice saying 'you DO NOT have my permission to utilize any of my profile information nor any of the content contained herein,' etc., because you've already tacitly granted that permission to any and all who might view it.

  Online postings circulating in various forms and languages since 2009 claim Facebook has established a new membership price grid and will begin charging users a monthly fee for basic services. It wasn't true and is unlikely to change. These postings often include links to external websites with malware.

  Information Category: Business - Public Relations Description: WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR FACEBOOK Privacy Type: Open: All content is public.
  WE'RE AGAINST THE 4.99 A MONTH CHARGE FOR FACEBOOK FROM JUNE 30TH 2010
  A version of this text first appeared in 2009 on a bogus Facebook page inciting users to protest an alleged plan by the company to charge a $4.99 monthly fee. Similar false claims have circulated before and since. In this particular case, members were directed to an external website that delivered malicious software to unsuspecting visitors. Facebook has since deleted the group.
  While Facebook executives have never explicitly ruled out instituting fees for specific features on the site, they have repeatedly denied having plans to impose a blanket charge on all users. The question was put to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in an April 2009 interview with Business Week editor Stephen J. Adler.
  'The answer is no, we are not planning on charging a basic fee for our basic services,' Sandberg said. 'Once again, that question stems from people thinking we're growing so quickly, we're running out of money. We're growing really quickly, but we can finance that growth. We're not going to charge for our basic services.'
  In 2012, there was a resurgence of this rumor apparently prompted by news that a new tool is being tested in New Zealand that would enable Facebook users to pay a fee to make posts more visible to friends. This was a test and far different from charging all users a general membership fee.

""Giant Python Caught in the Red Sea" Video Is a Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Giant-Python-Caught-in-the-Red-Sea.htm","2014-11-20 13:57:07","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: Sep. 2014 Status: Scam (see details below)
  Example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 17, 2014:
  [True Video] - Giant python caught in the Red Sea!
  The world biggest Snake has been found in SAAD - Karaj (Iran) it has 43m height and 6m Length and 103 yrs old, The sources gave him temporary oxygen for while until get cure and they called him (MAGA MAAR MALAD) Snake......
  Analysis: We've seen these images before. Staged using toy soldiers and an ordinary dead snake, they were created for display on a message board frequented by Vietnamese college students and gaming enthusiasts. In 2010 the images began making the social media rounds with various false stories attached, e.g., ' Amazing Giant Snake Found in the Red Sea .'
  This latest incarnation is a bait-and-switch tease for a clickjacking scam . Users who attempt to view the video are redirected to a bogus Facebook page where they're told it's 'mandatory' to share the video before they can see it. Once they've shared it -- spamming the scam to everyone on their friends list -- they're prompted to download special 'VideoPerformer' software which, if consented to, likely results in the installation of adware or malware on their computers.
  It pays to be careful when you're confronted with posts inviting you to view lurid videos or 'shocking news' updates. It's all too easy to compromise the security of your social media accounts, computer, and network to phishing and malware attacks.

  Analysis: Like so many other social media posts touting a 'SHOCKING VIDEO' of this or that, this one promising a 'ghost caught on tape' is a clickjacking scam. Users who follow links in these posts are redirected to a phony Facebook page, where they're then asked to share the video before viewing it. The joke is on them, because there is no video.
  What happens after you click the Share button is that you're asked to fill out a survey form, generating some nice revenue for the scammers, and, worst case scenario, exposed to a malware attack. Don't get suckered by these scams.

"SCAM: "Giant Anaconda Swallows Up a Zookeeper" Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/SCAM-Giant-Anaconda-Swallows-Up-Zookeeper-Video.htm","2015-02-08 19:47:54","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: March 2014 Status: Scam (see details below)
  Caption example: As shared on Facebook, April 4, 2014:
  [Shocking VIDEO] A giant Anaconda swallows Up a Nigga Zookeeper in South Africa Scared! World's largest Anaconda
  Analysis: Here we have yet another example of a viral Facebook scam touting a so-called 'shocking video' as a means of exploiting user clicks to rack up page views and/or money.
  An almost identical scam titled ' Giant Snake Swallows Up a Zookeeper ' circulated just a few months before this one appeared.
  This particular version is configured such that users who try to view the video are redirected to a phony Facebook page where they're first asked to share, then to like the video before they can see it. Sharing it causes a blurb similar to the one above to appear on the user's timeline. Liking it causes the user's news feed to be inundated by spam posts.
  Unlike many instances in which the advertised video doesn't really exist, this time there is actually a video to view once you've jumped through the scammers' hoops. It last about 30 seconds and shows a snake eating a crocodile, not a zookeeper. Worth the trouble? No. Worth the risk? Definitely not.
  Don't endanger the security of your Facebook account, your computer, or your network by clicking on links in bogus posts promoting 'shocking videos' or 'breaking news.' If such blurbs show up in your news feed, delete them.
  Advise friends to do the same.
  Here's some good basic advice all users should follow, direct from Facebook:
  Think before you click. Never click suspicious links, even if they come from a friend or a company you know. This includes links sent on Facebook (ex: in a chat or post) or in emails. If one of your friends clicks on spam they could accidentally send you that spam or tag you in a spammy post. You also shouldn't download things (ex: a .exe file) if you aren’t sure what they are.

"FACEBOOK SCAM: 'Girl Killed Herself Live on Cam' Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Girl-Killed-Herself-on-Cam-Video.htm","2014-07-19 21:22:49","  Description: Viral wall postings Circulating since: Feb. 2014 Status: SCAM (see details below)
  Text example: As shared on Facebook, Feb. 17, 2014:
  Girl Killed Herself Live on Cam Just After Dad Seen Her While Doing This on Cam She was feeling so much shame and could not see in her dad eyes
  Text example: As shared on Facebook, Feb. 19, 2014:
  Girl Killed Herself Live on cam just after mom seen Her While Doing This on Cam She was feeling so much shame and could not see in her mom eyes
  Analysis: Let's face it, it's 2014 and by this time Facebook users ought to know better than to click on lurid posts touting videos of half-naked girls killing themselves on-camera. Seriously.
  It's a prime example of what's called a clickjacking scam (aka survey scam). People who take the bait and click on links in these posts are typically redirected to a phony Facebook page where they are asked to share the video before viewing it. Why? So the post will be replicated on that user's page, exposing everyone who sees it to the scam as well.
  Users who've clicked through this far expecting to see an actual video shouldn't hold their breath. They will now be asked to take an online survey (by which means the scammers make their money). They may also be offered the opportunity to download free 'security' software (which they should not do under any circumstances, because it's almost certainly some sort of Trojan horse virus or other malware).
  When, after all that trouble, do you actually get to see the video?
  Never. The video doesn't exist. You have been successfully scammed.

  Previous versions include:
  • 'A Virtual Card for You' Virus Warning • 'Invitation' Virus Warning • 'Merry Christmas' Virus Warning • 'Hallmark Postcard' Virus Warning
  These are all hoaxes — or, to be more precise, they're all versions of the same hoax.

","Facebook Rumors & Hoaxes"
"","https://www.lifewire.com/truth-about-facebook-chain-status-updates-2487399","","  Everyone and their grandmother has been posting legalese-laden copyright notices in their status updates over the past couple of days because of a Facebook chain status post hoax that went viral.
  What are Facebook Chain Status Updates?
  Remember chain letters and chain e-mails? A few years back you couldn't open your inbox without seeing an email claiming that Bill Gates was giving away money and he wants you to send the email to all your friends so they can get some free money too.
  Some chain letters were said to bring you luck if you forwarded a copy to several people. Other chain emails preyed on fear or superstition, claiming that something bad would happen to you if you broke the chain. Some malicious chain emails carried Trojan horse malware as attachments, resulting in rapid widespread infections, due to the viral nature of chain emails.
  Chain status updates are the next logical evolution of the traditional chain letter. The messages are the same, but now, social media is the new medium.
  A chain status update is any status update that has a statement in it that asks you to repost it as your status, or asks that you post it to the wall of several friends. We've all seen them. Some are well meaning inspirational quotes, some tug at your heartstrings, but they all have the line in them that says 'please copy and paste this as your status for the next 3 hours' or something to that effect.
  Why do People Create Chain Status Updates?
  The reasons people post chain status updates are many. Sometimes they just really like what the originator had to say or maybe they just want to see how far it will spread. The chain post may be part of a Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) scheme, or it could be an attempt to try and spread malware or phishing links.
  Whatever the reason, chain status updates are here and are likely here to stay?
  How Can You Spot a Harmful Chain Status Update?
  If the chain status update asks you to click on something, visit a link, or provide personal information of some kind then the chain status update may be a malicious one. Don't visit the site advertised in the chain status update and don't repost it to your status or anyone's wall. Alert the friend who posted it that they may be unwittingly spreading a malicious chain status update and advise them to remove it.
  If you think your friend's Facebook account has been hacked and that someone is posting a malicious post from their account, alert them by phone or some other means other than Facebook messaging.
  How Can you Stop the Spread of Chain Status Updates?
  Recognizing chain posts for what they are is key to preventing their spread. The key part of the post is that little part at the end that says 'copy and paste this' or 'place this in your status'. If it asks you to post it then it is a chain. It's that simple.
  Unless it's a harmless inspirational-type of chain status update that you find amusing and there is something in you that just can't resist reposting it, don't repost anything that asks you to repost.
  The one exception to this rule is links to funny cat pictures or cat-related memes. I can't get enough of these and I think everyone on the Internet will agree with me on this one.
  Most chain status updates are harmless other than wasting time and bandwidth.
  The recent Facebook copyright hoax is a good example of a time wasting hoax in the form of a chain status update. We may never know the goals of the people who post these hoaxes, but we do know that, as Smokey the Bear says, 'Only you can prevent forest fires', the same goes for chain status posts.

"Facebook Hoax Claims 'Giraffe Challenge' Created by Hackers","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Facebook-Hoax-Claims-Giraffe-Challenge-Created-by-Hackers.htm","2013-11-11 02:48:28","  Description: Viral message / Hacker warning Circulating since: Oct. 2013 Status: False (see details below)
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, Oct. 28, 2013:
  **URGENT** GIRAFFE GAME NOTICE **URGENT** Just found out that the Giraffe challenge was set up by the hacking group 'Anonymous'. Apparently they're going to embark on a random 'cleansing' program which will wipe out the bank accounts and hard drives of those people who have giraffe profile pics...A few of my FB friends have already had it happen, so change your pics back & Delete the game!!!
  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, Oct. 28, 2013:
  HEY!!!! GIRAFFE PEOPLE!! Change your pics back to normal, apparently it's a hoax for someone to hack you! Just passing it on from something I've read!
  Example #3: As shared on Facebook, Oct. 28, 2013:
  Just read that the giraffe game was set up by the group anonymous to hack bank accounts and hard drives of those who changed their profile pictures to a giraffe
  Analysis: There's no truth to these spurious warnings, which apparently originated as a prank meant to spoil the fun of users participating in the 'Giraffe Challenge' game that took Facebook by storm in late October 2013.
  The game consisted of a riddle participants were asked to solve, on pain of having to find and upload a photo of a giraffe in place of their profile pic if they failed to solve it correctly.
  Example of the 'Giraffe Challenge' post :
  CHALLENGE: READ THE RULES WELL! If you get the answer right, you get to keep your profile picture. If you get the answer wrong, you have to change your profile picture into a giraffe. (and keep it for at least 3 days.) DO NOT POST YOUR ANSWER HERE! You have to message me so you don’t give away the right answer (if you guess it!). If you post an answer on this thread (right or wrong) you HAVE to change your picture. RIDDLE: It’s 3AM and your doorbell rings!!!! UNEXPECTED VISITORS! They are your parents and they are hungry for breakfast. You have strawberry jam, honey, wine, bread and cheese. What is the first thing you open???? Remember the rules, PM me your answer. If you get it right I will post it on this thread. Get it wrong and you have to go look for a giraffe picture!
  It's a trick question, of course. Most participants were bound to fail to give the 'correct' answer (scroll down past 'Spoiler Alert' below to see what it was) and wound up changing their profile pics, if only temporarily. It was all in innocent fun.
  Social media sites are rife with faddish games and puzzles like this, to the unending annoyance of a subset of users who apparently get their jollies by spoiling everyone else's fun. We watched this happen in November 2010, for example, when the fad of the moment was replacing one's profile photo with a drawing of a cartoon character. What began as a pointless bit of fun quickly morphed into an impromptu crusade against child abuse, which was met with unsettling rumors to the effect that the crusade had been started by pedophiles as a means of identifying and targeting underage users. As in the present case, the rumors proved to be unfounded and almost certainly originated as a prank.
  Does 'Anonymous' want to hack your personal Facebook page? No.
  As for Anonymous , the loose-knit 'hacktivist' group said to be behind this latest plot to attack Facebook users, it would be completely out of character for them to do so. Anonymous is known for attacking high-profile targets like government and corporate websites, not ordinary folks like you or me. Among other reasons, it wouldn't be worth their trouble.
  You may upload your giraffe pics without fear.
  Spoiler Alert!
  Here are the two answers to the riddle most often accepted as 'correct':
  1. The first thing you open is the door. 2. The first thing you open is your eyes.

Their task would be made easier if there actually were a video showing what happened in the cockpit before the plane disappeared, but there's no reason to believe one exists.
  Social media blurbs promoting a so-called 'Hijacker Video of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370' are a cynical scam exploiting public interest in the fate of the missing Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew members aboard.
  Users who click on links in hopes of viewing the video are redirected to a page where they're asked to share it before viewing it. They're then redirected to one of several other websites where they're invited to click buttons to test the speed of their PC or download special software -- neither of which is advisable, needless to say.

  Analysis: These blurbs are examples of a clickjacking scam using bait-and-switch tactics to lure users to deceptive websites where they're required to complete marketing surveys and/or download potentially dangerous software in order to view a promoted video which, in most cases, does not exist.
  Users who click through are also required to share the video before viewing it, which is how the blurbs 'go viral.' It's always a bad idea to comply with such a requirement. Not only do you spam your own friends and expose them to a scam, you also, in effect, grant scammers access to your Facebook (or other social media) account. Think before you click!
  The creepy-looking image used in the blurb above, supposedly depicting some sort of horrendous skin condition somebody got from using a name-brand shampoo, is a familiar bit of fakery created by combining a photo of human skin with a photo of a lotus seed pod . The medical condition is not real.

  Analysis: This is a clickjacking scam (aka survey scam). As in previous examples (see below), users who click the link to view the advertised video are redirected to a fake Facebook page and asked to share the video before viewing it. After spamming their friends, users are then instructed to fill out a survey form (which is how the scammers make their money).
  In some cases, malicious software may be downloaded to the user's computer. At no point will the user actually get to see the advertised video, which in fact does not exist.

  Subject: FW: URGENT!
  PLEASE CIRCULATE to your friends, family and contacts.
  In the coming days, Do not open any message with an attachment called: Black in the White House,
  Regardless of who sent you ... It is a virus that opens an Olympic torch that burns the whole hard disk C of your computer. This virus comes from a known person who you had in your list Directions. . That's why you should send this message to all your contacts.

And there is no repair yet for this kind of virus. This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the hard disk, where information vital function is stored.
  Analysis: No such computer virus exists. These fake warnings are variants of a virus hoax that has circulated in many forms over the past two decades.
  Previous versions include:
  • 'A Virtual Card for You' Virus Warning • 'Invitation' Virus Warning • 'Merry Christmas' Virus Warning • 'Hallmark Postcard' Virus Warning
  These are all hoaxes — or, to be more precise, they're all versions of the same hoax. Following the advice of unsourced viral alerts like these is an ineffective, if not outright counter-productive, way of maintaining computer or network security. Protecting oneself from real virus and Trojan threats requires a few simple though critically important measures.
  Follow these religiously:

"SCAM: "Giant Anaconda Swallows Up a Zookeeper" Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Malaysian-Airlines-Finally-Found-Video-Scam.htm","2015-02-08 19:47:54","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: March 2014 Status: Scam (see details below)
  Caption example: As shared on Facebook, April 4, 2014:
  [Shocking VIDEO] A giant Anaconda swallows Up a Nigga Zookeeper in South Africa Scared! World's largest Anaconda
  Analysis: Here we have yet another example of a viral Facebook scam touting a so-called 'shocking video' as a means of exploiting user clicks to rack up page views and/or money.
  An almost identical scam titled ' Giant Snake Swallows Up a Zookeeper ' circulated just a few months before this one appeared.
  This particular version is configured such that users who try to view the video are redirected to a phony Facebook page where they're first asked to share, then to like the video before they can see it. Sharing it causes a blurb similar to the one above to appear on the user's timeline. Liking it causes the user's news feed to be inundated by spam posts.
  Unlike many instances in which the advertised video doesn't really exist, this time there is actually a video to view once you've jumped through the scammers' hoops. It last about 30 seconds and shows a snake eating a crocodile, not a zookeeper. Worth the trouble? No. Worth the risk? Definitely not.
  Don't endanger the security of your Facebook account, your computer, or your network by clicking on links in bogus posts promoting 'shocking videos' or 'breaking news.' If such blurbs show up in your news feed, delete them.
  Advise friends to do the same.
  Here's some good basic advice all users should follow, direct from Facebook:
  Think before you click. Never click suspicious links, even if they come from a friend or a company you know. This includes links sent on Facebook (ex: in a chat or post) or in emails. If one of your friends clicks on spam they could accidentally send you that spam or tag you in a spammy post. You also shouldn't download things (ex: a .exe file) if you aren’t sure what they are.

Like so many warnings replicated across Facebook by earnest users, this is a hoax.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: This is a hoax, circulating since May 2006. Neither the Philadelphia Police Department nor the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children lists (or has ever listed) a missing child by the name of Ashley Flores. No Amber Alert has ever been issued in her name.
  Moreover, the viral message contains none of the critical details one would expect to find in a real alert -- for example, a physical description of the missing person, the time and place of disappearance and contact information. Another giveaway is the presence in the body of the message of several sentences copied word-for-word from previous 'missing child' hoaxes (see Penny Brown and C.J. Mineo ).
  Though she never really went missing, it appears that Ashley Flores does exist and lived in Philadelphia when these alerts first started going around. By following hyperlinks embedded in a version posted on MySpace.com, I found an exact match (long since deleted) for the image above in a photo gallery on Photobucket.com, along with several others (long since deleted) that were uploaded by the same user and featured a young woman named Ashley who bore more than a passing resemblance to the girl pictured above.
  The images were posted by someone using the screen name 'Vixter609,' whom I found blogging under the same alias on MySpace.com with her given name listed as 'Vicki,' her age as 17 and her city of residence as Philadelphia.
  When I contacted Vicki to ask what, if anything, she knew about Ashley Flores and her status as a 'missing person,' I received the following reply (reproduced verbatim):
  Subsequent inquiries went unanswered. That this little joke caused 'confusion' is putting it mildly.
  After a version of the Ashley Flores email containing the contact info of the Rolla, Missouri police department circulated in 2009, said police department was forced to change its telephone number because it was receiving up to 75 calls per day on the matter. The city's online FAQ page still contains a reference to the hoax.
  The Flores alert is listed on the U.S. Department of Justice Amber Alert website as a known hoax.

  Social media postings claiming that the plane has been found and that there might be survivors are cynical scams attempting to exploit public interest in the fate of the lost airliner, which vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.
  The blurbs are propagated by unwary users who attempt to view a nonexistent 'BBC News video' supposedly showing the discovery of the aircraft. After complying with instructions to like and share the video, which causes the blurbs to appear on their own timelines and the news feeds of their friends, users are then prompted to download unnecessary and possibly malicious software to their computers. Needless to say, this is inadvisable.

  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, Nov. 29, 2011:
  Example #3: As shared on Facebook, Nov. 29, 2011:
  Example #4: As shared on Facebook, July 23, 2011:
  Analysis: Did a Pepsi-Cola worker put HIV-contaminated blood in bottles containing Pepsi products?
  No.
  Does the question sound familiar? It should.
  Versions of the same rumor have made the rounds previously, in 2004 , and again in 2007-2008 . In those previous instances the food products allegedly contaminated with HIV-positive blood were ketchup and tomato sauce, but the status of the claim was the same: false. No legitimate sources, media or governmental, have reported any such occurrence. Moreover, even if such an incident had occurred, it would not have resulted in the spread of AIDS. So say medical experts .
  No one is saying that it's absolutely impossible for HIV-tainted blood or other bodily fluids to find their way, accidentally or on purpose, into foods and beverages; the point is that, according to the best scientific evidence available, the AIDS virus simply can't be transmitted from one person to another in that way.
  This is how the CDC explains it:
  As stated in a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet last updated in 2010, no incidents of food or beverage products being contaminated with HIV-infected blood or semen, and no incidents of HIV infection transmitted via food or beverage products, have ever been documented by the agency.

  Text example: As shared on Facebook, July 19, 2014:
  {SHOCKING) Miley Cyrus Found Dead in Her Los Angeles Home! Country singer Miley Cyrus found overdosed this afternoon in her Los Angeles home.
  Analysis: Is Miley Cyrus dead? No, as of this writing she's alive and well. Check CNN.
  Check Fox News. Check the New York Times . You'll find that no legitimate media sources are reporting that she died.
  While Cyrus has indicated on more than one occasion that she enjoys occasional marijuana use, we have no reason to assume she uses harder drugs, nor is there any record of her being hospitalized for a drug overdose. In 2014, she explicitly denied rumors that the reason her 'Bangerz' tour had been cut short and she wound up in the hospital for several days was because of just such an overdose.
  'I didn't have a drug overdose,' Cyrus told People magazine . 'I took some sh––y antibiotics that a doctor gave me for a sinus infection and I had a reaction.'
  The Facebook blurb above is just another example of what has come to be known as a social media ' clickjacking scam ' (aka 'survey scam'). Users who take the bait and click on links in posts like the one above are redirected to a bogus Facebook page where they're prompted to share the advertised video before viewing it.
  Why? To cause that exact same post to be replicated on the user's page, where everyone who sees it will also be exposed to the scam.
  Users who share the video expecting an opportunity to actually view it should not hold their breath. At this point they will typically be shuffled off to yet another website where they're prompted to take an online survey — by which means the scammers make their money — and in many cases also to download free software of some kind or other (which they should not do under any circumstances, because it's almost certain to be some sort of Trojan horse virus or other malware).
  When, after all that trouble, do you actually get to see the video? Never. The video doesn't exist. You've been clickjacked !

"Robin Williams 'Goodbye' Video Is a Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/fl/Robin-Williams-Says-Goodbye-Video.htm","2016-08-23 06:41:41","  By David Emery
  It took less than 48 hours for online scammers to figure out a way to exploit the news of comedian Robin Williams' passing. A cynical clickjacking scam (aka 'survey scam') purporting to link to a phone video of Williams saying goodbye to his fans is now circulating via Facebook.
  Description: Viral Facebook blurbs Circulating since: Aug. 2014 Status: Scam
  As is usually the case with such scams, no such video exists. Users who attempt to view it are first asked to share the video with Facebook friends (which is how the scam is spread), then told that they must verify their identity by filling out an online survey form (which is how the scammers make their money). After following the instructions, users are left high and dry with no video to view, very possibly having exposed themselves to a malware attack in the process.
  'Think before you click,' advises Facebook's own security help page . 'Never click suspicious links, even if they come from a friend or a company you know.

  This includes links sent on Facebook (ex: in a chat or story) or in emails. If one of your friends clicks a spam link, they could accidentally send you or tag you in spammy posts. You also shouldn't download things (ex: a .exe file) if you aren’t sure what they are.' Clickjacking scams are usually recognizable by the lurid, sensational content they promote. Any time you are asked to share content before viewing it, beware.
  Robin Williams was found dead in his home of an apparent suicide on August 11, 2014.

  Analysis: While there's nothing particularly new about hackers using profile pictures and public information copied from real Facebook accounts to create phony ones (I've found warnings going back to 2008), the activity does exist and can pose a real security threat to users.
  It's called 'profile cloning,' described as follows in a 2012 article on 24/7 Wall Street :
  Impersonating Facebook members is illegal in some states and a violation of Facebook's Terms of Service. If you have reason to believe someone has created a fake account to impersonate you or another member, you can report it here .
  Generally speaking, it's wise to be prudent and discriminating about accepting friend requests on Facebook. Don't be hasty. When you receive a request, examine that person's profile for signs they may not be who they say they are. If you're not sure, contact them directly to make sure they sent the request before accepting.

""Giant Python Caught in the Red Sea" Video Is a Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Sylvester-Stallone-Died-in-Car-Accident-Hoax.htm","2014-11-20 13:57:07","  Description: Viral posts Circulating since: Sep. 2014 Status: Scam (see details below)
  Example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 17, 2014:
  [True Video] - Giant python caught in the Red Sea!
  The world biggest Snake has been found in SAAD - Karaj (Iran) it has 43m height and 6m Length and 103 yrs old, The sources gave him temporary oxygen for while until get cure and they called him (MAGA MAAR MALAD) Snake......
  Analysis: We've seen these images before. Staged using toy soldiers and an ordinary dead snake, they were created for display on a message board frequented by Vietnamese college students and gaming enthusiasts. In 2010 the images began making the social media rounds with various false stories attached, e.g., ' Amazing Giant Snake Found in the Red Sea .'
  This latest incarnation is a bait-and-switch tease for a clickjacking scam . Users who attempt to view the video are redirected to a bogus Facebook page where they're told it's 'mandatory' to share the video before they can see it. Once they've shared it -- spamming the scam to everyone on their friends list -- they're prompted to download special 'VideoPerformer' software which, if consented to, likely results in the installation of adware or malware on their computers.
  It pays to be careful when you're confronted with posts inviting you to view lurid videos or 'shocking news' updates. It's all too easy to compromise the security of your social media accounts, computer, and network to phishing and malware attacks.

  Analysis: Welcome to another social media clickjacking scam . Users who click on links in 'SHOCKING VIDEO' posts like these are typically redirected to a page where they're asked to share the video with everyone they know before viewing it — which alone ought to give one pause.
  Those who continue this far are then typically asked to take an online survey, which is how the perpetrators generate revenue.
  Completing the survey does not guarantee one will see the promised video, however, because typically there is no video. It's a classic bait and switch.
  Worst case scenario, careless users may expose themselves to a malware attack (one should be especially wary of links offering downloadable software of any kind) and end up with their account and/or network security compromised.

"What Is a Chain Letter?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/This-Baby-Has-Cancer-Hoax.htm","2016-02-21 17:28:13","  By David Emery
  Question: What is a chain letter?
  Answer: Simply defined, a chain letter is a written message that attempts to persuade recipients to copy, share or otherwise reproduce it. A typical specimen might say, for example, 'Please copy this letter and send it to 10 more people.' A common online variant might say, 'Forward this email to everyone you know!'
  The Good Luck of Flanders letter is a classic example from the 1930s and '40s. The Flanders letter promised prosperity to all who copied and resent it to four (or more) people within 24 hours, and bad luck to anyone who 'broke the chain' by failing to comply. Virtually all chain letters hold out some sort of reward for reproducing them, be it blessings, good luck, money or a clear conscience. On the flip side, there are threats of calamity or karmic punishment for failing to circulate the requisite number of copies: 'One person did not pass this letter along and died a week later.'
  However preposterous their claims, chain letters always play on the irrational wishes or fears of recipients — and often succeed.

  For those especially vulnerable to psychological manipulation they seem to exude an aura of mystical or quasi-mystical power.
  Chain letters that solicit money are against the law in the United States and many other countries. The U.S. Postal Service deems them illegal 'if they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants.' Because it's tantamount to gambling, sending such letters through the mail ('or delivering them in person or by computer, but mailing money to participate') violates Title 8, United States Code , Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute, according to the U.S. Postal Service. Pyramid schemes conducted by chain letter, including some versions of multi-level marketing , are also prohibited by law.
  Chain letters have existed in one form or another since the late 19th century, with precedents dating back almost a thousand years. The Prester John letter, a fictional missive purporting to originate from the ruler of a paradisaical 'land of honey and milk' in the East, circulated throughout Europe during the Middle Ages and is regarded as a progenitor of the genre.
  Without a doubt, the Internet has proven to be the greatest boon to the proliferation of chain letters since photocopy machines. Email messages, which can be forwarded to multiple recipients with the click of a button, are the ideal medium for this type of endeavor. Small wonder the Internet is glutted with them. For good or ill (most experienced users would say ill), chain letters are an online fact of life.
  With that have come special variations in chain letter form and content, including the invention of a popular new sub-genre: fear-mongering alerts and warnings about dangers ranging from criminal activities to health threats.
  Messages of this kind rarely offer substantiating evidence to support their claims. Most often, in fact, they purvey downright false information. Their true purpose is to provoke fear, and more importantly to spread it, not to inform. Often the forwarded texts are mere pranks or hoaxes. People who share them without validating their content may be credited with naive good intentions, but it's impossible to attribute anything other than cynical or self-serving motives to their original — and almost always anonymous — authors.
  Returning to our simple definition — a chain letter is a text that advocates its own reproduction — it bears noting that the typical email chain letter (or 'chain email,' as it's often called) is different from its traditional forbears in that it may also purport to convey important information. In this light it's comparable not only to a rumor, but to an old-fashioned handbill, say, or a photocopied flier, both of which in their day performed similar functions. But because the 'information' they contain is almost always false (or unverified at best) and conveyed in an emotionally manipulative way, in the end it remains accurate to say that online chain letters serve no real purpose apart from self-replication.

"The Top 5 Signs That Video You're About to Share Is a Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/tp/Top-5-Signs-the-Video-Youre-About-to-Share-Is-a-Scam.htm","2016-08-23 06:42:39","  All the major social media platforms are rife with 'clickjacking' scams using bait-and-switch tactics to lure users to websites where they're prompted to take marketing surveys and/or download questionable apps. Often, by the time people realize they've been tricked, it's too late. They've already spammed their friends by sharing the post and filling out pointless surveys, only to discover that the advertised video doesn't exist, or is about something completely different from what they were led to expect. Worst case scenario, they've unwittingly infected their computers with malicious software.
  Look for these signs to detect this type of scam before it's too late:
  Usually preceded by screaming parentheticals on the order of 'BREAKING NEWS,' 'SHOCKING VIDEO,' 'YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS,' or 'WHAT A HORROR,' most scam posts use macabre, prurient, sensationalized content to catch readers' attention and persuade them to click. Typical subject matter includes celebrity deaths, horrible accidents and catastrophes, grotesque medical conditions, and purportedly supernatural events.
  Here are some actual examples of 'scambait' headlines (don't worry, the following links go to articles about the scams, not the scams themselves):
  It's always a good idea to check the URL ( web address ) of any link you're about to click. Compare it to the purported source of the content and make sure it's the same. For example, if the post supposedly links to a news story from CNN or Fox News , check to see if 'CNN.com' or 'FoxNews.com' is in the URL. If it isn't, don't click! Also be wary of garbled, misspelled, or downright bizarre URLs such as 'NewzyPheedList.com,' 'HotBootyVideos.cz,' 'BreekingNews.ph,' or 'Mxfgcv.biz,' etc.
  If you've been incautious enough to click on one of these links, the next thing that would typically happen is you'd be redirected to an external website that's been phonied up so it looks like you're still on, say, Facebook, but in reality you're not (again, it's a good idea to check the URL for a clue as to where you've actually landed). The scammers want you to feel safe, like you're on familiar territory, because the next thing they want you to do isn't safe. They want you to share content you haven't been allowed to see yet.
  Before you comply with this instruction, ask yourself whether it makes sense for any legitimate promo to require you to share content before you get to see it. More importantly, ask yourself whether you really want to become a scammer's accomplice, because that, in essence, is what you would become. When you click 'Share This Video,' you cause the same post that lured you this far to appear not only on your own timeline, but on all your friends' news feeds as well, exposing that many more people to the scam. Even if you're not sure it's a scam, do you really want to take that chance?
  If you've clicked through this far, we're no longer talking about a video you're about to share, but rather one you have already shared and will probably soon regret sharing (e.g., when your friends figure out you're responsible for the scam post that has appeared on their page). The next action you take will determine whether or not you've been successfully scammed. If you're prompted to take an online survey and you do so, you've been successfully scammed, because that is how the scammers make their money. If you're prompted to download an app or special software and you do so, you've been successfully scammed, because frequently these downloads contain malware or can compromise the security of your social media accounts. Don't do it!

"Smartphone Pictures Pose Privacy Risks?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/business/ss/Smartphone-Pictures-Pose-Privacy-Risks.htm","2016-01-17 20:01:44","  Description: Viral video / Text Circulating since: Jan. 2013 Status: True (see details below)
  Text example: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 22, 2013:
  Warning if you take photos with your cell phone of your kids, grand kids, elderly family members -- WATCH THIS!
  This is truly alarming - please take the time to watch this video, AND TAKE THE RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS. At the end they'll tell you how to set your phone so you don't run this risk!
  PLEASE PASS THIS INFO TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO TAKES PICTURES WITH THEIR CELL OR SMART PHONE AND POSTS THEM ONLINE. Be sure to share with all your family and friends. This is important info, about what your posting pictures/info on your cell phones can do TO YOU!!! Too much technology out there these days so beware...........
  I had no idea this could happen from taking pictures on the blackberry or cell phone. It's scary.
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2vARzvWxwY Smartphone pictures pose privacy risks www.youtube.com Pictures you've e-mailed or uploaded from your smartphone could leak information that can threaten your safety or that of your children.
  Analysis: There's nothing particularly new in this warning — in fact, the news video cited in the post aired in 2010 — and it's a bit overblown, but the info is accurate enough to be worth heeding.
  Most smartphone users are probably aware that their devices use GPS location services to power maps, driving directions, phone locators, and other handy apps, but not everyone is aware that the same technology may pose a risk to their safety and privacy by recording precise geographical information in the photos they take (the feature is called ' geotagging '). The risk arises when the photos are shared.
  When you publicly share a geotagged photo via the Web or social media, the embedded data may, depending on the platform, be accessible to anyone with the proper software to extract it (some services, e.g. Facebook and Twitter , automatically delete location data from uploaded images; others don't). The software is easy to use, readily available, and in many instances free of charge. It's a simple matter to take the geographical coordinates of the location where the photo was shot — your own backyard, for example — convert them into map form, and voila: a total stranger knows your exact address.
  Fortunately, it's also a simple matter — and advisable if you plan on sharing your photos publicly — to disable the geotagging feature in your smartphone camera. See the resources below for specific instructions applicable to the most common devices.
  (Note: Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Google+ doesn't automatically remove location data from uploaded photos, but does offer users the option of hiding it. Instagram also makes displaying geotagged images, or not, optional.)

  2011 example: As shared on Facebook, Dec. 30, 2011:
  Analysis: ' Tipsy Tow ' (aka ' Tow-to-Go ' or ' Holiday Safe Ride Program ') is an actual service provided by AAA on New Year's Eve and other holidays in some U.S. cities and towns. Drinking drivers and their vehicles are transported home free of charge if they call the 800 number above and request it. You don't have to be a member of AAA to make use of the service.
  Here's how it works:
  During the period Tipsy Tow is available, drivers, potential passengers, party hosts, bartenders, and restaurant managers can call 800-222-4357 (AAA-HELP) for a free tow home of up to ten miles. Just tell the AAA operator, 'I need a Tipsy Tow,' and a truck will be on its way.
  The service will provide a one-way ride for the driver and vehicle to the driver's home. If there are additional passengers who need a ride, they will be taken to the driver's home as long is there is sufficient room for them to be transported safely in the tow truck. You cannot make a reservation.
  Contrary to what's commonly claimed, however, the Tipsy Tow program is not available nationwide. A list of participating AAA locations is available on the American Automobile Association website. Alternative sober/safe ride programs in other parts of the country are also provided.

  By accepting it, the user grants the app permission to post status updates, photos, 'and more' on his or her behalf.
  Needless to say, this is a bad idea. Installing a rogue app can compromise the security of your Facebook account, not to mention flood your timeline and email inbox with spam (or worse). If you've unintentionally installed such an app, follow Facebook's instructions for removing it, then delete all posts connected with it.

"SCAM: 'Worst Roller Coaster Accident in Sydney ' Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/Worst-Roller-Coaster-Accident-in-Sydney-Australia.htm","2014-06-02 14:29:34","  Description: Viral wall postings Circulating since: Jan. 2014 Status: SCAM (see details below)
  Analysis: This is a clickjacking scam (aka survey scam). As in previous examples (see below), users who click the link to view the advertised video are redirected to a fake Facebook page and asked to share the video before viewing it. After spamming their friends, users are then instructed to fill out a survey form (which is how the scammers make their money).
  In some cases, malicious software may be downloaded to the user's computer. At no point will the user actually get to see the advertised video, which in fact does not exist.
  Think before you click!

"SCAM: "OMG Teen Died Immediately After Friends Did This" Video","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/facebook/ss/OMG-Teen-Died-Immediately-Video-Scam.htm","2016-02-07 19:37:44","  Description: Viral wall postings Circulating since: April 2014 Status: Scam
  Analysis: No such video exists. It's a clickjacking scam . The lurid Facebook post you see above is designed to sucker users into clicking on links which redirect them to other websites where they're offered the 'opportunity' to take surveys and view promotional materials. Not very exciting. It's a classic bait and switch scam.
  We've seen similar ones before.
  The scam is spread by users themselves. The first instruction they're given when they try to view the video is to share it with their entire friend list. Embarrassingly for them, many people do. (Rule of thumb: don't share stuff before you even look at it.)
  Worst case scenario, uncareful users may expose themselves to a malware attack (be especially wary of links offering downloadable software of any kind) and end up with their account and/or network security compromised.
