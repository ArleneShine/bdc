"Alligators in the Sewers","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/alligators/a/sewer_gators.htm","2016-06-25 14:13:49","  By David Emery
  Legend has it...
  It was once a fad among New Yorkers vacationing in Florida to bring back baby alligators for their children to raise as pets. These infant gators eventually grew up and outlived their cuteness, sad to say, at which point their desperate owners flushed them down the toilet to get rid of them.
  Some of these hastily disposed-of saurians managed to survive and breed in the dank Manhattan sewer system, so the story goes, producing colonies of giant, albino alligators beneath the streets of New York City. Their descendants thrive down there to this day, completely hidden — apart from the rare heart-stopping encounter between sewer gator and sewer worker, that is — from human eyes.
  Analysis: I love this story as much as the next guy, but it's folklore, not fact. Herpetologists pooh-pooh the very idea of alligators thriving in the New York City sewer system. It's cold down there most of the time, they point out — freezing cold during the winter — and alligators require a warm environment year-round to survive, much less reproduce and burgeon into colonies.

  If the cold weather didn't kill them off, the polluted sewer water certainly would.
  There's a grain of truth at the heart of this decades-old urban legend, however, namely the documented capture of an eight-foot-long alligator at the bottom of an East Harlem manhole in 1935 — though no one at the time assumed the creature actually lived down there. Instead, it was theorized that the 'gator probably tumbled off a steamer visiting the northeast 'from the mysterious Everglades, or thereabouts,' then swam up the Harlem River. It met an unfortunate end at the hands of the teenage boys who found it.
  The earliest published reference to alligators in the sewer -- in what Jan Harold Brunvand refers to as the 'standardized' form of the urban legend ('baby alligator pets, flushed, thrived in sewers') — can be found in the 1959 book, The World Beneath the City , a history of public utilities in New York City written by Robert Daley. Daley's source was a retired sewer official named Teddy May, who claimed that during his tenure in the 1930s he personally investigated workers' reports of subterranean saurians and saw a colony of them with his own eyes. He also claimed to have supervised their eradication. May was a colorful storyteller, if not a particularly reliable one.
  The tale was well known throughout the United States by the late 1960s, when, according to folklorist Richard M. Dorson, it came to be associated with another icon of sewer lore, the mythical 'New York White' — an especially potent, albino strain of marijuana growing wild from seeds spilled out of baggies hastily flushed down toilets during drug raids. Not that anyone had ever actually seen the stuff, much less smoked it. It was impossible to harvest, you see, because of all the alligators down there.
  Adding fodder to the legend is the intriguing fact that wayward alligators — escaped or abandoned pets, we assume — do occasionally turn up in the streets of New York City, and never fail to cause a ruckus. For example:
  • June 2001 - A small alligator (actually a caiman, as it turned out) was spotted and eventually captured in Central Park .
  • November 2006 - A two-foot-long caiman is captured outside an apartment building in Brooklyn. Police say it 'snapped and hissed' at them.
  • August 2010 - A two-foot-long alligator was captured in Queens after eyewitnesses spotted it hiding under a parked car.
  'What could better serve as a metaphor for the city as a jungle than the belief that the New York sewer system is filled with albino alligators, which swim through toilet pipes and bite victims in public washrooms?' — Gary Alan Fine, folklorist
  'The theme of displaced creatures is an old one, and modern folklore has spawned many rumors of an animal — usually a fearsome one — lurking where it does not belong.' — Jan Harold Brunvand, folklorist
  'I would bring leftovers from lunch, a long line and a hook, and spend a part of each day in the sewers looking for alligators. I saw rats, cockroaches — probably caught a lot of sicknesses — but I never saw anything like an alligator.' — Frank Indiviglio, herpetologist
  'It’s like the Loch Ness Monster or the Big Foot. People believe in those stories up to a point that it does make sense.' — Esteban Rodriguez, NYC sewer worker

"The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/The-Babysitter-And-The-Man-Upstairs.htm","2015-07-09 13:31:44","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Andy B.:
  A married couple were going out for the evening and called in a teenage babysitter to take care of their three children. When she arrived they told her they probably wouldn't be back until late, and that the kids were already asleep so she needn't disturb them.
  The babysitter starts doing her homework while awaiting a call from her boyfriend. After awhile the phone rings. She answers it, but hears no one on the other end — just silence, then whoever it is hangs up. After a few more minutes the phone rings again. She answers, and this time there's a man on the line who says, in a chilling voice, 'Have you checked the children?'
  Click.
  At first she thinks it might have been the father calling to check up and he got interrupted, so she decides to ignore it. She goes back to her homework, then the phone rings again. 'Have you checked the children?' says the creepy voice on the other end.
  'Mr. Murphy?' she asks, but the caller hangs up again.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  She decides to phone the restaurant where the parents said they'd be dining, but when she asks for Mr. Murphy she is told that he and his wife had left the restaurant 45 minutes earlier. So she calls the police and reports that a stranger has been calling her and hanging up. 'Has he threatened you?' the dispatcher asks. No, she says. 'Well, there's nothing we can really do about it. You could try reporting the prank caller to the phone company.'
  A few minutes go by and she gets another call. 'Why haven't you checked the children?' the voice says.
  'Who is this?' she asks, but he hangs up again. She dials 911 again and says, 'I'm scared. I know he's out there, he's watching me.'
  'Have you seen him?' the dispatcher asks. She says no. 'Well, there isn't much we can do about it,' the dispatcher says. The babysitter goes into panic mode and pleads with him to help her. 'Now, now, it'll be okay,' he says. 'Give me your number and street address, and if you can keep this guy on the phone for at least a minute we'll try to trace the call. What was your name again?'
  'Linda.'
  'Okay, Linda, if he calls back we'll do our best to trace the call, but just keep calm. Can you do that for me?'
  'Yes,' she says, and hangs up. She decides to turn the lights down so she can see if anyone's outside, and that's when she gets another call.
  'It's me,' the familiar voice says. 'Why did you turn the lights down?'
  'Can you see me?' she asks, panicking.
  'Yes,' he says after a long pause.
  'Look, you've scared me,' she says. 'I'm shaking. Are you happy? Is that what you wanted?'
  'No.'
  'Then what do you want?' she asks.
  Another long pause. 'Your blood. All over me.'
  She slams the phone down, terrified. Almost immediately it rings again. 'Leave me alone!' she screams, but it's the dispatcher calling back. His voice is urgent.
  'Linda, we've traced that call. It's coming from another room inside the house. Get out of there! Now!!!'
  She tears to the front door, attempting to unlock it and dash outside, only to find the chain at the top still latched. In the time it takes her to unhook it she sees a door open at the top of the stairs. Light streams from the children's bedroom, revealing the profile of a man standing just inside.
  She finally gets the door open and bursts outside, only to find a cop standing on the doorstep with his gun drawn. At this point she's safe, of course, but when they capture the intruder and drag him downstairs in handcuffs, she sees he is covered in blood. Come to find out, all three children have all been murdered.
  Analysis: Teenagers have been scaring each other silly with this urban legend since the late 1960s, though most people nowadays are probably more familiar with it as the plot of the 1979 horror film When a Stranger Calls (or the 2006 remake of the same title). It's not based on any real-life incident, so far as anyone knows, but the scenario is plausible enough to give goosebumps to anyone with a sense of what it's like to be young and inexperienced and alone in a big house caring for someone else's children.
  'The most frightening aspect of this legend is that the babysitter is not in control at any time,' writes folklorist Gail De Vos. '[T]he caller multiplies the anxiety that the babysitter is already feeling as the responsible person in the household. The possibility that this could actually happen is never far from the mind of any babysitter.'
  Never mind the unlikelihood that police would be able to trace a phone call that lasted no more than 20 seconds at most, or that an officer could be dispatched to the house so quickly. Albeit framed as a cautionary tale , the main purpose of the story is to frighten us, not give us actionable information. That it's still going around some 40 years later is a testament to how successfully it accomplishes its goal.

"Biscuits for Brains","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/biscuit_brain.htm","2015-10-15 14:46:08","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Brain Drain,' 'The Killer Biscuits,' 'Killer Biscuits Wanted for Attempted Murder,' etc.
  As told by reader Vanessa Berger...
  There was a sweet older lady who would often do grocery shopping for the infirm and elderly in her church. One hot, summer day a lady asked her to pick up a few things and bring them by her house in a dangerous part of Baltimore City. The sweet old lady was wary but felt that she couldn't say no, even though she was terrified of driving in the part of the city that often had shoot-outs and other drug violence. Anyway, the woman went on her way, picked up the groceries and proceeded to the lady's house.
  As she entered the lady's neighborhood she noticed young hoodlums gathering on every street corner. Although she had no air conditioning in the car, she rolled the windows up tightly (as a safety precaution) and suffered in the 90+ degree heat.
  She drove ahead until suddenly she heard a loud 'POP!' and felt a jolt to the back of her head. She reached to feel the back of her head and came back with a wet oozing mess that she was sure was part of her brain! Knowing that she had been shot, the woman turned around and raced to a local hospital.

  Somehow she made it to the emergency room and had the strength to walk right in. She told the attendant that she had been shot. Immediately she was rushed back to an exam room. Doctors whirled around and asked where she had been shot (since they saw no blood.) She said 'my head,' and the doctors found a mass of the oozing white substance the woman had first noticed.
  Upon inspection the doctors realized that the white substance wasn't part of her brain but was instead a lump of biscuit dough (the kind in a can) that had exploded from the heat of her car!
  Analysis: Vanessa's marvelous retelling of this popular tale (which has also been circulating as a viral email since around 1998) has all the vivacity and attention to detail of an old-fashioned, word-of-mouth urban legend. Her uncle swears it really happened to a 'sweet old lady' in his church. In all likelihood, of course, it did not.
  As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported in his 1999 book Too Good to Be True , the story he calls 'The Brain Drain' first began showing up in newspaper columns, stand-up comedy routines , and Internet discussions during the mid-1990s. A Usenet forum posting dated July 18, 1995 attributes it to comedienne Brett Butler:
  Sue, have you ever heard Brett Butler's story about her sister-in-law (or some such relative): driving home from the grocery store with a bag of groceries in the seat behind her; it was unbelievably hot weather; she stopped at a convenience store to get a soda or something and started toward home again. All of a sudden she heard this really loud explosion and felt something hit her in the back of the head. She put her hand up (but not too close) and felt something mushy. She was convinced she had been shot and her brains were falling out!
  When she finally pulled into her driveway and started screaming/honking for someone to come out and help her, they discovered a can of biscuits in the grocery bag had exploded and hit her in the head. Ha ha ha.
  In August 1995 the story was retold by a paramedic as follows:
  One of our trucks recently were toned to respond to the GSW to the head. The victim called 911 via her cellular phone. She told the operator that she just sat down in her car and someone shot her in the back of the head. She told the dispatched that she was afraid to move because she could feel brain tissue hanging out the back of her head.
  When the crew arrived, they found the woman sitting in the front seat. Her groceries were in the back seat. The Medics found dough where the woman thought that she felt brain tissue. A can of biscuit dough in the shopping bag exploded and hit her in the back of the head. Needless to say, the woman was greatly relieved to find that out.
  'Funny but true,' the author went on to write — and in that three-word statement is encapsulated the critical distinction between a joke and an urban legend .

"The Body Under the Bed","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/body_in_bed.htm","2016-02-07 17:50:50","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Autumn Murphy...
  A man and woman went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, and checked into a suite at a hotel. When they got to their room they both detected a bad odor. The husband called down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the room smelled very bad and they would like another suite. The manager apologized and told the man that they were all booked because of a convention. He offered to send them to a restaurant of their choice for lunch compliments of the hotel and said he was going to send a maid up to their room to clean and to try and get rid of the odor.
  After a nice lunch the couple went back to their room. When they walked in they could both still smell the same odor. Again the husband called the front desk and told the manager that the room still smelled really bad. The manager told the man that they would try and find a suite at another hotel. He called every hotel on the strip, but every hotel was sold out because of the convention. The manager told the couple that they couldn't find them a room anywhere, but they would try and clean the room again. The couple wanted to see the sights and do a little gambling anyway, so they said they would give them two hours to clean and then they would be back.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  When the couple had left, the manager and all of housekeeping went to the room to try and find what was making the room smell so bad. They searched the entire room and found nothing, so the maids changed the sheets, changed the towels, took down the curtains and put new ones up, cleaned the carpet and cleaned the suite again using the strongest cleaning products they had. The couple came back two hours later to find the room still had a bad odor. The husband was so angry at this point, he decided to find whatever this smell was himself. So he started tearing the entire suite apart himself.
  As he pulled the top mattress off the box spring he found a dead body of a woman.
  Analysis: It only takes one dead body under the mattress to spoil your whole honeymoon.
  Befitting its 'Sin City' reputation, Las Vegas has been the setting of some horrific urban legends (see ' The Kidney Snatchers ' if you don't know what I mean). What sets 'The Body in the Bed' apart from the rest is how frequently incidents resembling the one described above have actually happened in real life — just never, to my knowledge, in Las Vegas !
  The closest encounter between fact and legend I've been able to document took place in Atlantic City (another gambling mecca, naturally) in 1999. This account comes from the Bergen Record :
  The body of Saul Hernandez, 64, of Manhattan was found in Room 112 of the Burgundy Motor Inn after two German tourists slept overnight in the bed despite a rancid smell that prompted them to complain to the front desk.
  The couple told motel officials about the smell Wednesday night but stayed in the $36-a-night room anyway. On Thursday, they complained again and were given a new room while a motel housekeeper cleaned Room 112.
  In July 2003, a cleaning crew discovered a dead body stuffed under the mattress in a room at the Capri Motel in Kansas City, Missouri. This report was filed by KMBC-TV News:
  Police said that the man appeared to have been dead for some time, but the body went unnoticed until a guest staying the room could no longer tolerate the smell.
  Officers were called to the Capri Motel in the 1400 block of Independence Avenue around noon Sunday after cleaning crews made the grisly discovery.
  KMBC's Emily Aylward reported that the man who checked into the motel room a few days ago complained to management about the odor two times over the three days. He then checked out on Sunday because he could not tolerate the smell.
  In March 2010, Memphis police responded to a call from a local motel where employees had noticed a 'foul odor' in one of the rooms. According to ABC Eyewitness News:
  On March 15th, investigators were called back to room 222 at the Budget Inn, where the body of Sony Millbrook was found under the bed. Police say she was found inside the metal box frame that sits directly on the floor after someone reported smelling a strange odor. The box springs and mattress fit into the top of the bed frame.
  Room 222, according to investigators, had been rented 5 times and cleaned many times by the hotel staff since the day Millbrook was reported missing.
  Homicide investigators say Millbrook appears to have been murdered.
  There's more than one moral to these story, to be sure, but the most disturbing of all is that urban legends do sometimes come true.

"The Dead Boyfriend","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/boyfriend_death.htm","2015-03-02 04:35:56","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Boyfriend's Death' and 'The Mad Axeman'
  Example #1: As told by Shirley Pugh...
  A girl and her boyfriend are making out in his car. They had parked in the woods so no one would see them. When they were done, the boy got out to pee and the girl waited for him in the safety of the car.
  After waiting five minutes, the girl got out of the car to look for her boyfriend. Suddenly, she sees a man in the shadows. Scared, she gets back in the car to drive away, when she hears a very faint squeak... squeak... squeak...
  This continued a few seconds until the girl decided she had no choice but to drive off. She hit the gas as hard as possible but couldn't go anywhere, because someone had tied a rope from the bumper of the car to a nearby tree.
  Well, the girl slams on the gas again and then hears a loud scream. She gets out of the car and realizes that her boyfriend is hanging from the tree. The squeaky noises were his shoes slightly scraping across the top of the car!!!

  Example #2: As told by Isabel Espaldon...
  Here's a story my mom told to me and my friends when I was about seven years old. You can imagine I was scared to death...
  A woman and her boyfriend were on their way home from somewhere (not important) one night, and suddenly his car ran out of gas. It was about one in the morning and they were completely alone in the middle of the nowhere.
  The guy stepped out of the car, saying comfortingly to his girlfriend, 'Don't worry, I'll be right back. I'm just going to go out for some help. Lock the doors, though.'
  She locked the doors and sat restlessly, waiting for her boyfriend to come back. Suddenly, she sees a shadow fall across her lap. She looks up to see... not her boyfriend, but a strange, crazed looking man. He is swinging something in his right hand.
  He sticks his face close to the window and slowly pulls up his right hand. In it is her boyfriend's decapitated head, twisted horribly in pain and shock. She shuts her eyes in horror and tries to make the image go away. When she opens her eyes, the man is still there, grinning psychotically. He slowly lifts his left hand, and he is holding her boyfriend's keys... to the car.
  Analysis: 'The Dead Boyfriend' is reminiscent of the hook-man urban legend , in which a pair of teenagers necking on Lovers' Lane race off in a fright after hearing a radio alert about a murderer on the loose with a hook for a hand. On returning home they discover, to their horror, a bloody hook dangling from one of the car door handles.
  Whereas the protagonists of 'The Hook' escape with their lives, the present tale concludes with the boyfriend murdered and the girlfriend in fatal jeopardy (though in some variants she is ultimately rescued by passersby). Folklorists regard both narratives as examples of cautionary tales but tend to interpret their meanings differently. 'The Hook' is usually read as a warning against adolescent sexual activity; 'The Dead Boyfriend' has been interpreted as a more generalized warning not to stray too far from the safety of home. 'On a literal level a story like 'The Boyfriend's Death' simply warns young people to avoid situations in which they may be endangered,' writes folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, 'but at a more symbolic level the story reveals society's broader fears of people, especially women and the young, being alone and among strangers in the darkened world outside the security of their own home or car.' ( The Vanishing Hitchhiker , W.W. Norton, 1981.)
  Thematically, ' campfire stories ' such as these have much in common with the plot lines of modern horror movies, but there is an important difference. Typically, the villains in slasher films exhibit supernatural traits such as inhuman strength and 'unkillability' (e.g., Michael Myers in Halloween and Freddie in Nightmare on Elm Street ), while the hook-handed madmen and crazed axe murderers of urban legendry are only slightly exaggerated versions of the real-life serial killers we read about in newspaper headlines .

"Bride-and-Seek (The Missing Bride)","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/a/The-Missing-Bride.htm","2017-01-05 15:10:04","  By David Emery
  After a lavish wedding in a stately mansion, members of the wedding party play a game of hide-and-seek. It isn't long before everyone is found. Everyone, that is, except the bride. This urban legend is also known as 'The Lost Bride,' 'Bride-and-Go-Seek,' 'Ginevra,' 'The Mistletoe Bough,' 'The Mistletoe Bride,' 'The Bride in the Oak Chest,' 'The Bride in the Trunk.'
  As told by a reader:
  A young woman was about to get married, and she decided she wanted to hold the wedding in the backyard of the large farmhouse where she grew up. It was a beautiful wedding, and everything went perfectly.
  Afterward, the guests played some casual party games, and someone suggested hide-and-seek so they could get the children to play too. It wouldn't be hard to find a place to hide around the house.
  The groom was 'it,' and the bride wanted to make sure that she won the game. When no one was looking, she slipped inside the house. She ran up to the attic, found an old trunk and hid in it.
  continue reading below our video
  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  No one could find her. Her new husband wasn't worried, though, he figured she must have just gotten tired and went inside to rest. So everyone went home.
  The groom looked around the house, but he couldn't find her anywhere. He and her parents filed a missing person case, but she was never found.
  A few years later when her mother died, the woman's father went to go through his late wife's things that were collecting dust in the attic. He came to an old chest. The lid was closed, and the old lock was rusted over and holding it closed. He opened the lid and was terrified to see his daughter's decaying body in the chest. When she hid there, the lid had closed, and the rusty parts of the lock had latched together, trapping her there.
  As told by a reader:
  Back in '75 a young couple, both 18, decided to get married right after high school. The father of the bride lived in Palm Beach in a mansion and was able to afford a big wedding for them. To make a long story short, they got married, and the wedding was beautiful.
  After the wedding, they had a big reception in an old building, and everyone got pretty drunk. When there were only about 20 people left, the groom decided that they should play hide-and-seek. Everyone agreed, and the groom was 'it.' They all went and hid, and the game went on.
  After about 20 minutes everyone had been found except the bride. Everyone looked everywhere and tore the whole place apart looking for her. After a few hours, the groom was furious, thinking the bride was playing a terrible trick. Eventually, everyone went home.
  A few weeks later the groom, having placed a missing person report, gave up looking for her. Heartbroken, he tried to go on with his life.
  Three years later a little old woman was cleaning the place up. She happened to be in the attic and saw an old trunk. She dusted it off, and, out of curiosity, opened it. She screamed at the top of her lungs, ran out of the building and called the police.
  Apparently, the bride had decided to hide in the trunk for the game of hide-and-seek. When she sat down, the lid fell, knocking her unconscious and locking her inside. She suffocated after a day or so. When the woman found her, she was rotting, her mouth in the shape of a scream.
  As told by a reader:
  A bride and a groom were both very young, around 16, but decided to get married anyway, as was the way in those days. It was a huge, elaborate wedding and the reception was held at an old mansion, an heirloom of the family, of sorts.
  After most people had left and all were drunk of wedding champagne, the bride whined she was getting bored. When asked what she'd like to do, she grinned and said she always loved a good game of hide-and-seek. Though reluctant to play such a childish game, all agreed and the maid of honor was 'it.'
  It took only about 30 minutes for all to be found... all but the bride, that is. Everyone began searching the entire house, but no one found her. The groom, thinking maybe she had second thoughts about the marriage, grew angry and sent everyone home. After two or three days, he put out a missing persons report but no luck. Eventually, he moved on with his life.
  After the girl's father had died, the mansion was being cleaned, the family taking what they would before the auction came around. The mother of the long-gone bride ​was up in the storage attic, cleaning out the old clothes and junk when she saw an old trunk with a lock on it. After breaking the lock, she peered inside... and began to scream. All ran upstairs to see what was happening.
  Inside the trunk was the bride, dead after the lid fell on her head and crushed part of her skull... though she was still grinning at her little game of hide-and-seek.
  Even though one of the variants above takes place in modern-day Palm Beach, Florida, its Gothic flavor betrays the true longevity of this legend, which is at least 200 years old, probably more.
  The earliest version I've found in print is an anonymous newspaper article published in 1809 entitled ' A Melancholy Occurrence .' It opens with the announcement of a 'singular and calamitous event' in Germany, an incident 'long involved in the deepest mystery.' It ends, as above, with the discovery of a crumbling skeleton in an old, forgotten trunk — a trunk in which a newlywed bride had inadvertently locked herself and 'miserably perished' years before.
  The best-known version is an English ballad still sung at Christmastime on both sides of the Atlantic, ' The Mistletoe Bough ,' written by Thomas Haynes Bayly and set to music by Sir Henry Thomas around 1830.
  Bayly, it's said, took his inspiration from ' Ginevra ,' a rendition set in the palace of an Italian nobleman by the British poet Samuel Rogers, who included it in his volume Italy, a Poem in 1822. Rogers made an interesting admission in the endnotes of that book, namely that while he believed the tale to be based on fact, 'the time and place are uncertain. Many old houses in England lay claim to it.'
  Among those old houses are Minster Lovell Hall in Oxfordshire, Marwell Hall, Hampshire, Bramshill House , also in Hampshire, Tiverton Castle in Devon, and Exton Hall , Rutland (the list goes on). Each of the locales boasts a ghost story based on the legend. The ruins of Minster Lovell Hall have long been reputed to be haunted by a 'White Lady,' for example, identified by locals as the restless spirit of 'the mistletoe bride.' The phantom was mentioned in a New York Times article dated Dec. 28, 1924:
  Some 70 miles away, the halls of Bramshill House (now a Police College) have been said for at least 150 years to be haunted by an identical apparition, as noted by George Edward Jeans in Memorials of Old Hampshire , 1906:
  Despite the persistence of the legend in so many locales over so long a period, there's no historical evidence that any such event ever took place.

"What a Space Shuttle Launch Costs","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/space/ss/Cost-Of-Space-Shuttle-Launch.htm","2011-07-12 10:56:41","  Each space shuttle launch cost American taxpayers between several hundred million dollars and more than a billion dollars, depending on who you believe. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration pegged the average shuttle launch cost at $450 million.
  See also: NASA Names Shuttle Display Sites
  But science policy researchers estimated the each shuttle launch cost at being far more expensive - as much as three times more.
  Roger Pielke Jr. and Radford Byerly, of the University of Colorado in Boulder, reported that the U.S. government and NASA spent nearly $200 billion total on the space shuttle program.
  NASA's program began in 1981 with the launch of space shuttle Columbia and concluded with the launch of Atlantis in July 2011. Over those 20 years, there have been 134 missions. That brings the average shuttle launch cost to about $1.5 billion, according to Pielke and Byerly, writing in the international weekly journal of science Nature .
  The researchers said each shuttle launch cost about $1.2 billion from the time Columbia launched and 2010. But when factoring in the lifetime costs of the shuttle program dating back to the early 1970s the average shuttle launch cost rose to about $1.5 billion per flight.
  The shuttles cost in the billions of dollars. Endeavour , the orbiter built to replace Challenger, cost about $1.7 billion, according to NASA.
  For a little perspective, here's what The Associated Press said: 'America spent more on the space shuttle than the combined cost of soaring to the moon, creating the atom bomb, and digging the Panama Canal.'

"The Choking Doberman","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/chokingdoberman.htm","2015-03-12 16:24:39","  By David Emery
  As told by Lisa Foley...
  My cousin and his wife lived in Sydney with this huge doberman in a little apartment off Maroubra Road. One night they went out for dinner and a spot of clubbing. By the time they got home it was late and my cousin was more than a little drunk. They got in the door and were greeted by the dog choking to death in the loungeroom.
  My cousin just fainted, but his wife rang the veterinarian, who was an old family friend of hers, and got her to agree to meet her at the surgery. The wife drives over and drops off the dog, but decides that she'd better go home and get her hubby into bed.
  She gets home and finally slaps my cousin into consciousness, but he's still drunk. It takes her almost half an hour to get him up the stairs, and then the phone rings. She's tempted to just leave it, but she decides that it must be important or they wouldn't be ringing that late at night. As soon as she picks up the phone, she hears the vet's voice screaming out:

  'Thank God I got you in time! Leave the house! Now! No time to explain!' Then the vet hangs up.
  Because she's such an old family friend, the wife trusts her, and so she starts getting the hubby down the stairs and out of the house. By the time they've made it all the way out, the police are outside. They rush up the front stairs past the couple and into the house, but my cousin's wife still doesn't have a clue what's going on.
  The vet shows up and says, 'Have they got him? Have they got him?'
  'Have they got who?' says the wife, starting to get really pissed off.
  'Well, I found out what the dog was choking on – it was a human finger.'
  Just then the police drag out a dirty, stubbly man who is bleeding profusely from one hand. 'Hey Sarge,' one of them yells. 'We found him in the bedroom.'
  Analysis: 'The Choking Doberman' has circulated in more or less this form for at least three decades, on as many continents. In his book of the same title, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand cites a plethora of known variants, including a British version dating back to 1973. The legend became hugely popular in the United States during the early 1980s. It was published as an allegedly firsthand account in an American tabloid called The Globe in 1981, though subsequent research revealed that the pseudonymous author ('Gayla Crabtree') had actually heard the story secondhand in a beauty parlor.
  Folklorists believe 'The Choking Doberman' is a descendant of a much older (perhaps as old as the Renaissance) European folktale about a clumsy thief whose hand is either injured or amputated while committing a crime, marking him as the perpetrator. Among other interpretations it can be read as a 'just deserts' tale in which the criminal, as a result of his own actions, undergoes a punishment appropriate to the crime.

"The Death of Little Mikey by Pop Rocks and Soda","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/little_mikey.htm","2017-01-06 13:48:22","  By David Emery
  Did Little Mikey from the Life cereal commercial die by eating pop rocks and soda? Explore this urban legend.
  Here's the legend described by one person who heard it:
  In the Life cereal television ads, two boys are reluctant to try the cereal because their mother said it would be good for them. They decide to give it to Mikey because 'He hates everything.' But Little Mikey takes a bite and then enthusiastically enjoys the cereal.
  The rumor on the playground at the time was that Little Mikey ate a whole bag of Pop Rocks candy, which are little candies that crackled on your tongue and popped in your mouth, and drank a can of Coke quickly. Supposedly, Mikey's stomach exploded from the combination of the fatal candy and soda mix and he died.
  Needless to say, most of my friends were scared to eat the stuff ever again. But some of the braver kids tried pop rocks and soda. The only thing that exploded on them were the contents of their stomachs all over the place (i.e., they puked).

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Few Baby Boomers can forget those ubiquitous TV commercials of the early '70s and the immortal catchphrase, ' Mikey likes it '?
  Likewise, the original roll-out of Pop Rocks candy by General Mills a few years later was unforgettable. The one-of-a-kind confection, which looked like gravel and crackled on your tongue, proved to be wildly popular. That is, until around 1977 when rumors began circulating to the effect that kids had actually died after eating them, either from suffocation or a burst stomach.
  One version, which said the doomed children had imbibed a carbonated soft drink at the same time, became particularly virulent and by 1979 had morphed into the claim that it happened to one specific child, the actor who had played Little Mikey in the Life cereal commercials.
  Mind you, none of the variants of this story were true. No one was ever injured, let alone killed, by consuming Pop Rocks, with or without soda. The fact is, a packet of the candy contains no more carbon dioxide than a soft drink. It might make you burp, at worst .
  Unfortunately, the boy who played Little Mikey at the age of three never achieved much fame outside of those commercials and, by the late '70s, had seemingly vanished from sight. This gave the rumor legs, and sales began to suffer.
  Despite an effort to dispel the falsehood by taking out full-page ads in dozens of newspapers across the country and mailing explanatory letters to 50,000 school principals, misinformation prevailed, and General Foods was forced to pull Pop Rocks from the market in 1980. The rumor died with the candy.
  Pop Rocks enjoyed a resurgence five years later when the patent changed hands, and have been off and on the market since as different companies bought and sold the rights.
  Proof positive that Pop Rocks and Coke didn't kill Little Mikey is the fact that his real-life alter ego, John Gilchrist , survived to adulthood and a career as an ad executive in the broadcast industry. He was too young at age three and a half to remember anything about filming the Life cereal commercial.
  Mikey and Pop Rocks have seemingly entered into the realm of a classic urban legend and references live on in film, television, and music, including a mention in the film 'Urban Legend' in 1999, in the lyrics in a song in 'Shrek: The Musical,' and many more.
  The MythBusters television show explored whether Pop Rocks and soda could prove fatal and disproved the myth.

  As told by a reader:
  A mechanic is driving down the street and notices a Mercedes pulled over on the side of the road.  The mechanic pulls over and offers to help the stranded motorist, whom he recognizes to be Donald Trump.  Mr. Trump at first was wary of the man's offer, but as he was stranded he decided to accept.
  The car is fixed in no time, and the man declines Trump's repeated offer of a reward.  Finally, the man gives in and tells the real estate magnate that if he really wants to reward him, would he send flowers to his wife?  It's their anniversary, and she would really get a kick out of that, he says.
  The next day the mechanic's wife receives four dozen roses.  The card, signed by Donald Trump, read: 'Happy anniversary.  By the way, I have paid off your mortgage.'
  As told by a reader:
  A man is driving on a deserted road and comes to see a man on the side of that road with a flat tire. The driver stops his car and offers to help. When he is done, the grateful man asks him for his address to send him a reward for helping him. The helpful man declines and declines, but finally gives in. Then both man get in their cars and drive off.

  Two weeks later, the man receives a letter in the mail that says: 'Thank you for helping me, here is a little something to say thanks. Signed, Donald Trump.'
  Inside is a check for $10,000.
  As told by a reader:
  An auto mechanic who specialized in BMWs was driving on Interstate 5 and spotted a BMW on the shoulder of the road, with the driver standing beside it. The mechanic stopped and asked if there was anything he could help with. The driver thanked him and explained that he had called BMW's roadside assistance line and was now just waiting for the BMW person to show up.
  The mechanic offered his business card and explained that he specialized in repairing BMWs, again offering to see if he could help, with no obligation. Perhaps he could save the driver a long wait. Again, he was thanked for the offer and turned down politely.
  He insisted and was finally allowed to look at the car. He found nothing more than a loose wire, reattached it, and the car ran fine.
  The driver turned out to be Bill Gates.
  Mysteriously, the mechanic's house mortgage was fully paid up the next week.
  Analysis: I'm told that billionaire Donald Trump corroborated this story — the version that applies to him, at any rate — during a 2005 episode of Celebrity Apprentice . Good on him.
  While he certainly could be telling the truth, we have reason to be skeptical, however, not least because many other famous people — Bill Gates, Perry Como, Louis Armstrong, Mrs. Nat King Cole and Leon Spinks, to cite just a few — have been named as the grateful celebrity in variants of this selfsame tale told before and after the Trump version began circulating. According to folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand there are versions dating back to the 1950s, when Donald Trump was but a lad.
  True or false, we're drawn to urban legends like these because they humanize larger-than-life public figures we ordinarily only get to observe from afar. For my money, the crucial moment in the narrative isn't when Trump or Bill Gates rewards the good Samaritan for his or her good deed — it comes before that, when the celebrity of choice is revealed to be vulnerable and needing help from a stranger, as if he were an ordinary mortal no different from you or me. The quasi-mythological figure is brought down to earth.
  We love snooty celebrity comeuppance stories for the same reason. We revere the rich and famous, but it's a reverence tinged with envy.

"The Exploding Cactus","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/cactus.htm","2015-01-15 20:04:55","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Spiders in the Cactus' and 'The Spider in the Yucca'
  Example #1: As told by reader Ileen Verble...
  A woman goes to buy a large cactus from a nursery, and brings it home. Later that day she notices something very odd. The cactus appears to be breathing! She calls the nursery she purchased the cactus from and says, 'I know this sounds crazy, but I think my cactus is breathing.'
  The woman she is speaking to tells her to immediately get out of the house, and that she (the nursery woman) is going to call the bomb squad. The bomb squad comes to the house and loads the cactus into a van. Just as they get it into the van, the cactus explodes and out come thousands of scorpions!
  It seems that several scorpions had laid their eggs in the cactus, and they all hatched at once.
  Example #2: As told by reader Carolyn Lamb...
  There was once a lady who lived in a house by herself. She had a lot of potted plants. One day, she noticed that the skin on the cactus in her living room was moving. It gave her the creeps, but then it stopped. She decided she must have imagined it.

  Later that day, she was talking to one of her friends. She mentioned how her cactus had been moving. 'Oh my god!' said her friend. 'Get everything alive out of your house and seal it up. Now!'
  The lady was puzzled, but she did what her friend had told her. No sooner had she finished sealing all the doors and windows when the cactus exploded. Thousands and thousands of baby tarantulas came out and filled her whole house.
  Her cactus had had tarantula eggs in it!!!
  Example #3: As told by reader B.J. Hill...
  It seems that a family was given a gift of a gorgeous cactus. (Or perhaps they bought it — I don't know.) At any rate, they took it home and gave it a place of honor in the dining room.
  They soon noticed an interesting phenomenon — the cactus appeared to be 'breathing.' In-out, in-out, ever so slightly moved the sides of the huge plant. At first the family thought nothing of it, but then the father or mother or some other responsible soul decided to check it out with the local nursery.
  A telephone call was placed and the 'breathing' described. The nurseryman shrieked in horror, and told the father (mother, other responsible soul) to 'GET THE CACTUS OUT OF THE HOUSE, GET IT OUT NOW!' And Father (or whoever) dropped the phone and complied, racing to get the plant out into the yard.
  When he took it outside the cactus EXPLODED and hundreds (thousands, tens of thousands) of baby spiders erupted from the interior of the (now defunct) houseplant.
  Analysis: 'The Spider in the Yucca,' as this tale was known early on, first popped up in Scandinavia during the 1970s and migrated to other parts of the world, including the U.S., soon afterward. The southwestern decor fad breathed new life into the legend during the early '90s, when it also became fashionable to peg Ikea stores as purveyors of the infested houseplants.
  As to the veracity of the story, there's no reason to believe any such thing ever happened. According to an arachnid expert contacted by the Seattle Times , no spider or tarantula species are known to burrow into plants. Even if they did lay eggs inside a cactus (or any other) plant, the expert said, it wouldn't 'explode.'
  The story bears obvious similarities to ' The Fatal Hairdo ,' in which a vain young woman refuses to wash her hair for fear of messing up her towering beehive hairdo (or braids, or dreadlocks in other versions) and ends up with a nest of newly-hatched spiders on her head.
  Jan Harold Brunvand covered this urban legend extensively in his 1993 collection, The Baby Train .

  Also known as 'The Spider in the Hairdo' and 'The Deadly Hairdo'
  A very stylish teenage girl grew tired of spending hours carefully 'ratting' (teasing) and spraying her hair to attain an extreme beehive do. She washed her hair in sugar-water, allowing it to harden in the style she wanted. At night, she carefully wrapped a towel around it and slept on a special half-pillow designed not to disturb the hair.
  One morning she failed to come down for breakfast. Her mother went to her room only to find her dead in bed. When the towel was removed from her head, it was discovered that she had been gnawed to death by rats (or bugs — I've heard both versions).
  — As told by reader Jennifer Morrison
  My mother grew up in Ostersund, Sweden. When she was in her early teens, when beehive hairdos were popular, she was told about a girl in her school who wrapped her hair around bread dough to achieve maximum height to her beehive.
  After about three weeks of her winning hairdo she began to suffer severe headaches. She was finally taken to an emergency room, almost unconscious, where it was discovered that the dough, and consequently her scalp (really believable, that!), was totally infested with maggots.

  Please take caution. Pass this along to your friends and family. Must Read!
  Something terrible happened to a 10 yr. old girl who had braids. The little girl had been wearing her braids in a ponytail for the longest and apparently the braids were old, at least 2 to 3 months old, and the mother never took them down to wash them or let them air out or anything.
  Anyway, the girl had been complaining about having a headache for approximately two weeks to her mother who just brushed it off, assuming that she had hit her head against the wall or something. Well one morning the child again complained to her mother about having a headache while getting ready for school. Again the mother brushed her off. When the child got to school, she told her teacher that her head was hurting. The teacher assumed that the braids were too tight in the child's hair and attempted to let the ponytail down. When she removed the hair piece and let the braids loose, there was a spider in the childs hair.
  The spider had laid eggs in the childs hair and the spiders were eating her scalp. The child was rushed to the hospital were she later died.
  This happened in Monroe, La. It was all over the news and in the papers for about a week or two. Please, parents, don't leave braids, or any kind of hair extensions in childrens or your own hair no more than 2-3 weeks.

  Analysis: Can you think of anything creepier than a nest of spiders in your hair?
  Okay, maybe ants in your brain or a pus-filled tumor in your chicken sandwich give it a run for its money, but this urban legend about spider eggs hatching in a girl's unwashed hairdo is guaranteed to give you shivers.
  The most familiar versions of the creepy-crawly tale date from the early 1960s when 'beehive' hairdos were popular, but believe it or not there's at least one version dating back as far as the thirteenth century. In her 1976 paper, 'Three Medieval Tales and their Modern American Analogues' (reprinted in J.H. Brunvand's Readings in American Folklore , W.W. Norton: 1979), Shirley Marchalonis shares this ecclesiastical rendition:
  Marchalonis continues: 'The high school girl with the nest of spiders in her hair offends contemporary standards of behavior just as the proud medieval ladies offended contemporary belief. In both cases the story acts as warning and example.'
  That's the very definition of a cautionary tale .
  I should add that the forwarded email variant quoted above, which centers around a 10-year-old girl with unwashed braids, touches on another popular theme in contemporary folklore just now: parental neglect .

  This one was told to me by a former co-worker. And who knows — here in the south, home of fake tans and big hair, it might have happened!
  A young woman was approaching her wedding day. She decided that she'd look better in her wedding dress if she had a little color, so a week before the wedding she went to a tanning salon. The salon staff, however, told her that for her own safety, she could only tan for thirty minutes a day. After she'd tanned for her thirty minutes, she decided it wasn't enough, so she went to another tanning salon the same day to tan. They told her the same thing. She still wasn't tan enough after that thirty minutes, so she went to a third tanning salon, and a fourth.
  She did this for the next four days. Even though she was getting a little bit red, she kept thinking how good she'd look in her wedding dress.
  The day before her wedding she was found dead. Her internal organs had all burnt up from the tanning beds.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: This well-traveled story, delightfully retold by reader Kayla Pruett, inspired the title of Jan Harold Brunvand's third collection of urban legends , Curses, Broiled Again! There are many versions out there, but this is everyone's favorite — a bride-to-be who is so intent on looking fantastic at her wedding that she ignores every safety warning and cooks herself to death on a series of tanning beds.
  The moral here is the same as that of ' Spiders in the Hairdo ' — vanity kills. Interestingly, it's not enough in either story that the victim ultimately dies for her 'sins.' She must die a particularly gruesome, painful death! It's the horrific details, in part, that keep some of these old legends alive.
  We have no good reason to think that anything like what's described in this legend ever really happened. Quite the opposite. No one has ever had their internal organs 'cooked' or 'broiled' or 'burnt up' in a tanning booth. Why not? Because it's physically impossible. The ultraviolet rays emitted by these devices can seriously burn your skin if you overdo it — so don't — but unlike, say, a massive, prolonged dose of microwave radiation, they could not possibly cook you 'from the inside out.'

  Dear Urban Legends:
  I heard this one in 1996 when I was living up in Seattle. The teller seemed to think it was happening at that time in and around the Pugetopolis, but that seemed unlikely to me. However, if the story were told in the context of, say, Los Angeles (or even New York , Chicago, Detroit, etc.) it would actually seem sort of plausible. Anyway, here goes:
  The story is that a new gang initiation ritual has become prevalent in our city. The hoodlums pile in a car, at night, and drive the highways and byways with their lights off. The first person who 'flashes' them with their lights (in the time-honored gesture of 'hey, idiot, your lights are off!') becomes their prey. The gangbangers then pursue the samaritan and the initiate must gun him or her down without mercy.
  Sounds like a myth, right? But do you suppose there is a kernel of truth to the rumor; that perhaps somewhere at sometime some thugs did, in fact, use this modus operandi?

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Dear Reader:
  Apart from one or two copycat incidents which may have been inspired by this urban legend (not the other way around), I don't think so. This story has run rampant in virtually every major U.S. city since the early 1990s, sparking public panics and police investigations, but no one has ever documented an actual ' gang initiation ' incident matching this description in all that time.
  It is believed that one of the earliest outbreaks of the rumor (in 1993) may have been inspired by a real-life incident that occurred one year before -- the shooting of Stockton, California school secretary Kelly Freed, who was a passenger in an automobile whose driver gestured at a car full of teenagers to inform them that their headlights were off. Mistaking the hand signal as an insult, one of the teens fired a gun at the car Freed was riding in, killing her. Police determined that none of the youths were gang members, nor was the incident connected with an 'initiation rite.'
  On the Internet
  Email versions of what has come to be known as the 'Lights Out' legend began appearing in October 1998, perhaps inspired by the release of the popular horror film ' Urban Legend ,' in which the apocryphal gang-initiation tale figured prominently. The online alerts resulted in a fresh flurry of panicked inquiries to police departments in cities and towns throughout the U.S., many of which were already aware of the rumor by then but lacked the information to either substantiate or disprove it.
  In November of that year, John Moore, senior research associate at the National Youth Gang Center based in Tallahassee, stated that to the best of his knowledge the 'Lights Out' legend is completely false: 'I know of no incident in the country where this type of thing occurred,' he told a reporter for the Washington Post . 'This is one of the wonders of the Internet, that you can take something that has no basis in fact and make people believe it.'
  Nevertheless, probably because they fear the possibility of copycat outbreaks, some law enforcement agencies still recommend that motorists play it safe and refrain from flashing their headlights when driving in areas where gang activities are known to occur.
  Example #1: Email text contributed by Trevor M., Nov. 25, 1998:
  THIS IS NOT A JOKE
  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.
  The police officer that works with the DARE program at an elementary school passed this warning on.... If you're ever driving after dark and see an on-coming car with no headlights turned on, DO NOT flash your lights at them! This is a common gang member 'initiation game' that goes like this: the new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his 'target'. He is now required to turn around and chase that car and shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements. Make sure you share this info with all the drivers in your family!! Stay safe!!
  Example #2: Email text contributed by Ernest W., July 3, 2000:

  Please be advised if you are driving after dark and you see a car without headlights on DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS.... BLOW YOUR HORN... DO NOT SIGNAL THE CAR IN ANY WAY!!!
  This is a new GANG MEMBER initiation called 'GAME' going on in the street and it works like this: The new member being initiated drives along with their headlights off until someone notices and flashes their at him. The car that signals to the gang member is now the 'TARGET' of the game. The gang member is required to chase the car that signaled and SHOOT at, or into the car in order to complete initiation requirements.
  Police ask you to share this information with your family, friends and anyone else you come into contact with. This bulletin originally came from the 3rd district of Cleveland, Ohio Police Department. We understand it is beginning to happen in the Pittsburgh, PA area also and the warning is because this could escalate into any other geographic areas.

"The Mistletoe Bough","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/a/The-Mistletoe-Bough.htm","2015-12-22 04:38:49","  By David Emery
  'The Mistletoe Bough,' lyrics by Thomas Haynes Bayly , music by Sir Henry Bishop , is a ballad composed around 1830 retelling a traditional tale about a newlywed bride who accidentally locks herself in an old oak trunk while playing hide-and-seek with members of her wedding party, who then spend a long night searching for her in vain.
  Though the legend on which it was based had undoubtedly been circulating for quite some time before the lyrics were written, it's thought that the direct inspiration for Bayly's rendition was ' Ginevra ' from Samuel Rogers' Italy, a Poem , published in 1822. Also known by the titles 'The Mistletoe Bride,' 'The Missing Bride,' 'The Lost Bride,' and 'Bride-and-Seek,' versions of the age-old story are still told and sung today .
  THE MISTLETOE BOUGH
  The mistletoe hung in the castle hall, The holly branch shone on the old oak wall; And the baron's retainers were blithe and gay, And keeping their Christmas holiday. The baron beheld with a father's pride His beautiful child, young Lovell's bride; While she with her bright eyes seemed to be The star of the goodly company.

  Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  'I'm weary of dancing now,' she cried; 'Here, tarry a moment — I'll hide, I'll hide! And, Lovell, be sure thou'rt first to trace The clew to my secret lurking-place.' Away she ran — and her friends began Each tower to search, and each nook to scan; And young Lovell cried, 'O, where dost thou hide? I'm lonesome without thee, my own dear bride.' Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  They sought her that night, and they sought her next day, And they sought her in vain while a week passed away; In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot, Young Lovell sought wildly — but found her not. And years flew by, and their grief at last Was told as a sorrowful tale long past; And when Lovell appeared the children cried, 'See! the old man weeps for his fairy bride.' Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  At length an oak chest, that had long lain hid, Was found in the castle — they raised the lid, And a skeleton form lay mouldering there In the bridal wreath of that lady fair! O, sad was her fate! — in sportive jest She hid from her lord in the old oak chest. It closed with a spring! — and, dreadful doom, The bride lay clasped in her living tomb! Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.

  I first heard this story in 1980 in North Wales. I believed it until I was told it again a matter of days later. It is usually told as happening to a friend or relative.
  A young woman returns to her car from a day's shopping. She had parked her car in the town's multi-story car park.
  As she approaches the car she notices someone sitting in the back seat. She cautiously checks the registration plate to see if it is indeed her car, as it is a popular model and color. The car is indeed hers, and as she gets closer she sees that it's an old woman sitting in the back seat.
  She asks the woman how and why she is sitting in her car.
  The old woman replies that she had been shopping with her son and family but felt unwell and returned to the car to rest. She obviously had mistaken the young woman's car for her son's, as it was the same model and color. The old woman then asks to be driven to a hospital, as she is still feeling unwell. The young woman agrees.

  As she gets into the driver's seat something makes her very nervous about the situation and she asks the old woman if she is feeling well enough to direct her as she reverses the car out of the parking place. The old woman agrees, gets out of the car and proceeds to direct the reversing maneuver.
  As soon as the young woman has the car out of the parking space she speeds out of the car park, leaving the old woman stranded. She then drives straight to the nearest police station and reports the incident.
  A police officer then searched the car and found an axe concealed under the driver's seat.
  The young woman had had a lucky escape!
  Analysis: The tale of hairy-armed hitchhiker goes back to the early 1800s in England. In those days, the disguised axe murderer was said to have awaited his victim in the back seat of a horse-drawn carriage. More recently the legend has resurfaced with the malefactor posing as good samaritan whose briefcase just happens to be stuffed with deadly weapons.
  Two hundred years old and still going strong, proof that a great story never dies.

"Psychic Predicts Halloween Campus Massacre","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/campus_massacre.htm","2016-01-17 21:31:45","  On October 13, 2007 the Kent, Ohio Record-Courier reported that Kent State University was rife with rumors alleging that famous psychic Sylvia Browne had appeared on the Montel Williams Show and predicted a mass murder would take place on the campus Halloween night. University administrators investigated, the report continued, and concluded the story was an 'urban legend.'
  Rewind to October 28, 1998....
  
  THERE WAS no mistaking the urgency of the message that appeared in my inbox on the 21st of October. The subject header read: 'Mass Murder at MSU.' The message said:
  As a matter of fact I had heard the same rumor not a week before. Pat Grauer, an About.com colleague who also happened to be the public relations director for the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Michigan State, had written to apprise me of the urban-legendish rumor because her office was receiving quite a few inquiries about it — 'besieged' was actually the word she used — and could I shed any light on the situation?
  'It is reported,' she wrote, 'that last Monday or Tuesday on Oprah there was a guest who predicted (items in parentheses vary with teller):
  'I called university administration,' Pat went on to say. 'They've gotten a number of worried calls, from parents no less! I called Oprah's staff, and they said they've been 'swamped' with queries all week, and that NOTHING like that was said on the show.
  'The building in which I'm sitting at the moment fits the rumor to a 'T,'' she said.
  'People are scared.'
  'Wow, you've got a problem'
  Neither I nor Pat knew it at the time, but the same rumor was spreading simultaneously at the University of Dayton and would soon erupt at the University of Michigan and other campuses, as well.
  'Wow, you've got a problem,' I wrote back to Pat. 'I hadn't heard a word about this rumor until you contacted me. I've looked around to see if there's a buzz on the Internet and couldn't find anything there, either.'
  In my ignorance, I was treating the rumor as an isolated phenomenon. True, it had a familiar ring, but I failed to recognize it as a known urban legend — a gap in my education soon to be filled with Pat Grauer's help. She wrote the next day:
  'There was great reassurance at http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/campus.asp , which basically detailed the whole rumor as early as April 1997.'
  As early as 1997? So it was an urban legend! The URL pointed to the Urban Legends Reference Pages (Snopes.com), where every bogus story meets its match in David and Barbara Mikkelson, the Nick and Nora Charles of urban legendry. Unsurprisingly, they'd already sniffed out the goods on this one. From their article, 'Campus Halloween Murders':
  It was back to the library for me.
  Meanwhile, back at Michigan State
  'URBAN LEGEND STRIKES ‘U',' blared the front page of the State News of MSU on October 16. 'STUDENTS NEED NOT FEAR A HALLOWEEN MASSACRE THIS YEAR.' (Or any year, one would hope. )
  The article was full of reassuring words from University officials. A publicist for Oprah Winfrey stated that no such prediction had been made on her show. This was enough to soothe the frayed nerves of some students, but not all.
  'I'm scared,' freshman Adam Panter told the News . 'I’m going to the fraternity house for the weekend. I don’t care if it is true or not. I’m not waiting around to find out.'
  Panter resides in Holden Hall, an H-shaped building which also happens to be near some railroad tracks — a triple-whammy, if the rampant rumors are to be believed. State News staff writer Jennifer Meese summarized them thus:
  Little Bo Peep???
  Little Bo Peep, a knife-wielding maniac in pigtails
  In The Baby Train (W.W. Norton, 1993), folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand writes that among many other outbreaks over the past 20 years, four university campuses in the South and Midwest of the United States were hit by rumors very similar to the one that had cropped up at MSU. Certain details rung especially familiar:
  It was also rumored that the building would be U-shaped and located near a graveyard.
  At Ohio Northern University the Bo Peep motif was repeated, with the additional provisions that the ill-fated campus would have a name beginning with 'O' and be surrounded by 'very, very flat landscape.'
  The rumor at Purdue was that the killings would take place in an X-shaped building on either the highest or lowest spot on campus.
  And so on.
  'Nothing but a grisly rumor'
  The more I read, the clearer it became that outbreaks of the urban legend on U.S. college campuses around Halloween occur so regularly and in such similar detail that it has virtually become a tradition. The same whispered scenario circulates year after year after year... yet no one at any of these colleges has ever been slaughtered on Halloween night. The panic it causes is sometimes quite real, sad to say, but there's no adequate solution to the problem. I mean, banning Little Bo Peep costumes at Halloween parties — as was done on a couple of campuses in 1988 — may seem like a 'preventative measure' to some, but come on! This is just an urban legend — in Brunvand's words, 'nothing but a grisly rumor.'
  When I responded to the MSU student who contacted me, I said these things. I tried my best to reassure him that there's nothing to be afraid of. I wondered if more frightened students might contact me, but none did.
  Pat Grauer wrote again on the 26th to say that the rumor seemed to be 'diffusing' a bit on the MSU campus, but that local high school students were now picking it up and passing it around.
  Ah, well. At that point there were only five more days to go until Halloween, after which, thankfully, the crisis would be past for another year.
  Then, yesterday, a rather familiar-sounding message came in over the transom. It began:
  'I am doing a story on Urban Legends because the mass-murder-on-a-college-campus-type story is going around here at the University of Michigan...'
  It's going to be a looooong five days.

"Humans Can Lick, Too","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/humans_can_lick.htm","2016-01-30 16:45:38","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Licked Hand,' 'The Dog's Lick,' 'People Can Lick, Too,' 'Not Only Dogs Can Lick,' etc.
  Example #1 As told by U.K. reader Kirsty H....
  Once there was a nice old lady who had a lovely little dog. One day, the old lady heard on the radio that a crazy murderer had escaped from jail and that she should lock all her doors and windows. So she locked every door and window in the house except one tiny one to let some air in. She thought that a murderer would never get in through there.
  So that night she went to bed as usual. She knew everything was okay because when she put down her hand the dog licked it. But later in the night she heard a drip , drip , drip . She put her hand down and the dog licked it and everything was okay, so she went downstairs to check out the tap. But the tap wasn't dripping. So she went to bed again. And everything was okay. She woke up again later in the night, though, so she thought the dripping sound must be coming from the shower. She went into the bathroom, and there was her dog, dead, hanging in the shower, dripping with blood, all its intestines hanging out.

  Written on the mirror was: 'Humans can lick, too!' And behind her in the mirror, she saw the murderer.
  Example #2 Viral text circulating online as of May 2001...
  Subj: DON'T DELETE THIS!!! (it scared the crap outta me) Once there was a a beautiful young girl who lived in a small town just south of Farmersburg. Her parents had to go to town for a while, so they left their daughter home alone, but protected by her dog, which was a very large collie. The parents told the girl to lock all the windows and doors after they had left. And at about 8:00pm the parents went to town. So doing what she was told the girl shut and locked every window and every door. But there was one window in the basement that would not close completely. Trying as best as she could she finally got the window shut, but it would not lock. So she left the window, and went back upstairs. But just to make sure that no one could get in, she put the dead-bolt lock on the basement door. Then she sat down had some dinner and decided to go to sleep for the night. Settling down to sleep at about 12:00 she snuggled up with the dog and fell asleep. But at one point, she suddenly woke up. She turned and looked at the clock...it was 2:30. She snuggled down again wondering what had woken her.....when she heard a noise. It was a dripping sound. She thought that she had left the water running, and now it was dripping into the drain of her sink. So thinking it was no big deal she decided to go back to sleep. But she felt nervous so she reached her hand over the edge of her bed, and let the dog lick her hand for reassurance that he would protect her. Again at about 3:45 she woke up hearing dripping. She was slightly angry now but went back to sleep anyway. Again she reached down and let the dog lick her hand. Then she fell back to sleep. At 6:52 the girl decided that she had had enough...she got up just in time to see her parents were pulling up to the house. 'Good,'she thought. 'Now somebody can fix the sink...'cause I know I didn't leave it running.' She walked to the bathroom and there was the collie dog, skinned and hung up on the curtain rod. The noise she heard was its blood dripping into a puddle on the floor. The girl screamed and ran to her bedroom to get a weapon, in case someone was still in the house.....and there on the floor, next to her bed she saw a small note, written in blood, saying: HUMANS CAN LICK TOO, MY BEAUTIFUL. Now it is time for you to lock all the windows and doors. This letter is the only chain letter that is true. This did happen many years ago, and the man who killed the dog was never caught. If you delete this letter you will suffer the same fate as the girl in the story did, years after the dog was killed. She was raped and killed in the same town and same house as the dog. Do not dismiss this letter, because if you do, a horrible thing will become of you, everyone will soon know your name. But only because it will be the headline of your local newspaper for a long time. It will read... Small Town Murder On The Loose! You can not chance your luck on a chain letter so serious as this. Give up your chance to send this letter to 23 people and you will be giving up your chance to live. You were warned. I hope that I will not see any murder stories in the papers anytime soon. And now I bid you a good day. And one more thing... you only have 23 minutes... sorry.
  Analysis: 'Humans Can Lick, Too' is another handwriting-on-the-wall tale in the same vein as ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? ' and ' Welcome to the World of AIDS .'
  The trope derives from a Bible story (book of Daniel) in which a feast thrown by the pagan Babylonian King Belshazzar is interrupted by the specter of a disembodied hand scrawling a cryptic message on the wall. As ultimately interpreted by the prophet Daniel, the message conveys God's judgment, predicting the downfall of Belshazzar and his entire kingdom. To 'read the handwriting on the wall' is to foresee one's own impending doom — an apt and chilling metaphor.
  Note that the chain letter format (second variant above) does little to enhance the impact of the story; in point of fact, the directive to 'pass this along or die' undermines the narrative by transporting it to some fantasy realm where murderous madmen are capable of stalking their victims via forwarded email. That aside, the email retelling follows a tried-and-true formula, and works.
  Variants of 'Humans Can Lick, Too' were being collected by folklorists as long ago as the late 1960s. Indeed, the chain-letter version appears to have been cribbed from a 1967 oral transcription published in Ronald L. Baker's Hoosier Folk Legends (Indiana University Press, 1982). As in the later variant, the events were said to have taken place near a small town called Farmersburg, though there were two female protagonists instead of one, and the note left by the murdering madman read as follows:
  'I'm coming to see you. I had my chance once before, but I didn't take it. Not only dogs can lick.'
  This is the very definition of a cautionary tale .

"The Hook","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the_hook.htm","2016-05-30 23:50:03","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Hook Man'
  A teenage boy drove his date to a dark and deserted lovers' lane for a make-out session. He turned on the radio for mood music, leaned over to whisper in the girl's ear, and began kissing her.
  Minutes later, the mood was broken when the music suddenly stopped mid-song. After a moment of silence an announcer's voice came on, warning in an ominous tone that a convicted murderer had just escaped from the state insane asylum — which happened to be located within a half-mile of where they were parked — and urging that anyone who notices a man wearing a stainless steel hook in place of his missing right hand should immediately report his whereabouts to the police.
  The girl became frightened and asked to be taken home. The boy, feeling bold, locked all the doors instead and, assuring his date they would be safe, attempted to kiss her again. She became frantic and pushed him away, insisting that they leave. Relenting, the boy peevishly jerked the car into gear and spun its wheels as he pulled out of the parking space.

  When they arrived at the girl's house she got out of the car, and, reaching to close the door, began to scream uncontrollably. The boy ran to her side to see what was wrong and there, dangling from the door handle, was a bloody hook.
  Analysis: Folks have been telling the hook-man story since the 1950s, and indeed the implicit moral message — 'Sex is naughty; bad boys and girls will be punished!' — seems more appropriate to that simpler, more naive era. Just as this message has come to be parodied in recent horror films (whereas, once upon a time, it was delivered with morbid solemnity), its 'bygone' relevance has taken the teeth out of the cautionary tale .
  Remarking on the improbable tidiness of the plot of 'The Hook,' folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand observed that 'most tellers narrate the story nowadays more as a scary story than a believed legend.' Small wonder. Given its exploitation by Hollywood in popular genre films like Candyman and I Know What You Did Last Summer , most people under the age of 30 probably assume the story was invented by screenwriters.
  Folklorists of a more Freudian bent find meaningful sexual overtones in the imagery of the tale. The boy, who wants to get his 'hooks' into the girl, is not only frustrated by her unwillingness but afraid of his own lustful impulses — a fear heightened by the stern 'voice of conscience' emitting from the radio — and has to 'pull out fast' before a deadly sin is committed. The tearing off of the madman's hook symbolizes castration. Proponents of this type of psychological interpretation find the sexual apprehensions of both boys and girls represented in the legend.
  One of the earliest appearances of 'The Hook' in print was in a 'Dear Abby' column dated Nov. 8, 1960:
  DEAR ABBY: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me:
  A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite 'lovers' lane' to listen to the radio and do a little necking. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple became frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the car door for her. Then he saw — a hook on the door handle! I don't think I will ever park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids.
  Not all urban legends in this vein have a safe and happy ending, I should point out. See ' The Boyfriend's Death ' for an example of a similar cautionary tale that pulls no punches. If you dare...

"Are John Dillinger's Private Parts on Display at the Smithsonian?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/john_dillinger.htm","2015-08-21 14:32:13","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  You are no doubt tired of hearing this, so I will be brief and not waste much of your time. I believe I read an article by Robert Anton Wilson a ways back regarding the Smithsonian or some D.C. museum housing private parts of famous people — John Dillinger, for example. Is there any truth to this folklore?
  Dear Reader:
  No truth that I could uncover. Moreover, the very idea that so august and respectable an edifice as the Smithsonian Institution would house an exhibit of celebrity genitalia rings absurd. They've denied it time and time again.
  'In response to your recent inquiry,' begins a statement from the management of the Smithsonian quoted in Dillinger: The Untold Story (Indiana University Press, 2005), 'we can assure you that anatomical specimens of John Dillinger are not, and have never been, in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution.'
  A spokesperson queried by the New York Times in 1994 put it even more bluntly: 'We have no penises.'

  There seems little room for doubt.
  What about Walter Reed Army Medical Center?
  There's another well-known museum in Washington, D.C., the National Museum of Health & Medicine at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, whose exhibits do boast both celebrity body parts and diseased/abnormal sexual organs. But though it is home to such fascinating oddments as President Eisenhower's gall bladder and John Wilkes Booth's vertebrae, you won't find private parts of famous people anywhere on the premises, I'm told. Specifically, according to the Museum's online FAQ , you won't find the private parts of Prohibition-era gangster John Dillinger:
  The mystery of the posthumous pelvic bulge
  Despite decades of denials, the Smithsonian Institution alone receives over a hundred requests per year for viewings of the purportedly pickled penis, says a report in Maxim magazine.
  There must be a reason for all this prurient interest, and as it turns out one needn't search far to find it. For several years running one of the most popular entries on the now-defunct World Sexual Records website was this question: 'Is it true that John Dillinger had a 20-inch penis?' It's a line of inquiry that goes back at least half a century, I discovered, suggesting that the size of Dillinger's organ has long been an urban legend unto itself.
  It all started, apparently, with the photograph mentioned above showing Dillinger's draped cadaver shortly after he was gunned down by FBI agents in 1934. In it, there appears to be an abnormally large, er, protrusion in the pelvic region — so large a protrusion, in fact (the height of which has been estimated at anywhere from 13 to 28 inches), that one of the pathologists in attendance felt compelled to remove the anomalous appendage and preserve it for posterity.
  Or so the story goes.
  Skeptics have objected all along
  Skeptics have objected all along that the disproportionate protuberance — which isn't even visible in other photographs of the cadaver — could be explained by factors as mundane as a raised knee under the sheet or the placement of the cadaver's arm, etc. It's even conceivable that the entire tableau was staged as someone's idea of a joke. For what it's worth, the official autopsy report makes no mention of a detached or missing penis — in fact, it makes no mention of Dillinger's private parts at all.
  None of which is to say that someone with privileged access to the corpse couldn't have made off with the precious organ between the autopsy and burial and preserved it in formaldehyde; stranger things have happened. There's no shortage of people who claim to have seen it. For that matter, a con artist could have passed off the pickled privates of an imposter as Dillinger's at some point in time, unintentionally giving rise to this very urban legend .
  It isn't too far a stretch to imagine John Dillinger's Penis as a lucrative sideshow attraction back in the day . . . right next to the jar containing Adolf Hitler's Brain.

  A CHARLOTTE, North Carolina man, having purchased a case of rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against (get this) fire! Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company.
  In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars 'in a series of small fires.' The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued — and won! In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that the cigars would be insured against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire, it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.
  Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company grudgingly accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in the fires. After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one-year terms.
  So don't piss off your insurance company!

  Subject: A well-planned retirement
  From The London Times:
  Outside the Bristol Zoo, in England, there is a parking lot for 150 cars and 8 coaches, or buses. It was manned by a very pleasant attendant with a ticket machine charging cars 1 pound (about $1.40) and coaches 5 (about $7). This parking attendant worked there solid for all of 25 years. Then, one day, he just didn't turn up for work.
  'Oh well', said Bristol Zoo Management, 'we'd better phone up the City Council and get them to send a new parking attendant...'
  'Er... no', said the Council, 'that parking lot is your responsibility.'
  'Er... no', said Bristol Zoo management, 'the attendant was employed by the City Council, wasn't he?'
  'Er... NO!' insisted the Council.
  Sitting in his villa somewhere on the coast of Spain, is a bloke who had been taking the parking lot fees, estimated at 400 pounds (about $560) per day at Bristol Zoo for the last 25 years. Assuming 7 days a week, this amounts to just over 3.6 million pounds ($7 million).
  And no one even knows his name.

  JUST WHEN you lost faith in human kindness. . .
  Someone who teaches at a Middle School in Safety Harbor, Florida forwarded the following letter. The letter was sent to the principal's office after the school had sponsored a luncheon for the elderly. An old lady received a new radio at the lunch, and was writing to say thanks:
  God blesses you for the beautiful radio I won at your recent senior citizens luncheon. I am 84 years old and live at the Safety Harbor Assisted Home for the Aged. All of my family has passed away. I am all alone now and it's nice to know that someone is thinking of me. God bless you for your kindness to an old forgotten lady.
  My roommate is 95 and always had her own radio, but before I received one, she would never let me listen to hers, even when she was napping. The other day her radio fell off the night stand and broke into a lot of pieces. It was awful and she was in tears. She asked if she could listen to mine, and I said, 'Fuck you.'
  Life is good.

  THESE TWO guys my friend knows work for Chase Bank. Every year they go to Australia for a big, bank-sponsored golf tournament. This past year, these guys and their team won the entire tournament and went on to drink lots of beers and celebrate while wearing their newly-won green tournament jackets.
  After drinking up a storm, they plopped into their rented car and were driving on deserted roads nearby when they accidentally hit a large kangaroo.
  Getting out of the car, they realized that the kangaroo had died in the accident.
  Being so drunk, though, they propped up the kangaroo, its lifeless head bouncing from one side to the other, dressed it in one of their new green jackets, and took pictures of themselves with their arms around it.
  After a few minutes of picture-taking, the guys were shocked when it seemed that the kangaroo came back to life! It turns out that the poor kangaroo wasn't dead, but it had passed out, and when it came back to consciousness started to box with the drunken guys! It actually broke one guy's jaw!! It then hopped away into the landscape.
  The men couldn't drive their rented car, as the keys were in the green jacket, which was still on the kangaroo, so they had to walk back to the tournament. A little while later, a pack of kangaroos was seen in the distance, one of them wearing the green jacket.

  A YOUNG lady has a new, well-to-do boyfriend. He suggests that she come and meet his parents by having dinner at their place. After a pleasant drive into the country he pulls into a long, impressive drive and she is shocked to find that 'their place' is a huge country estate. The door is opened by a butler, who shows the couple in. It's a very impressive, stately home with history, etc.
  Everything goes well as they are given drinks and introduced.
  Being a normal, working class girl, she is a bit awestruck and worried about making a faux pas or breaking some rule of etiquette she is unaware of.
  After several drinks she relaxes and they are shown into the dining room for a large feast. Halfway through dinner, the girl, having drunk a fair bit, needs the loo. In her best, polite manner she asks for 'the bathroom?' and is shown out of the room by a servant and pointed upstairs to a room.
  It's a huge house with many rooms and she finds what she thinks is the right door, only to find a 'bathroom' — i.e., no toilet, just a sink and bath. As she only needs a quick wee, she locks the door, hitches up her skirt and, balancing one leg on the bath, sits on the pedestal sink. Unfortunately, it starts to tip over and she hits her head on the bath and knocked unconscious.
  She is awakened by a commotion as the door is pushed in and her new boyfriend and family burst in to see her, knickers down, skirt raised and soaking wet, with the broken sink on the floor and water pouring everywhere!!!

  THERE WAS a sweet older lady who would often do grocery shopping for the infirm and elderly in her church. One hot, summer day a lady asked her to pick up a few things and bring them by her house in a dangerous part of Baltimore City. The sweet old lady was wary but felt that she couldn't say no, even though she was terrified of driving in the part of the city that often had shoot-outs and other drug violence.
  Anyway, the woman went on her way, picked up the groceries and proceeded to the lady's house.
  As she entered the lady's neighborhood she noticed young hoodlums gathering on every street corner. Although she had no air conditioning in the car, she rolled the windows up tightly (as a safety precaution) and suffered in the 90+ degree heat.
  She drove ahead until suddenly she heard a loud 'POP!' and felt a jolt to the back of her head. She reached to feel the back of her head and came back with a wet oozing mess that she was sure was part of her brain! Knowing that she had been shot, the woman turned around and raced to a local hospital.
  Somehow she made it to the emergency room and had the strength to walk right in. She told the attendant that she had been shot. Immediately she was rushed back to an exam room. Doctors whirled around and asked where she had been shot (since they saw no blood). She said 'my head,' and the doctors found a mass of the oozing white substance the woman had first noticed.
  Upon inspection the doctors realized that the white substance wasn't part of her brain but was instead a lump of biscuit dough (the kind in a can) that had exploded from the heat of her car!

  This is just too funny not to share. Excerpted from an article which appeared in the Dublin Times about a bank robbery on March 2, 1999.
  Once inside the bank shortly after midnight, their efforts at disabling the internal security system got underway immediately.
  The robbers, who expected to find one or two large safes filled with cash and valuables, were surprised to see hundreds of smaller safes scattered throughout the bank.
  The robbers cracked the first safe's combination, and inside they found only a bowl of vanilla pudding.
  As recorded on the bank's audio tape system, one robber said, 'At least we'll have a bit to eat.' The robbers opened up a second safe, and it also contained nothing but vanilla pudding. The process continued until all the safes were opened.
  They found not one pound sterling, a diamond, or an ounce of gold. Instead, all the safes contained covered bowls of pudding.
  Disappointed, the robbers made a quiet exit, each leaving with nothing more than a queasy, uncomfortably full stomach.
  The newspaper headline read:
  'IRELAND'S LARGEST SPERM BANK ROBBED EARLY THIS MORNING.'

  ONE YEAR at Thanksgiving, my mom went to my sister's house for the traditional feast. Knowing how gullible my sister is, my mom decided to play a trick. She told my sister that she needed something from the store. When my sister left, my mom took the turkey out of the oven. She removed the stuffing, stuffed a Cornish hen, inserted it into the turkey, and re-stuffed the turkey. She then placed the bird(s) back in the oven.
  When it was time for dinner, my sister pulled the turkey out of the oven and proceeded to remove the stuffing. When her serving spoon hit something, she reached in and pulled out the little bird.
  With a look of total shock on her face, my mother exclaimed, 'Patricia, You've cooked a pregnant bird!'
  At the reality of this horrifying news, my sister started to cry. It took the family two hours to convince her that turkeys lay eggs!
  Yep, you got it....
  SHE'S BLONDE!

  A HAPPY, hip, happening woman living in San Francisco has to endure a visit from her mother, a prim and proper matronly sort from somewhere in the Midwest. The mother is in the throes of menopause, apparently very cranky and physically uncomfortable, what with hot flashes and the like, and the daughter, in an effort to help but probably also to get Mom out of the house for awhile, suggests that the mother visit her gynecologist.
  Mom is not fond of the idea of visiting a gynecologist in a strange city. But after the daughter assures her that the man is thoughtful, kind, humorous and sweet and implores her to go just to make sure everything is okay, the mother reluctantly assents and makes an appointment.
  The morning of the appointment, mother is VERY nervous and in preparation takes a shower AND a bath, deodorant head to toe, FDS vaginal spray, the whole nine yards, and heads to the gynecologist.
  So. Mom's in the stirrups, the doctor's mucking about down there, and he looks up, fixes her with a funny smile and says, 'Looks like we've got ourselves a PARTY GIRL!!'
  Mother is shocked, to say the least. 'What... what did you say??!!!'
  He grins even wider. 'I said, 'Looks like we've got ourselves a PARTY GIRL!'' and this is accompanied by a smirk and a wink. Mom is flabbergasted and doesn't utter another word for the balance of the exam, hastily dresses and runs out while avoiding his glance.
  Later that evening, the daughter returns home from work, inquires how the appointment went, and the mother says, 'You have a very rude doctor!
  He called me a party girl!'
  'A what?'
  'A party girl!' Mom is sniffling now. 'Why would he call me that?'
  'I don't know, it's very out of character for him...' the daughter puzzles. 'There must be some reason. Think back. Did you say anything, maybe?'
  'No!' The mother bristles. 'I didn't say anything like that!'
  'Come on, think back. What did you do before the appointment?'
  'Well,' the mother sniffs, 'I was VERY conscientious with my hygiene. I took a bath AND a shower, I used your deodorant and FDS — I hope you don't mind — and then I got dressed, and...'
  'Mom!' the daughter interrupts. 'Mom, I don't have any FDS.'
  The mother is silent. They both head to the bathroom where the mother points out what she mistook for FDS. It wasn't. It was orange glitter hair spray from the previous Halloween.
  The moral being: READ THE LABEL!

  FOR ANYONE who feels they've been invited to too many weddings lately, have a laugh. This is actually true. It was in a local newspaper in South Carolina and even Jay Leno mentioned it on The Tonight Show .
  This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.
  After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd.
  He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming, and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.
  To thank everyone for coming, bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So, taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.
  He said that this was his gift and told everyone to open their envelopes.
  Inside each envelope was an 8x10 photo of his best man having sex... with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding.
  After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, 'F--- you!' He turned to his bride and said, 'F--- you!' Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, 'I'm out of here!'
  He had the marriage annulled the first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway, as if nothing was wrong.
  His revenge:
  1) Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guests for a wedding and reception.
  2) Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And, best of all...
  3) Trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends and their entire families.
  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might see one of those MasterCard 'Priceless' commercials out of this? Huh?
  Elegant wedding for 300 family and guests — $32,000 Photographers for the wedding — $3,000 Deluxe Honeymoon accommodations in Maui for 2 weeks — $8,500 The look on everyone's faces after seeing a photo of the Bride and Best Man having sex — PRICELESS!!!

  AT HEATHROW Airport in England, a 300-foot red carpet was stretched out to Air Force One and President Bush strode to a warm but dignified handshake from Queen Elizabeth II. They rode in a silver 1934 Bentley to the edge of central London where they boarded an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificent white horses.
  As they rode toward Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side and waving to the thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all was going well.
  This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry and dignity. Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip the most horrendous, earth-shattering, eye-smarting blast of flatulence, and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes.
  Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that was a ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassing situation. She turned to Mr. Bush and explained, 'Mr. President, please accept my regrets. I'm sure you understand that there are some things even a Queen cannot control.'
  George W., ever the Texas gentleman, replied, 'Your Majesty, please don't give the matter another thought. You know, if you hadn't said something I would have assumed it was one of the horses.'

  THIS IS a bricklayer's accident report, which was printed in the newsletter of the British equivalent of the Workers' Compensation  Board.  This is a true story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure.
  Dear Sir:
  I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put 'Poor planning' as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.
  I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later, were found to be slightly in excess of 500 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.
  Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs.
  Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.  Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed.
  This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form.
  Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.  At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel.  Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight.
  As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.  This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body.  Here my luck began to change slightly.  The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks, and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.
  I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.  This explains the two broken legs.
  I hope this answers your inquiry.

  WHEN APOLLO Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' statement but followed it by several remarks, usual com traffic between him, the other astronauts, and Mission Control. Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark, 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.'
  Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut.
  However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky' statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.
  On July 5, 1995 (in Tampa Bay, FL), while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.
  When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. & Mrs. Gorsky.
  As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, 'Oral sex! You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!'

  A MAN was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered.
  The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband.
  After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet. The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home.
  After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin.
  The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance.
  The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his arm. Now THAT is a bad day...

  A MARRIED couple were invited to a swanky masked Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.
  The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party.
  In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.
  His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little bang.
  Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.
  She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had had. He said, 'Oh the same old thing.
  You know I never have a good time when you're not there.'
  Then she asked, 'Did you dance much?'
  He replied, 'I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... The guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good time!'

  THIS STORY happened a while ago in Dublin, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, it’s true.
  John Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm.
  The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped.
  John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... Only to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn’t on. The car started moving slowly. John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window, and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him.
  Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just had.
  A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying... And wasn’t drunk.
  Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath.
  Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other...
  Look, Paddy... there’s that idiot that got in the car while we were pushing it!

  FROM THE Sydney Morning Herald comes this story of a central west couple who  drove their car into K-Mart only to have their car break down in the car park. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.
  The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis.
  Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned his private parts into glaringly public ones.
  Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.
  On regaining her feet she looked across the bonnet and found herself staring at her husband standing idly by.
  The mechanic however had to have three stitches in his head.

"The Kidney Thieves","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/kidney_thieves.htm","2017-01-06 16:49:09","  By David Emery
  No one knows why, but in 1997 a mind contagion broke out in New Orleans. As the city geared up for its annual Mardi Gras festivities in January, a rumor began spreading via word-of-mouth, fax, and forwarded email to the effect that a highly organized crime ring in New Orleans was carrying out plans to drug visiting tourists, surgically remove healthy kidneys from their bodies, and sell the organs on the black market.
  The viral message , which most often arrived under the header 'Travelers Beware,' sparked an avalanche of phone calls to local authorities, prompting the New Orleans Police Department to publish an official statement to calm public fears. Investigators found no substantiating evidence.
  The story had a familiar ring. Before New Orleans, people said it happened in Houston; before Houston, Las Vegas — where an unsuspecting tourist was drugged in his hotel room by a prostitute and woke up the next morning, supposedly, in a bathtub full of ice, minus a kidney.

  It's a scenario that has taken many forms. You may have heard it from a friend who'd heard it from another friend, whose mother swore it had happened to a distant cousin.
  In one version, the victim — we'll call him 'Bob' — was on a business trip alone somewhere in Europe, and went out to a bar one night to have a cocktail. Wouldn't you know it, he woke up the next morning in an unfamiliar hotel room with severe pain in his lower back. He was taken to the emergency room, where doctors determined that, unbeknownst to himself, Bob had undergone major surgery the night before. One of his kidneys had been removed, cleanly and professionally.
  A chilling tale, and a dubious one. With minor variations, the same story has been told thousands of times by thousands of different people in many different locales. And it's always based on third-, fourth-, or fifth-hand information. It's an urban legend .
  The case for the existence of an international black market organ trade has become increasingly convincing in recent years. What remains unsubstantiated are the tales of 'back room' organ thefts perpetrated in the dark of night in seedy hotel rooms or secluded alleyways.
  'There is absolutely no evidence of such activity ever occurring in the U.S. or any other industrialized country,' says the United Network for Organ Sharing. 'While the tale sounds credible enough to some listeners, it has no basis in the reality of organ transplantation.'
  In fact, it's all but impossible for such activities to take place outside properly-equipped medical facilities, UNOS argues. The removal, transport, and transplantation of human organs involves procedures so complex and delicate, requiring a sterile setting, minute timing, and the support of so many highly-trained personnel, that they simply could not be accomplished on the street.
  The National Kidney Foundation has repeatedly issued requests for alleged victims of such crimes to come forward and validate their stories. To date, none have.
  Even so, like so many urban legends fueled by irrational fear and ignorance, the organ theft story continues to spread from person to person and place to place, changing and adapting to its surroundings over time like a mutating virus.
  Unlike many other urban legends , unfortunately, this one has put real people's lives at risk. A decade or so ago, rumors began spreading in Guatemala to the effect that Americans were kidnapping local children in order to harvest their organs for transplantation in the United States. In 1994, several U.S. citizens and Europeans were attacked by mobs who believed the rumors to be true. An American woman, Jane Weinstock, was severely beaten and remains critically impaired.
  Closer to home, charitable organizations dedicated to facilitating and funding organ transplants are concerned that tales of black marketeering may be at least partially responsible for a reduction in the ranks of volunteer donors, resulting in needless deaths among seriously ill patients awaiting transplants.
  Contagion is an apt metaphor here. Tracing the spread of this pernicious rumor and the fear that it engenders, we see that acts as a sort of mind-virus, adapting to new environments as it jumps from host to host — even reaching epidemic proportions when conditions are right.
  This way of looking at the propagation of urban legends comes from the discipline of memetics, which investigates the properties of 'memes,' or 'units of cultural transmission.' Other examples of memes are songs, ideas, fashions, and commercial slogans. Think of cultures as 'meme pools' — comparable to the 'gene pools' discussed in biological evolution — and think of memes as informational entities that replicate and evolve in order to survive.
  One thing the longevity of the kidney theft tale makes clear is that a meme need not be true to be fit for survival. What it must — and in this case, certainly does — have are traits that consistently induce one host to communicate the meme to another.
  One such trait is its ability, like a good ghost story, to spark a visceral tingle of fear in the listener. This is probably, in fact, among the strongest characteristics a meme can have; for fear induces stress and one way we as human beings attempt to cope with stress is by distributing it among our peers. On the darker side, there is undeniably a sensation of power to be had by successfully provoking fear in others. Some people actually take a perverse pleasure in it.
  Someone, we don't know who, initiated the cavalcade of faxes, emails and phone calls in early 1997 that caused panic among prospective travelers to New Orleans. It's hard to imagine what the rumormonger's motivation was, if not to share a feeling of panic. In succeeding, he or she induced others to do the same. An epidemic was born.
  The best remedy is accurate information. But remember, viruses adapt in order to survive, and this one has proven to be especially flexible and resilient. We can expect a new strain to show up in due time, in a brand-new environment in which it can flourish and with some compelling new twist to keep it fresh. We can't predict where it will happen, nor can we do much to prevent it. The best we can do, we 'epidemiologists of culture,' is watch and learn, and share what we know. The rest is up to the vagaries of human nature, and the natural selection of memes.

"The Killer in the Backseat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/killer_backseat.htm","2015-09-18 14:38:30","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Emily Dunbar:
  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911 !'

  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.
  The moral of the story: Always check the back seat!
  Analysis: In another common variant of this legend, the imperiled female (and it's always a female, please note) pulls into a gas station and is frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who keeps trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. It turns out he has glimpsed a knife-wielding murderer in the backseat and is trying to save her life!
  Folklorists have traced the legend back to the 1960s and believe it may have been inspired by a vaguely similar real event in 1964 involving the discovery by a New York City policeman of an escaped murderer hiding in the backseat of his (the cop's) own car.
  'The Killer in the Backseat' was among the legendary horror stories dramatized in the 1998 film Urban Legend . Let us not assume, however, that real-life evildoers never lie in wait for their victims in the backseats of vehicles. As reported in the Decatur Daily News on September 14, 2007, a female college student in Alabama was threatened by a man with a gun who popped up suddenly in the backseat of her SUV. She escaped, fortunately, by slamming on the brakes and bolting from the car.

  In which we are asked to believe that NASA scientists inadvertently proved that the biblical account of God causing the sun to stand still for a day actually happened as described.
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: 1960s Status: False (details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by R. Dean, Nov. 12, 1998:
  Did you know that the space program is busy proving that what has been called 'myth' in the Bible is true? Mr Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore Maryland and a consultant in the space program, relates the following development.
  I think one of the most amazing things that God has for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Green Belt, Maryland. They were checking the position of the sun, moon, and planets out in space where they would be 100 years and 1000 years from now.
  We have to know this so we won't send a satellite, up and have it bump into something later on its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite, and where the planets will be so the whole thing will not bog down. They ran the computer measurement back and forth over the centuries and it came to a halt. The computer stopped and put up a red signal, which meant that there was something wrong either with the information fed into it or with the results as compared to the standards.
  They called in the service department to check it out and they said 'what's wrong ?' Well they found there is a day missing in space in elapsed time. They scratched their heads and tore their hair. There was no answer. Finally, a Christian man on the team said, 'You know, one time I was in Sunday School and they talked about the sun standing still.'
  While they didn't believe him, they didn't have an answer either, so they said, 'Show us'. He got a Bible and went back to the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with 'common sense.'
  There they found the Lord saying to Joshua ,'Fear them not, I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.' Joshua was concerned because he was surrounded by the enemy and if darkness fell they would overpower them.
  So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That's right--'The sun stood still and the moon stayed---and hasted not to go down about a whole day!' The astronauts and scientists said, 'There is the missing day!'
  They checked the computers going back into the time it was written and found it was close but not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua's day was 23 hours and 20 minutes--not a whole day.
  They read the Bible and there it was 'about (approximately) a day' These little words in the Bible are important, but they were still in trouble because if you cannot account for 40 minutes you'll still be in trouble 1,000 years from now. Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits. As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible where it said the sun went BACKWARDS.
  The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but they got out the Book and read these words in 2 Kings: Hezekiah, on his death-bed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah who told him that he was not going to die.
  Hezekiah asked for a sign as proof. Isaiah said 'Do you want the sun to go ahead 10 degrees?' Hezekiah said 'It is nothing for the sun to go ahead 10 degrees, but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees..' Isaiah spoke to the Lord and the Lord brought the shadow ten degrees BACKWARD! Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes! Twenty three hours and 20 minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in Second Kings make the missing day in the universe!

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: Though it has been debunked countless times over the past several decades, there are no doubt some Christians who still believe this tale and perhaps even find it rife with irony. Who would have thought that science, the nemesis of faith, would inadvertently be harnessed to prove one of God's cosmic miracles true? Certainly not the scientists themselves, who work so hard to undermine biblical values with their secular theories on the origins of man and the universe.
  The person ultimately responsible for the story didn't see it that way, however. I'm talking about Harry Rimmer , a Presbyterian minister and amateur archaeologist whose life's mission, succinctly summarized in the title of his 1936 book The Harmony of Science and Scripture , was to bring the two seemingly incompatible world views together. That he had to forge said 'harmony' out of speculation and hearsay doesn't seem to have troubled him much.
  Rimmer told of an encounter that took place toward the end of the 19th century (well before the advent of NASA, obviously) between a Bible-believing Yale professor named C.A. Totten and a skeptical British astronomer named Sir Edwin Ball. Having pored over a set of mystifying calculations for hours on end, Ball approached Totten and confided that he had discovered an entire day 'lost out of time' -- 24 missing hours that he couldn't account for scientifically. Totten suggested that the answer might be found in the pages of the Holy Bible.
  Intrigued by the suggestion, Ball began working his way through the scriptures and found a tentative solution in the tenth chapter of Joshua, where it is written that God caused the sun and moon to stand still for one day. But there was a discrepancy. According to Ball's own calculations, a day only lasted 23 hours and 20 minutes in Joshua's time, the astronomer told Totten. 'If the Bible made a mistake of forty minutes, it is not the Book of God!' Unruffled, Totten pointed his skeptical friend back to the scriptures, where in due time Ball discovered, in the second book of Kings, the account of God turning the sundial back 10 degrees.
  'This settled the case,' Harry Rimmer concluded, 'for ten degrees on the sundial is forty minutes on the face of the clock! So the accuracy of the Book was established to the satisfaction of this exacting critic.' Unfortunately, Rimmer could offer no documentation for this anecdote and no one has ever been able to find record of it outside of his book. As it happens, C.A. Totten himself had published a volume in 1890 purporting to prove the biblical accounts of the missing day and the backward-moving sundial true mathematically, but in it he made no mention of an encounter with a skeptical astronomer. And far from grounding his argument in science, Totten used calendrical calculations based on the assumption that the universe was only 6,000 years old.
  After Rimmer, the 'missing day' story languished in comparative obscurity for decades, turning up now and again in Christian tracts and sermons until the 1960s, when it was revived by Harold Hill , an engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who later went on to serve as president of the Curtis Engine Company. Hill, who died in 1986, always maintained that his version of the story was true, but given the glaring similarities between his account and Rimmer's there can be little doubt that Hill simply updated it for a space-age audience and claimed it as his own. In How to Live Like a King's Kid , an inspirational book published in 1974, Hill explained how the story became common currency. He often told it, he wrote, when lecturing to high school and college students on the subject of science and the Bible. Apparently someone liked it so much they transcribed it and mailed it around, and by 1970 versions naming Harold Hill as their sources began appearing in midwestern newspapers. Indeed, when we look at examples of those news stories from 36 years ago (the one below is from the News Journal of Mansfield, Ohio, dated April 11, 1970), there is verbiage exactly matching what we find in the emails still circulating today:
  And so on. Unsurprisingly, Hill, like his predecessor Harry Rimmer, could not document the story. In a form letter he sent out in response to public queries, he claimed to have 'misplaced' relevant details such as names and places. 'I can only say,' he wrote, 'that had I not considered the information to be reliable, I would not have used it in the first place.'
  NASA scientists addressed the reliability of Harold Hill's information from a technical standpoint in a March 25, 1997 website feature entitled ' Ask an Astrophysicist ,' essentially pooh-poohing the very premise of the story. The future orbits of the planets aren't calculated by going 'back and forth over the centuries' to plot their past positions, they explained. It's done with simple, highly accurate formulae that can predict any future position of a planet based on its current position. 'This calculation would not cover any time before the present, so some missing day many centuries ago, if it had occurred, could not be uncovered with this method,' the scientists wrote.
  'In general,' they concluded, 'trying to prove events that are said to have occurred in the Bible, using scientific principles, doesn't work. Most scientists draw a clear distinction between things that are taken on faith, and those that are testable and therefore falsifiable . Science deals with the later, and religion with the former.'

"The Poison Dress","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Poison-Dress.htm","2015-10-25 18:53:06","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Poisoned Dress,' 'Embalmed Alive,' and 'Dressed to Kill'
  Example: Submitted by a reader, March 1999...
  I remember what I consider to be an urban legend that circulated when I was younger, always around prom time. If I remember correctly, it was about a girl who wanted to go to the prom, but she was very poor. Well, she decided to save some money and go to the pawn shop and buy a secondhand dress. She bought a beautiful blue dress, went to the prom and had a wonderful time. The next day, her mom found her dead in her bed. When the doctors examined her, they found traces of embalming fluid in her body that had soaked through her pores when she danced. They went to the pawn shop and found that the dress had come from an undertaker's assistant who had stolen the dress of a corpse and hocked it for money.
  Example: From the Indiana State University Folklore Archives, 1970...
  This lady died, and she wasn't very old. A couple of her sisters went out to buy a dress to bury her in, and they couldn't decide between this yellow one or the purple one, so they took both of them with them to get approval from the rest of the family. They left both the dresses at the funeral home and later decided on the purple one, so they called the undertaker. I don't know if the undertaker didn't understand, but he had the yellow dress on her the next morning when the family came in. They told him about the mistake, and he exchanged the dresses, and they returned the yellow one to the store. A few days later a girl bought the yellow dress and wore it to a dance. During the dance she began sweating because the place was really full. After a few minutes she dropped dead. The stuff the undertaker had used had been so thick on the dress that it had killed her.

  Analysis: Sometimes it's a blue dress, sometimes a yellow one, sometimes the crux of the narrative is a white wedding dress. The particulars vary but the denouement is always the same: a woman dies, poisoned by her own dress, a secondhand garment whose previous wearer had been a corpse.
  Folks have been telling the story since the 1930s, though the 'poisoned clothing' motif dates back much further -- to ancient Greece, in fact, and the myth of Medea . As it was told by the Greek playwright Euripides in the 5th century B.C., the 'witch goddess' Medea murdered Glauce, her rival for Jason's hand, by presenting her with a poisoned dress as a wedding gift. The dress burned Glauce alive (see also: Hercules and the robe of Nessus ).
  Inasmuch as the modern tale hinges on the supposed deadliness of physical contact with embalming fluid (or straight formaldehyde, in some variants), folklorists have long regarded it as apocryphal. 'As for the threat of real embalming fluid,' Jan Harold Brunvand wrote in a 1992 analysis of the legend, 'I once heard from a journalist who had asked a mortician about this point in the story. The mortician opened a bottle of the fluid and splashed some over his own face, saying, 'Does this answer your question?'' According to safety information provided by manufacturers, prolonged skin contact with embalming fluid may cause 'irritation in hypersensitive individuals,' but not death.
  Some commentators have pointed out that early variants of the story name specific department stores at which the tainted dress was supposedly purchased, concluding that its original purpose may have been to malign particular businesses. Not that I find this implausible, but I wonder if it doesn't miss the point.
  The place of purchase varies in the telling, as do the type and color of the dress, the nature of the occasion for which it's bought, and the specific chemical(s) it's allegedly contaminated with. What doesn't vary are the claims that 1) the dress had been previously worn by a corpse, and 2) the next person to wear it wound up equally dead.
  I believe this story expresses, above all, a fundamental horror of death itself, which is why we're still sharing it some eighty years after it was first told.

"About That Thing with Richard Gere and the Gerbil ...","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/richard_gere.htm","2016-01-23 16:23:36","  I don't mean to sound cranky, but it's more than a bit wearisome that the first thing that pops out of some people's mouths when they learn I write about urban legends is, 'What about that thing with Richard Gere and the gerbil ? Is that true?'
  You learn a lot about human nature in this racket. Or should I say, a lot of your worst suspicions about human nature are confirmed, time and time again.
  Like, people everywhere are suckers for gossip about sex.
  Weird sex. The-weirder-the-better sex. We're obsessed with it, in fact, and that seems to short-circuit our capacity for rational thought.
  How many here already know what ' gerbilling ' is? Raise your hands.
  Now, how many of you actually believe that anyone really does this sort of thing on a regular basis?
  Raise your hands.
  I see. Shame on you.
  For those of you still sitting in the dark, here's a definition: gerbilling (sometimes referred to as gerbil stuffing ) is the practice, most often attributed to gay men, of inserting a live rodent into one's rectum (or that of a partner) for erotic pleasure.
  And what are the known facts about gerbilling? In reality, it's not a 'practice' of any group of people, gay or otherwise. And while the activity, dangerous as it may be (gerbils have claws!), has surely been tried by someone, somewhere, sometime — maybe even more than once — it is not, if I may repeat myself, a common erotic pastime in any known culture or subculture, gay, straight, or otherwise.
  The burden of proof is on those who claim otherwise .
  The specific rumor we're here to address goes something like this:
  Several years ago, 'they' say, Richard Gere was admitted into the emergency room of a Los Angeles hospital with a foreign object lodged in his rectum. Some say Gere was alone when he arrived, others say he was accompanied by a friend (former love interest Cindy Crawford tops the list).
  In any case, an x-ray was taken and it was determined that the foreign object was a gerbil (either alive or dead at that point, depending on who tells the story). Mr. Gere was rushed to surgery, where it literally took a team of doctors to extract the unfortunate animal. Some say the gerbil was found to have been shaven and declawed; others claim it had been encased in a special plastic pouch. I've even heard it said that the gerbil was Gere's own beloved pet (appropriately named 'Tibet' in this variant). In any event, when the gerbilectomy was done the medical team was sworn to secrecy (unsuccessfully, we must conclude), and Gere went on his merry way, suffering no permanent harm other than to his reputation.
  'Is it true?' you ask.
  There isn't a shred of evidence that it ever happened. And while Gere himself has neither confirmed nor denied it — indeed, he has rarely spoken of it at all — neither have credible witnesses come forward in the twenty-some-odd years this story has been circulating to offer firsthand testimony to back it up.
  'I've never worked harder on a story in my life,' National Inquirer reporter Mike Walker told the Palm Beach Post after spending months trying to verify the rumor in 1995.
  He came away convinced he'd been chasing an urban legend.
  Richard Gere wasn't the only, nor even the first, American celebrity to be defamed with such allegations. Identical rumors circulated during the 1980s about a Philadelphia TV news anchorman , and later about a certain linebacker for the Cleveland Browns.
  How, why, and where did the story come to be attached to Richard Gere? No one knows, exactly. Some commentators point out that shortly after Gere achieved national attention for his appearance in the film Pretty Woman , an anonymous hoaxer forged a fax alert purporting to originate from the ASPCA deriding the actor for what it labeled 'gerbil abuse.' The accusation bounced from one end of Hollywood to the other, and beyond. But whether this was the legend's actual point of origin remains uncertain.
  Why would someone invent such a story? For the same reasons any vicious rumor about a celebrity gets started. Movie stars are wealthy, powerful people, always in the public eye and always, therefore, the subject of envy.
  They're walking targets for defamation. There exist in this world people who seek to bolster their own self esteem by sullying other people's reputations — by trying, in essence, to steal a bit of that celebrity's fame and glory for themselves. So it has been since time immemorial.
  The story bears every hallmark of an urban legend .
  While the basic narrative has remained consistent through the years, smaller details have varied and mutated, exactly as one would expect in a story told and retold tens of thousands times over.
  Like every classic urban legend, the tale of Richard Gere and the gerbil conveys a moral message, perhaps best articulated, if half-facetiously, by Cecil 'The Straight Dope' Adams: 'Stick to mammals your own size.'
  Lastly and most poignantly, the presumption that the story is valid always rests on the alleged personal experience of witnesses other than the storyteller, someone who was 'there when it happened' but who is always at least two or three acquaintances removed from the person speaking or writing.
  Here's a verbatim example from (where else?) the Internet:
  And another:
  Everyone I've questioned who reported having heard the story offers some variation of the the above: 'I know someone who knows someone who was working in that hospital when it happened.'
  Based on how frequently that claim has been made, I calculate there must have been no fewer than a hundred thousand people on staff at 'that hospital' ( Cedars Sinai ) that night. Surely you know one of them, too.
  Update: In 2006, actor Sylvester Stallone publicly stated that he believes Richard Gere blames him personally for starting the rumor. Or was Stallone slyly trying to take credit for it? You be the judge.

"The Microwaved Pet","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/microwaved_pet.htm","2015-03-01 16:33:03","  By David Emery
  Legend has it...
  A friend of a friend had a grandmother who was a little bit 'dotty,' as the family liked to say. One day after bathing her miniature poodle, Pierre, Grandma was preparing to towel-dry him when the phone rang. It was her daughter calling to remind her that they had arranged to meet for lunch a half hour earlier. Grandma apologized for being late and said she'd be there as quickly as she could.
  As she began drying Pierre's fur, it dawned on her that there was a quicker way to do it — the microwave. So she put her beloved pet inside the oven, set the dial to 'defrost' and switched it on.
  A half a minute later, as Grandma was donning her coat to leave, she heard a muffled explosion in the kitchen.
  Pierre the poodle was no more.
  Analysis: In classifying this story as an urban legend , I don't mean to suggest that nothing of the kind has ever happened — surely it has. I am suggesting that, generally speaking, when a tale such as this is told as 'true,' the teller has no direct knowledge nor any evidence whatsoever to back it up.

  Having heard the story secondhand, he or she simply assumes it is true (or might be true) and passes it on, with or without personal flourishes. This is a defining characteristic of urban legends .
  'The Poodle in the Microwave' (a.k.a. 'The Microwaved Pet') enjoyed its first wave of popularity in the mid-1970s. In part, it's a cautionary tale reflecting societal ambivalence toward technological change (a recurrent theme in contemporary folklore). Greater convenience entails greater risks, such stories seem to say, so we should approach new technologies with caution. Yet 'The Microwaved Pet' also hearkens back to warnings dating back to the 1940s, if not earlier, about dogs and cats suffering injury or death after crawling unnoticed into old-fashioned gas ovens. While one can always quibble over the 'function' or deeper meanings of urban legends, it's safe to say that they almost always serve as a barometer of our everyday fears.

"The Stolen Penguin","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalsinsects/a/penguin.htm","2016-01-17 21:22:42","  By David Emery
  In an unusual press conference held at Boston's New England Aquarium in late 2005, officials sought to reassure the public that all of the institution's 61 penguins were present and accounted for, notwithstanding a persistent rumors to the effect that a 12-year-old autistic boy had made off with one of the flightless birds in his backpack.
  Aquarium spokesman Tony Lacasse, who said in a press conference that he has received hundreds of emails and phone calls about the alleged penguin theft from around the country, labeled the tale a '100 percent certifiable urban legend.'
  As the story goes, the boy had gotten lost while visiting the penguin habitat with his mother and seemed quite agitated when she found him, so she took him home and drew a warm bath to calm him down. Awhile later, when she heard loud splashing noises coming from the bathroom, she went in to check and found her son in the company of a full-grown penguin.  He admitted sneaking the bird home in his backpack.

  Stolen penguin tale is at least a decade old
  Not possible, says Lacasse, who notes that the penguin pool is six feet deep and the slippery birds 'fly' through the water at astonishing speeds. What's more, penguins are wild animals with beaks as sharp as razors. It would be hard enough for an adult to heft one out of the pool, let alone a 12-year-old child.
  Though brand new to the Boston Aquarium, the story is at least a decade old and appears to have originated in the Republic of Ireland.  A typical variant, circulating on the Internet since 2003, goes like this:
  A friend's family had spent the day at Dublin Zoo, a very successful day right up until the end of the picnic lunch when they realised their six-year-old son was missing. Along, it should be noted, with his lunchbox and rucksack. Much frantic searching eventually revealed the youngster, dirty and disheveled but otherwise apparently okay, round the back of the penguin enclosure. The errant son was in big trouble and the day out ended there. He said nothing all the way home, sitting apparently full of remorse, in the very back of the people carrier, curled up with his coat and rucksack. When they arrived home he ran straight upstairs for a bath without any bidding at all. He clearly knew he was in very big trouble.
  He stayed in the bathroom for over an hour before his mother decided his verbal assurances were not enough. She opened the door to the sight of her beloved son sharing his bath with a small but perfectly formed and very, very real penguin.
  Yep, her son had kidnapped a baby penguin and smuggled it back home in his rucksack. The zoo, it has to be said, were not amused and called the police. However, after much argument and a character reference from the boy's form teacher no charges were pressed. But the family were warned never to return to the zoo.
  It has been theorized, probably correctly, that the sudden resurgence of the urban legend stateside was inspired by the November 2005 release of the popular documentary March of the Penguins on DVD.
  2006 Update:
  In November 2006, the story erupted again in Boston and St. Louis, apparently inspired by the release of Happy Feet , an animated film featuring singing and dancing penguins.

"The Roommate's Death","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/roommate.htm","2016-05-31 04:04:08","  By David Emery
  As told by Felicia McEntire...
  This story has been told over and over in my town (Harrison, Arkansas). Here goes...
  There were two college roommates, Sarah and Megan. Sarah was the theatrical type and loved acting. She was in all the town's plays. Megan was more of a book person, she loved to read and her studies were her first priority.
  Anyway, there was a huge play called 'Oh, Susannah' that Sarah was in, and it was coming up on Saturday ... so every chance that Sarah got, she would practice in the park (that's where she got her inspiration) for hours. Every time, she would beg Megan to go with her, but Megan would stay in the dorm and read.
  Well, on Saturday Sarah was a hit. Being the star, she was detained after the play, and got home really late. As she entered, she heard her roommate's rocking chair squeaking in the corner, but couldn't see it, not all the lights were on. Must be waiting for me, Sarah thought. Putting her stuff away, she went back into the main room.

  From the corner came a voice. It sounded rather husky, but that wasn't what agitated Sarah.
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...' came the voice.
  'Stop it Megan! Don't give me that crap, okay?' said Sarah.
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop it! I mean it, Meg!'
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop!!!!! That's it!!!!' Sarah screamed as she flicked on the room's lights.
  Sarah gawked in horror at the sight. Her roommate's body was in the rocking chair , but her head wasn't, her head was on the wall, kept there by a butcher knife. From behind the rocking chair she could hear laughter – maniacal laughter.
  'Who's there? Who are you?'
  From behind the rocking chair jumped a man, later found out to be the butcher that escaped from the sanitarium in the next town. All the time he was cutting Sarah, he was singing, over and over, 'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me... I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee.'
  Pinning Sarah to the wall next to her roommate's head, he screamed, 'Now, Susannah, don't you cry for me!!!!'
  Analysis: Before the term ' urban legend ' became popular, folklorists referred to tales of this kind as 'migratory legends' because they pop up from place to place over time, studded with localized details to enhance their credibility and emotional impact. The legend retold above is a hometown variant of 'The Roommate's Death,' which dates back to the 1960s and shares motifs with ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? ' and ' Humans Can Lick, Too .'
  One thing that distinguishes this version of the story from others is 'Oh, Susannah,' the killer's chant. The repetition of this line from the chorus of the old folk song not only ratchets up the horror of the moment when the murderer's presence is revealed, but suggests — because he is clearly aware that she has been rehearsing a play called 'Oh, Susannah' — that he has been stalking and observing her for quite some time.
  Another way this version differs from other retellings is how it ends: Instead of escaping with her life (traditionally, the story is given a 'close call' ending), the protagonist is left helpless in the clutches of the crazed killer who murdered her roommate.

  Also known as 'The Stuffed Baby'
  As told by a reader:
  A woman and her 4 year old son are visiting a border town on the Mexican side of the Texas/Mexico border. As they are walking towards the border crossing to return to the U.S., a man runs up to her and takes her child. She immediately runs to the authorities and a search ensues.
  The lady and the authorities begin walking among the cars looking for her son. The woman spots her child in a truck a couple of rows over. Her son is laying his head on the shoulders of man and appears to be sleeping.
  As the authorities close in on the vehicle, the driver jumps out of line and makes a run for it. As they are driving off, the passenger opens his door and dumps the child out into the street. As the woman and the authorities reach the child they find, to their horror, that the child has not only been murdered but has been cut open and illegal drugs have been put inside his body.
  It appears that the persons in the vehicle were drug smugglers and had decided to kidnap a child, kill them and place the drugs in the body. They would then hold the child as they approached the border and the border agents would think that the child was quietly sleeping on the shoulder of the passenger.

  God Bless you in this united effort to spread the word. You just might save a life!
  Analysis: It's always a treat to see a well-worn urban legend retooled for circulation on the Internet. Such is the case with a familiar horror story dating from the early 1970s claiming that drug smugglers have been known to use the corpses of abducted, murdered children to transport their illegal goods across national borders. We first encountered the version immediately above 1998. It continues to circulate to this day.
  Customs and law enforcement officials tell us the story isn't true. In all the decades this grisly legend has been in circulation, no real instances matching the descriptions above have been confirmed or documented.
  The legend, or the bare bones of it, anyway, got its first mainstream media airing in 1985 when the Washington Post recounted it as factual in the interests of livening up a feature about crime problems in Miami. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand noted in his mid-'80s collection of urban legends, The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton, 1986), the Post quickly found out that the story was untrue and retracted it a week later.
  The published correction read, in part:
  In the opening paragraph of an article last Monday on crime in Miami, the Washington Post recounted a story that cannot be substantiated. The story, told to a Post reporter several years ago by a Miami undercover agent, involves the smuggling of cocaine into the United States in the body of a dead baby.
  Clifton Stallings, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, said 'the story has been in circulation for some time. No one at Customs in Miami can verify it.' - Washington Post , March 30, 1985
  One customs official told the Post he had heard the story as long ago as 1973. As it was told in those days, he said, a suspiciously immobile child was spotted by an attendant on a flight from Colombia to Miami. Customs agents investigated and found that the baby, apparently deceased for some time, had been 'cut open, stuffed with cocaine and sewn shut.' It was considered a prime example of just how ruthless of international drug traffickers can be.
  As told on the Internet, it has became a much more compelling story. Set just across the U.S.-Mexico border and recounted in true 'friend of a friend' fashion ('My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas,' a frequently shared variant begins), the cautionary tale now carries a dual moral message: Drugs are evil, and never let your children out of your sight. Represented as a parent's 'true' nightmare, the online version concluded with a prayer that the story would convince people to stop using drugs. The more likely result is that has reinforced many people's already well-entrenched fears.

  Further putting the lie to this misbegotten rumor are the results of an independent investigation conducted in 2001 by the Anti-Defamation League , which summarized its findings in a letter to Tommy Hilfiger :
  The Anti-Defamation League has received recurring inquiries regarding a number of defamatory rumors that have been spread on the Internet and by word-of-mouth in recent years about you and your company. Based upon our investigation, it is apparent to us that you never made the statements that attribute racist remarks to you. In some cases, the rumor alleges that you appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and made racist remarks, causing a supposedly irate Oprah to ask you to leave. We have concluded that these rumors are completely false, and it is apparent that you never made the statements attributed to you, nor did you appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
  Check the facts before you share a scurrilous email or social media post. All of this information is readily available on the internet. Look it up. There is no excuse for perpetuating this false rumor, for bearing false witness against a neighbor, when the truth is only a few links away.

"Mel Gibson: The Real Life "Man Without a Face?"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/Mel-Gibson-A-Real-Life-Man-Without-a-Face.htm","2016-08-16 19:20:44","  By David Emery
  In this common urban legend, a tale of great courage and inspiration, a young man manages to overcome the odds despite a physical handicap.
  The legend is usually shared via email, with something like the below:
  Subject: True Story
  Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully)
  Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even a stagehand gig came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered  the worse section of town.
  Walking home from work one evening, this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money, the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp. They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road, they assumed he was dead and called the morgue.
  On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all his teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared, he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired.
  When the young man started to look for work again, he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as 'The Man Who Had No Face'. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years.
  One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church, he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life.
  The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.
  The priest, through his personal contacts, was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worst, was filled with good humor and love.
  The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly.
  The young man is Mel Gibson.
  His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie The Man Without A Face . He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.'
  While Mel Gibson certainly has had an interesting life, it is not the stuff of which high drama is made. Born in 1956 in Peekskill, New York, he moved to Australia with his family at the age of 12, but the young man was a loner and a heavy drinker with no particular direction in life.
  It was his older sister, Mary, who set Gibson's future career in motion by submitting an application in his name — and without his knowledge — to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney. Having nothing to lose, he auditioned and was accepted. He proved to be a talented actor and lived theatrically ever after.
  His first big break in the movies occurred in 1979 when he landed the starring role in a low-budget Australian flick called 'Mad Max,' which soon attracted a cult following. There's an anecdote surrounding this early triumph which presumably inspired our apocryphal email story.
  About a week before the big audition, he got drunk at a party and wound up in a fistfight with three other men. And lost. 'I woke up in the bloody hospital with head stitches, a busted nose, my jaw off the hook, peeing blood,' he recalled in a 1995 Playboy interview. He was 'still a mess' on the day of the audition, but ironically it was his busted-up face that caught director George Miller's attention and won Gibson the part as the film's post-apocalyptic antihero.
  Be that as it may, he did not require a year in the hospital to recover, nor was he left permanently disfigured, nor did he join a circus freak show and spend five years wandering and horribly depressed. On the contrary, he healed quickly, shot Mad Max that same year and went on to become one of the world's most sought-after leading men.
  He did, in fact, later direct and star in The Man Without a Face , the 1993 film adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. In it, he played a reclusive teacher whose face had been horribly scarred as a result of an automobile accident. But the script wasn't based on Gibson's own life, not even remotely. As a matter of fact, the novel from which the film was adapted was first published in 1972.
  Mel Gibson was 16 years old at the time.

"90# Telephone Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/90-Telephone-Scam.htm","2016-08-08 01:29:25","  By David Emery
  Urban legends about phones are extremely common. One of the most prevalent is the one about not dialing #90 or #09, due to threats from terrorists.
  Subject: Fwd: Phone Scam (fwd)
  Hi everyone,
  A friend sent me this e-mail today to warn me and anyone else of yet another phone scam. Beware.
  I received a telephone call from an individual identifying himself as an AT&T Service Technician that was running a test on our telephone lines. He stated that to complete the test I should touch nine (9), zero (0), pound sign(#) and hang up. Luckily, I was suspicious and refused.
  Upon contacting the telephone company we were informed that by pushing 90# you end up giving the individual that called you access to your telephone line and allows them to place a long distance telephone call, with the charge appearing on your telephone bill. We were further informed that this scam has been originating from many of the local jails/prisons.
  Please pass the word.
  As shocking as this may sound, the 'nine-zero-pound' story is sort of true.
  What the warning letter floating around the internet doesn't say is that this scam only works on telephones where you have to dial 9 to get an outside line. Unless you have to dial 9 to get an outside line at home, this scam does not affect residential telephone users. Dialing 'nine-zero-pound' on a residential phone will only give you a busy signal. That's it.
  On some business phones, however, dialing 'nine-zero-pound' may transfer a call to an outside operator and give the caller the opportunity to call anywhere in the world and charge it to your business' phone bill ... maybe. It all depends on how your business' telephone system is set up. If your company doesn't require you to dial 9 to get an outside line (for example, if you have a direct outside telephone line on your desk or if your company's phone system requires you to dial a number other than 9 to get an outside line) the 'nine-zero-pound' scam does not affect you. Also, if your company's phone system is set up so that you cannot make a long distance call once you have accessed an outside line (a lot of companies now limit all outside lines to local calls only), the 'nine-zero-pound' scam does not affect you either.
  The 'nine-zero-pound' story only affects those businesses that require you to dial 9 to get an outside line and then place no restrictions on who or where you can call once you get that outside line. However, keep in mind that for residential phone users, and particularly for cell phone users, there is no danger of dialing any combination of the listed numbers. This legend may have been somewhat true 20 years ago, but with new technology, is not an issue any longer. However, every now and again it pops up in chain letters to cause more confusion and worry.

"The Cigar Arsonist - an Urban Legend","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/The-Cigar-Arsonist-an-Urban-Legend.htm","2016-08-17 00:13:14","  By David Emery
  Netlore Archive: North Carolina man takes out fire insurance on pricey stash of rare cigars; he smokes them and files claim, according to an urban legend circulating since the 1960s. Who do you think prevailed in court?
  This story is decades old and likely originated as a joke. A much briefer version appeared in a 1965 toastmaster's manual and was apparently the direct inspiration of the earliest Internet variant, posted in a Usenet discussion in February 1996:
  Here's the same tale set in North Carolina in this Usenet version dated February 1997:
  A North Carolina man, having bought several expensive cigars, insured them against... get this... fire. After he had smoked them, he then decided that he had a claim against the insurance company and filed. The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigar normally. The man sued. The judge stated that since the company had insured the cigars against fire, they were obligated to pay. After the man accepted payment for his claim, the company then had him arrested for... arson.
  As the story traveled via email, it grew longer and more detailed, and by 1997 the latter-day version set in Charlotte, NC had become standard. David Boraks, a reporter for the Charlotte Observer , tried vainly to authenticate it. 'Somewhat sheepishly,' he wrote, 'I've tried to verify the cigar story. But searches of court records and newspaper files fail to turn up a single case or N.C. news article matching the incident.' Not that anyone should be surprised.
  A new variant claiming the scheming cigar aficionado was himself a lawyer began circulating in mid-2002 Here's an email contributed anonymously in 1997:
  FW: Subject: Our wonderful legal system
  A Charlotte, North Carolina man, having purchased a case of rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against (get this) fire! Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company.
  In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars 'in a series of small fires.' The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued -- and won! In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that the cigars would be insured against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire, it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.
  Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company grudgingly accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in the fires. After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one-year terms.
  So don't piss off your insurance company!

"Did Pepsi Omit "Under God" in Its Patriotic Can Promotion?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/Did-Pepsi-Omit-Under-God-in-Its-Patriotic-Can-Promotion.htm","2016-08-17 15:55:24","  By David Emery
  'Don't buy Pepsi in the new can!' This baseless email campaign hoax circulating since August 2002 protests the alleged omission of the words 'under God' in an excerpt from the Pledge of Allegiance featured on new Pepsi cans.
  This false and utterly pointless call to arms against Pepsi-Cola is a variant of an email protest originally aimed at the manufacturer of a different soft drink — Dr Pepper — way back in February 2002.
  Dr Pepper cans did, in fact, carry a short excerpt from the Pledge of Allegiance during a patriotically-themed promotion that lasted for a few months in 2001 and 2002. However, Pepsi — which is manufactured by a different company altogether — has never run such a promotion, nor announced any plans to do so. There is no new Pepsi can with the Empire State building or words from the Pledge of Allegiance on it.
  You've received an erroneous email about a 'patriotic can' that Pepsi allegedly produced with an edited version of America's Pledge of Allegiance. The truth is, Pepsi never produced such a can. In fact, this is a hoax that has been circulating on the Internet for more than six years. A patriotic package used in 2001 by Dr Pepper (which is not a part of PepsiCo) was inappropriately linked to Pepsi. Thanks for giving us the chance to clarify the situation and please feel free to share this message with anyone else who may have received the erroneous email.

  Pepsi has a new patriotic can coming out with pictures of the Empire State Bldg. and the Pledge of Allegiance on them. But Pepsi forgot two little words on the pledge, 'Under God.' Pepsi said they did not want to offend anyone.
  If this is true, then we do not want to offend anyone at the Pepsi corporate office. If we do not buy any Pepsi product then they will not receive any of our monies. Our money after all does have the words 'Under God' on it.
  Please pass this word to everyone you know. Tell your Sunday School class tomorrow and tell your Pastors so that they can tell the whole congregation.
  Christians, stand up and let your voices be heard.
  We want the words 'under God' to be read by every person who buys a can.

  A viral message circulating since 1999 contends that the word 'picnic' originated in southern 'family outings' during which white people joyfully lynched African Americans. This Folk etymology is an online rumor.
  This email appears to be a parody of political correctness at its worst. It is false from start to finish, beginning with the description of the 'Black African-American Archives at the Smithsonian Institute,' claiming that whites routinely made a pleasant family event that involved the lynching of African Americans.
  You can find the etymology of the word 'picnic' by consulting any dictionary. Merriam-Webster Online gives the following origin:
  Take Our Word for It, an online magazine that details the origins of words, provides more detail here . Upon receiving many inquiries about this chain letter, they contacted the Smithsonian Institution.
  Dr. Alonzo Smith, a research fellow in African-American Studies at the Smithsonian, replied with a detailed debunking, including the following comments:
  The lynching of African Americans by whites is an undeniable horror, and this feeble attempt at humor as only serves to diminish the seriousness of its history.

  Subject: FW: 'PICNIC'
  This e-mail comes to you as a public service announcement and as information in the form of a little known Black History Fact. This information is in the African American Archives at the Smithsonian Institute.
  Although not taught in American learning institutions and literature, it is known in most Black history professional circles and literature that the origin of the term 'picnic' derives from the acts of lynching African-Americans. The word 'picnic' is rooted from the whole theme of 'Pick A Nigger.' This is where individuals would 'pic' a Black person to lynch and make this into a family gathering. There would be music and a 'picnic.' ('Nic' being the white acronym for 'nigger') Scenes of this were depicted in the movie 'Rosewood.' To be racially sensitive, we should choose to use the word 'barbecue' or 'outing' instead of 'picnic.'

"Salaries of Charity CEOs: Real or Inflated?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/Salaries-of-Charity-CEOs-Real-or-Inflated.htm","2016-08-19 04:59:35","  By David Emery
  A viral text circulating since October 2005 purports to compare the salaries of top executives of U.S. and Canadian charitable organizations.The information is mostly false and outdated. Even a cursory comparison of the two messages below, collected five years apart, reveals that much of the information contained in the 2010 version was repeated verbatim from the text originally distributed in 2005 — yet the 2005 version wasn't accurate in first place!
  As of 2005, these were the most up-to-date and trustworthy salary figures for the executives originally listed:
  Is one charity necessarily more respectable than another just because its leader is paid a lower salary? Not necessarily, according to Charity Navigator, a website that evaluates and compares the financial health of charitable organizations.
  'While there are certainly some charities that overpay their leaders,' the site's FAQ page explains, 'Charity Navigator's data shows that those organizations are the minority. Among the charities we've evaluated, the average CEO salary is $150,000...These leaders could inevitably make much more running similarly sized for-profit firms. Furthermore, when making your decision [about where to donate] it is important to consider that it takes a certain level of professionalism to effectively run a charity and charities must offer a competitive salary if they want to attract and retain that level of leadership.'
  Here's a sample email text posted online on November 3, 2010:
  Ever wonder where that donation money goes?
  Keep these facts in mind when donating. As you open your pockets for yet another natural disaster, keep the following salary facts in mind; we have listed them from the highest (worse paid offender) to the lowest (least paid offender).
  The worst offender yet again for the 11th year in a row is the UNICEF CEO; he receives $1,200,000 per year, (plus use of a Royal Royce for his exclusive use where ever he goes and an expense account that is rumored to be well over $150,000.) Only pennies from the actual donations goes to the UNICEF cause (less than $0.14 per dollar of income).
  The second worst offender this year is Marsha J. Evans, President and CEO of the American Red Cross...her salary for the year ending in 2009 was $651,957 plus expenses. She enjoys six weeks of fully paid holidays including all related expenses during the holiday trip for her and her husband and kids. She also receives a 100% fully paid health and dental plan for her and her family, for life. This means out of every dollar they bring in, about $0.39 goes to related charity causes.
  The third worst offender again for the 7th time was Brian Gallagher, President of the United Way who receives a $375,000 base salary plus so many expense benefits it's hard to keep track as to what it is all worth, including a fully paid lifetime membership for two golf courses (one in Canada, and one in the US), two luxury vehicles, a yacht club membership, three major company gold credit cards for his personal expenses...and more. This equates to about $0.51 per dollar of income that goes to charity causes.
  The fourth worst offender who was also again in the fourth spot, for every year since this information has been made available since 1998 is yet again, World Vision President (Canada) who receives a $300,000 base salary (plus fully furnished a home valued in the $700,000 - $800,000 dollar value range, all housing expenses including taxes, water/sewer, telephone/fax, HD/high speed cable, weekly maid service and pool/yard maintenance, fully paid private schooling for his children, an upscale automobile and a $55,000 personal expense account for clothing/food, with a $125,000 business expense account). And because World Vision is a 'religious based' charity, it pays little to no taxes, can receive government assistance and does not have to declare where their money goes. Only about $0.52 of earned income per dollar is available for charity causes.
  On the flip side, of the sixty some odd 'charities' researched, the lowest paid President/C.E.O/Commissioner was The Salvation Army's Commissioner Todd Bassett who receives a salary of only $13,000 per year (plus housing) for managing the $2 billion dollar organization. That means about $0.93 per dollar earned is goes back out to local charity causes.
  No further comment is needed...Think twice before you give to your charity of choice.
  Here's email text contributed by Galaine on Oct. 26, 2005:
  As you open your pockets for yet another natural disaster, keep these facts in mind:
  Marsha J. Evans, President and CEO of the American Red Cross receives a salary for year ending 06/30/03 of $651,957 plus expenses.
  Brian Gallagher, President of the United Way, receives a $375,000 base salary plus numerous expense benefits.
  The Salvation Army's Commissioner Todd Bassett receives a salary of only $13,000 per year (plus housing) for managing this $2 billion dollar organization.
  No further comment necessary.

"Did Neil Armstrong Say "Good Luck, Mr. Gorsky!" on the Moon?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/Did-Neil-Armstrong-Say-Good-Luck-Mr-Gorsky-on-the-Moon.htm","2016-08-17 04:23:07","  By David Emery
  Were astronaut Neil Armstrong's actual first words upon setting foot on the surface of the moon 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky'? This urban legend has been circulating since 1995.
  This whopper of a tall tale has been distributed online for years and can be found on any number of blogs and websites accompanied by the claim that it really happened. But it didn't happen, as can be easily verified by checking the official  lunar landing transcript on NASA's Apollo 11 site (audio and video clips are included).
  Sometimes attributed to stand-up comedian Buddy Hackett, 'Good Luck, Mr. Gorsky' clearly was created as a joke, evolving into an urban legend over time through sheer repetition as a true story. In spite of the ease with which this revisionist history of the Apollo moon landing and moonwalk is debunked, it will doubtless be with us for decades to come.
  A related urban legend popular among Muslims claims that Armstrong heard a voice say ' Allahu akbar ' ('God is great') the moment he stepped on the moon and was inspired to convert to Islam.
  Never happened.
  Are you SURE 'Good Luck, Mr. Gorsky' was a hoax? Read additional details about the urban legend.
  Here's a forwarded email on the topic contributed by Byzantia on April 15, 1999:
  Here is a TRUE anecdote about Neil Armstrong:
  When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' statement but also followed it by several remarks, usual communication traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control. Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made this remark: 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.'
  Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the statement 'Good luck Mr. Gorsky', but Armstrong always just smiled.
  On July 5, 1995 in Tampa Bay FL, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.
  When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. and Mrs. Gorsky.
  As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky. 'Sex! You want sex?! You'll get sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!' True story.

"Niagara Falls Frozen in 1911","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/fl/Niagara-Falls-Frozen-in-1911.htm","2016-08-20 21:22:13","  By David Emery
  Does Niagara Falls ever really freeze over like this?' The answer is yes. During an extended winter cold snap a hardened crust of ice can accumulate over parts of the falls — American Falls in particular — creating an amazing, naturally-formed ice sculpture that has been known to reach a thickness of 50 feet.
  Neither the river nor the falls ever freezes solid . The water continues to flow beneath the ice at all times, albeit reduced to a mere trickle on rare occasions when ice jams block the river above the falls. Historically, when this blanket of ice has spanned the entire Niagara River, the phenomenon has been known as the 'ice bridge.' Just as you see in the photos, people used to stroll and frolic on and around the frozen falls and even walk across the ice bridge, though no one has been allowed to do the latter since 1912, when the bridge unexpectedly broke apart and three tourists died.
  As the Washington Post wrote,  a 'frozen' Niagara falls was not an unusual occurrence:
  Niagara Falls gets cold every year. The average temperature in Niagara Falls in January is between 16 and 32 degrees. Naturally, it being that cold, ice floes and giant icicles form on the falls, and in the Niagara River above and below the falls, every year. The ice at the base of the falls, called the ice bridge, sometimes gets so thick that people used to build concession stands and walk to Canada on it. It’s nothing out of the ordinary. It is not, to put it bluntly, big polar vortex news.
  All of the photographs appear to be authentic, though it's unlikely any were actually taken in 1911.
  The first in the set, a sepia-toned photograph listed as an Internet find on the website of the Niagara Falls Public Library, is of unknown date and origin, according to the documentation. The image also appears on the Niagara Falls Live website, where its placement implies it was taken during the historic freeze of March 1848 when the falls actually 'went dry' for a few days due to the formation of an ice dam on Lake Erie.
  The second image, a panoramic view of American Falls, the infamous ice bridge, and the 'ice mountain' dotted with ant-like human visitors, was reproduced a few years ago on a now-defunct website called Nostalgiaville. The photo was dated 1936. The Washington Post reported on February 2 of that year that the falls had indeed 'frozen dry' for the second time in history.
  Image three is a scan of a picture postcard, originally hand-tinted, displayed on the Niagara Falls Public Library Web site. The card was postmarked August 25, 1911 (though the photograph probably wasn't taken in that year), and bore the following caption:
  'The cave of the Winds, gyved with a marvelous accumulation of ice and the great flow of water completely hidden by crystalline helmets. Such a sight is rarely to be witnessed, however for history records only three, the last time in 1886, when it is said, a million persons visited Niagara to see the marvelous exhibition of the ice king.'
  The fourth image, entitled 'Great Mass of Frozen Spray and Ice-Bound American Falls Niagara,' is also from the Niagara Falls Public Library collection, where it is cataloged as a stereo image by Underwood & Underwood. It is dated 1902.

  Take a look at these six cards. Now pick one card — and only one — and remember it. Concentrate!
  Are you thinking of the card? Excellent.
  I will now, read your mind -- even though we're not in the same room and possibly not even on the same continent.
  Okay, I've got it. I know which card you chose. I will now make it disappear ...
  Voila! It's gone! Amazed? Don't be. Read on to learn how this simple trick is done.
  This is one of the simplest yet most effective mind reading illusions ever devised. How does it work? Take another look — a careful look — at the 'before' and 'after' card layouts, and it will become clear: Do you see it?
  The difference, aside from the fact that there's one fewer card in Figure 2, is that none of the cards in the second layout are the same as in the first. Not only did your chosen card disappear — they all disappeared and were replaced them with completely different but similar cards.
  Like most magic tricks, this one depends on misdirection which is a kind of deception — the audience is focused on one thing in or to distract attention from something else.
  There are two kinds of misdirection: the first method, which is time sensitive, encourages the audience to look away for a brief moment so that the magic trick or sleight of hand can be accomplished without detection.
  The second approach consists of reframing the audience's perception and has nothing to do with the senses. Here, the minds of the audience are distracted into thinking that focusing on an unimportant object is responsible for the resulting magic, when it really doesn't have any impact on the effect at all
  That's precisely the case with this trick — because you've been instructed to focus your attention and memory on one card and only one card, most of us fail to absorb any details about the other five. When the entire set is replaced by a different one that looks approximately the same, we accept it as exactly the same.
  Abracadabra!

"Does the Wingdings Font Contain Cryptic Prophecies?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/Does-the-Wingdings-Font-Contain-Cryptic-Prophecies.htm","2016-08-18 00:33:31","  By David Emery
  A viral message circulating since September 2001 notes interesting results obtained by typing certain strings of letters (eg, 'Q33 NY,' 'Q33NYC') into Microsoft Word and then converting the font to Wingdings. This email rumor is false.
  I encourage you to try the experiments below exactly as instructed to see the results for yourself. Here's what all the fuss is about:
  Both the Webdings and Wingdings fonts, available in Microsoft Word and compatible programs, consist of small graphic icons in place of the standard letter set. If you convert any block of text to either Wingdings or Webdings, you end up with a string of simple pictures instead of letters.
  Wingdings have been around slightly longer than Webdings, and indeed it was first observed back in the early 1990s that converting the letters 'NYC' to Wingdings produces results described as 'interesting':
  
  At the time, some folks not only saw a hidden message in this but leaped straight to the conclusion that it must have been intentional.
  A 1992 article in the New York Post even proclaimed, in screaming headlines, 'Millions of computers carry secret message that urges death to Jews in New York City!'
  The Microsoft Corporation, which had bundled the font with the release of its Windows 3.1 software earlier that same year, vehemently denied the charges, responding that any so-called 'secret messages' were purely coincidental, and that allegations of anti-Semitism were 'outrageous.'
  When Microsoft added the Webdings font to its system several years later, it only strengthened the convictions of those who believed there were hidden meanings embedded in the software. And no wonder. Here's what 'NYC' looks like in Webdings:
  
  How coincidental could that be?
  The likeliest explanation is grounded in speculation that the designers of Webdings, having learned from experience that people with too much time on their hands will inevitably hunt for secret messages, intentionally planted the rebus 'I love New York' to taunt them. It's one example of what software designers call an ' Easter egg .'
  The even more bizarre notion that digitized fonts might actually be prophetic in a supernatural sense first gained currency in 1999, when doomsday predictions of all kinds already abounded. Naturally, some clever person discovered that typing the word 'MILLENNIUM' in Wingdings produces this dramatic result:
  
  Once disseminated to a doomsday-obsessed audience online, this nugget of trivia was soon  characterized as 'eerie,' 'spooky' and 'a weird coincidence.' As we now know, millennial doomsayers of every stripe were simply wrong. However,  in the interim, 'fontlore' veered away from vague doomsaying toward pure prophecy.
  Which brings us to 'Q33NY'--according to email lore, this was the flight number of one of the airliners that crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. In Wingdings the string of characters looks like this:
  
  Some people interpret this as a direct reference to the terrorist attack. It's all there — the airplane, the Twin Towers (perhaps a stretch as those symbols also look like documents), a skull and crossbones (symbolizing death) and the Star of David (apparently meant to represent anti-Israeli sentiments on the part of the hijackers).
  Problem is, neither of the airliners involved in the attack on the World Trade Center bore the number 'Q33NY.' The actual flight numbers were American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175.
  Nor does the character string 'Q33NY' represent the FAA-registered tail number of either aircraft. The Flight 11 tail number was N334AA and the Flight 175 tail number was N612UA.
  It's clear, then, that someone carefully fabricated the sequence of numbers and letters in 'Q33NY' to achieve the desired effect in Wingdings. No 'spooky prophecy' or 'weird coincidence'--just an Internet hoax.
  Here an email contributed by James A. on Sep. 20, 2001:
  Subject: FW: Scary
  One of the planes that hit the Trade Center towers was flight number Q33NY
  1) Open a new Word document and type in capital letters Q33NY 2) Highlight it 3) Enlarge the font to 48 4) Click on Font Style and select 'Wingdings' You will be amazed!!
  Sample email contributed by Tiffany on Sep. 19, 2001:
  Subject: Did Bill Gates know?
  Try this: 1 Open up Microsoft word 2 In a new document, type NYC in capitals 3 Highlight and change the font size to 72 4 Change the font to Webdings 5 Now change the font to Wingdings

"The Killer in the Backseat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/killer_backseat.htm","2015-09-18 14:38:30","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Emily Dunbar:
  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911 !'

  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.
  The moral of the story: Always check the back seat!
  Analysis: In another common variant of this legend, the imperiled female (and it's always a female, please note) pulls into a gas station and is frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who keeps trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. It turns out he has glimpsed a knife-wielding murderer in the backseat and is trying to save her life!
  Folklorists have traced the legend back to the 1960s and believe it may have been inspired by a vaguely similar real event in 1964 involving the discovery by a New York City policeman of an escaped murderer hiding in the backseat of his (the cop's) own car.
  'The Killer in the Backseat' was among the legendary horror stories dramatized in the 1998 film Urban Legend . Let us not assume, however, that real-life evildoers never lie in wait for their victims in the backseats of vehicles. As reported in the Decatur Daily News on September 14, 2007, a female college student in Alabama was threatened by a man with a gun who popped up suddenly in the backseat of her SUV. She escaped, fortunately, by slamming on the brakes and bolting from the car.
