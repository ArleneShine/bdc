  Analysis: Don't panic, it's a joke. It gives itself away as such in the very first sentence:
  There is no such medical journal. There is no 'United Medical Association.' If 'Dr. Beverly Clark' has ever had an article published in any legitimate scientific publication, for some mysterious reason it does not turn up in online searches. Moreover, there have been no recent news reports of spider-caused deaths among air travelers in Chicago.
  Nor, for that matter, is there a 'Blare Airport' in Chicago (try O'Hare International Airport ); nor a restaurant in Chicago (or anywhere else on earth) called 'Big Chappies.'
  Lastly, there is no real genus of spider known as Arachnius gluteus (apparently meant to be translated 'butt spider').
  Update: New Variant - A new version of this hoax first spotted in 2002 alleges that an Asian spider called the Two-striped Telamonia is now migrating to the U.S. under airliner toilet seats and has already killed five women in North Florida.
  Note: Australian Redback Spider - I've heard from several Aussie readers keen to point out that there is a spider in Australia known as the Redback ( Latrodectus hasselti ), the bite of which can be toxic and which is famous in popular lore — much like its American relative, the Black Widow — for residing under outdoor toilet seats. Though ' Arachnius gluteus ' remains a fiction, it is not without its precedents in real life and world folklore.

  A viral tale tells about a 'very pleasant attendant' who showed up every day at Bristol Zoo in England for 25 years running to collect parking fees from visitors — then one day simply vanished with all the cash. What really happened to 'The Bristol Zoo Parking Attendant'?

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  If ever there was a story too good to be true, this is one. Not only has a crack team of journalists from the Bristol Evening Post conducted a thorough investigation and found the tale of the phantom car park attendant to be 'nothing more than an urban myth,' they have also succeeded in pinning down its exact point of origin: the Bristol Evening Post themselves.
  'A version of the story did appear in the Evening Post two years ago,' explained an article in the June 13, 2009 edition, 'in a feature on urban myths published to coincide with April Fools' Day.'
  In other words, at the time of the self-expose, it was a five-year-old April Fools' prank gone viral. There's nothing more to it than that. For the record, the Bristol Evening Post article further stated that Bristol Zoo actually owns more than one car park — several, in fact, none of which are open to coaches (buses) — with a comparable number of duly-hired attendants on the job.
  This is an example of why many publishers ban April Fools articles. They can easily take on a life of their own, separate from their original publication date when the joke may be more apparent. Also, April Fools is not a universal tradition. With the global scope of the internet, what might be seen as a humorous 'gotcha' prank story in one country will be seen as actual news in others.

  An incorrigible atheist and his ACLU lawyer go before a judge to complain that while Christians celebrate Christmas and Easter, and Jews observe Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, there is no such public holiday, or 'holy day,' for atheists. The judge begs to differ. Full story below.
  Description: Viral joke / Urban legend Circulating since: 2003 (this version) Status: False (details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by L. McGuinn, Jan. 29, 2004:
  WAY TO GO, JUDGE!
  In Florida, an atheist became incensed over the preparation for Easter and Passover holidays and decided to contact his lawyer about the discrimination inflicted on atheists by the constant celebrations afforded to Christians and Jews with all their holidays while the atheists had no holiday to celebrate.
  The case was brought before a wise judge who after listening to the long, passionate presentation of his lawyer, promptly banged his gavel and declared, 'Case dismissed!'
  The lawyer immediately stood and objected to the ruling and said, 'Your honor, how can you possibly dismiss this case? Surely the Christians have Christmas, Easter and many other observances. And the Jews -- why in addition to Passover they have Yom Kippur and Hanukkah... and yet my client and all other atheists have no such holiday!'
  The judge leaned forward in his chair and simply said 'Obviously your client is too confused to know about or to celebrate the atheists' holiday!'
  The lawyer pompously said 'We are aware of no such holiday for atheists, just when might that be, your honor?'
  The judge said 'Well it comes every year on exactly the same date-- April 1st!'

  Analysis: Although several readers have forwarded the above story to me for verification, it's quite obviously a joke at the expense of unbelievers , and not based on any actual court records or news reports I could find. The earliest iteration of the text I've come across online is dated June 2, 2003.
  Another version of the story attributed to the 'Maryland Church News,' was published in the 1997 edition of The Speaker's Quote Book by Roy B. Zuck (Kregel Publications):
  An atheist complained to a friend because Christians have their special holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, and Jews celebrate their national holidays, such as Passover and Yom Kippur. 'But we atheists,' he said, 'have no recognized national holiday. It is unfair discrimination.'
  To which his friend replied, 'Why don't you celebrate April first?'
  And yet another, more minimal variant was published seven years before that in, of all places, an advertisement for Sunday church services in the Wellsboro, Pennsylvania Gazette , March 28, 1990:

"The Barrel of Bricks","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/barrel_bricks.htm","2016-08-23 06:34:44","  By David Emery
  As told by Cory Vandenham...
  I am a general contractor and heard this story from an insurance investigator.
  A bricklayer working on a three-story-tall chimney had set up a pulley system so that his helper could raise the bricks up to where he needed them. As he was working, his helper complained about how difficult it would be to get the last of the bricks up to the flat roof of the building. Just then another contractor had some material delivered and it was placed on the roof by a fork lift brought to unload it. The bricklayer asked if the driver would load the rest of the bricks up there as well and the driver agreed. The bricklayer realized that he would not need his helper any more and sent him home.
  When the bricklayer completed the chimney he noticed that he had quite a few bricks left over and that the fork lift was no longer at the jobsite. Now he had to figure out how to get the leftover bricks back down by himself. If he dropped them, they would surely break. So he decided to use the pulley he had set up earlier to lower them down.

  First he went down to the ground and raised a large metal bucket up to the roof level using the rope and pulley. Next, he tied the rope off onto a railing and climbed back up to the roof and loaded the bricks into the bucket. Then he went back down to the ground. He knew that the bricks would be heavy, so he wrapped the rope around his hand a couple of times and then untied the end of the rope with his other hand. Well, the bricks were heavier than he imagined and with physics being as it is, he was immediately launched upwards at a high rate of speed.
  As he was racing up towards the roof he encountered the bucket full of bricks coming down at an equally fast rate. He collided with the bucket and broke his nose and his shoulder. The bucket passed him by as he sped upwards. He reached the pulley just before the bucket hit the ground and broke a few of his fingers as they were pulled into the pulley. When the bucket hit the ground, its bottom fell out and all of the bricks spilled onto the ground. Now the fun reversed. As the now light bucket sped upwards, the mason took a shot to the groin when one of his legs slipped into the empty bucket.
  He then tilted enough to fall out of the bucket and continued with his gravity experiment. Eventually he landed on top of the pile of bricks and broke both feet. He collapsed in pain there on the bricks, but was glad to be alive. He let go off the rope and cried out for help.
  It was then that the bucket hit him in the head and fractured his skull.
  Analysis: This is quite an old story, reckoned by folklorists to date back at least 80 years. It's a comedy staple, in fact, having turned up in numerous recordings, radio shows, movies and novels since the 1930s.
  And newspapers. A classic version that made the rounds in the late 1950s under headlines on the order of ' Saddened Bricklayer Asks for Sick Leave ' was attributed to an anonymous bricklayer in Barbados.
  A variant of the tale was published as a 'True Fact' by National Lampoon in 1986, when it was also circulating from workplace to workplace as 'office faxlore.' More recently it has been sighted on email joke lists, a multitude of websites and blogs, and social media.

  Circulating via email and social media, this has to be the funniest, most outrageous 'college application essay' ever written. Is it real? Yes. Was it written for the purpose of applying for college? No.
  Description: Satire / Email hoax Circulating since: 1990 Status: Not an actual application essay (details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by Bruce G., June 25, 2000:
  This is an actual essay written by a college applicant to NYU in response to this question:
  3A. IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?
  I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently.
  Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row. I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.
  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.
  I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat 400.
  My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me. I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations with the CIA.
  I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.
  On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.
  I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.
  But I have not yet gone to college.

  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  Analysis: This satirical essay — or a version of it — was written in 1990 by high school student Hugh Gallagher , who entered it in the humor category of the Scholastic Writing Awards and won first prize. The text was then published in Literary Cavalcade , a magazine of contemporary student writing, and reprinted in Harper's and The Guardian before taking off as one of the most forwarded viral emails of the 1990s. Though it was not Gallagher's actual college application essay, he did submit it as a sample of his work to college writing programs and was accepted, with scholarship, to New York University, from which he graduated in 1994. Since then he has worked as a freelance writer. His first novel, Teeth , was published by Pocket Books in March 1998.

"Biscuits for Brains","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/biscuit_brain.htm","2015-10-15 14:46:08","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Brain Drain,' 'The Killer Biscuits,' 'Killer Biscuits Wanted for Attempted Murder,' etc.
  As told by reader Vanessa Berger...
  There was a sweet older lady who would often do grocery shopping for the infirm and elderly in her church. One hot, summer day a lady asked her to pick up a few things and bring them by her house in a dangerous part of Baltimore City. The sweet old lady was wary but felt that she couldn't say no, even though she was terrified of driving in the part of the city that often had shoot-outs and other drug violence. Anyway, the woman went on her way, picked up the groceries and proceeded to the lady's house.
  As she entered the lady's neighborhood she noticed young hoodlums gathering on every street corner. Although she had no air conditioning in the car, she rolled the windows up tightly (as a safety precaution) and suffered in the 90+ degree heat.
  She drove ahead until suddenly she heard a loud 'POP!' and felt a jolt to the back of her head. She reached to feel the back of her head and came back with a wet oozing mess that she was sure was part of her brain! Knowing that she had been shot, the woman turned around and raced to a local hospital.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Somehow she made it to the emergency room and had the strength to walk right in. She told the attendant that she had been shot. Immediately she was rushed back to an exam room. Doctors whirled around and asked where she had been shot (since they saw no blood.) She said 'my head,' and the doctors found a mass of the oozing white substance the woman had first noticed.
  Upon inspection the doctors realized that the white substance wasn't part of her brain but was instead a lump of biscuit dough (the kind in a can) that had exploded from the heat of her car!
  Analysis: Vanessa's marvelous retelling of this popular tale (which has also been circulating as a viral email since around 1998) has all the vivacity and attention to detail of an old-fashioned, word-of-mouth urban legend. Her uncle swears it really happened to a 'sweet old lady' in his church. In all likelihood, of course, it did not.
  As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported in his 1999 book Too Good to Be True , the story he calls 'The Brain Drain' first began showing up in newspaper columns, stand-up comedy routines , and Internet discussions during the mid-1990s. A Usenet forum posting dated July 18, 1995 attributes it to comedienne Brett Butler:
  Sue, have you ever heard Brett Butler's story about her sister-in-law (or some such relative): driving home from the grocery store with a bag of groceries in the seat behind her; it was unbelievably hot weather; she stopped at a convenience store to get a soda or something and started toward home again. All of a sudden she heard this really loud explosion and felt something hit her in the back of the head. She put her hand up (but not too close) and felt something mushy. She was convinced she had been shot and her brains were falling out!
  When she finally pulled into her driveway and started screaming/honking for someone to come out and help her, they discovered a can of biscuits in the grocery bag had exploded and hit her in the head. Ha ha ha.
  In August 1995 the story was retold by a paramedic as follows:
  One of our trucks recently were toned to respond to the GSW to the head. The victim called 911 via her cellular phone. She told the operator that she just sat down in her car and someone shot her in the back of the head. She told the dispatched that she was afraid to move because she could feel brain tissue hanging out the back of her head.
  When the crew arrived, they found the woman sitting in the front seat. Her groceries were in the back seat. The Medics found dough where the woman thought that she felt brain tissue. A can of biscuit dough in the shopping bag exploded and hit her in the back of the head. Needless to say, the woman was greatly relieved to find that out.
  'Funny but true,' the author went on to write — and in that three-word statement is encapsulated the critical distinction between a joke and an urban legend .

  Netlore Archive: A self-described 'spectacularly beautiful' woman posts an online personals ad stating her wish to pair off with a marriageable 'rich guy' in New York City.  Wall Street banker replies, 'Your offer... is plain and simple a crappy business deal.'
  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: September 2007 Status: Unknown (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Gregory D., October 11, 2007:
  THIS APPEARED ON CRAIG'S LIST
  What am I doing wrong?
  Okay, I'm tired of beating around the bush. I'm a beautiful (spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. I'm articulate and classy. I'm not from New York. I'm looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don't think I'm overreaching at all.
  Are there any guys who make 500K or more on this board? Any wives? Could you send me some tips? I dated a business man who makes average around 100 - 150. But that's where I seem to hit a roadblock. 150,000 won't get me to central park west. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married to an investment banker and lives in Tribeca, and she's not as pretty as I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right? How do I get to her level?
  Here are my questions specifically:
  -Where do you single rich men hang out? Give me specifics - bars, restaurants, gyms
  -What are you looking for in a mate? Be honest guys, you won't hurt my feelings
  -Is there an age range I should be targeting (I'm 25)?
  -Why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the upper east side so plain? I've seen really 'plain jane' boring types who have nothing to offer married to incredibly wealthy guys. I've seen drop dead gorgeous girls in singles bars in the east village. What's the story there?
  -Jobs I should look out for? Everyone knows - lawyer, investment banker, doctor. How much do those guys really make? And where do they hang out? Where do the hedge fund guys hang out?
  -How you decide marriage vs. just a girlfriend? I am looking for MARRIAGE ONLY
  Please hold your insults - I'm putting myself out there in an honest way. Most beautiful women are superficial; at least I'm being up front about it. I wouldn't be searching for these kind of guys if I wasn't able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a nice home and hearth.
  --------------------
  THE ANSWER
  Dear Pers-:
  I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament. Firstly, I'm not wasting your time, I qualify as a guy who fits your bill; that is I make more than $500K per year. That said here's how I see it.
  Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a crappy business deal. Here's why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring my money. Fine, simple. But here's the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity...in fact, it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won't be getting any more beautiful!
  So, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation accelerates! Let me explain, you're 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in earnest. By 35 stick a fork in you!
  So in Wall Street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy and hold...hence the rub...marriage. It doesn't make good business sense to 'buy you' (which is what you're asking) so I'd rather lease. In case you think I'm being cruel, I would say the following. If my money were to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades I need an out. It's as simple as that. So a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage.
  Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, I wonder why a girl as 'articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful' as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500K hasn't found you, if not only for a tryout.
  By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then we wouldn't need to have this difficult conversation.
  With all that said, I must say you're going about it the right way.
  I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of lease, let me know. ____________ Rob Campbell J.P.Morgan Diversified Industrials Investment Banking 277 Park Avenue, 16/F, New York , NY 10172

  Analysis: Craigslist is a classified ad website which also attracts its fair share of pranksters, so the authenticity of the above exchange — which began on September 25, 2007 with the post entitled 'What am I doing wrong?' — has been questioned by some people right along.
  'It does look as if the post was made sincerely,' a Craigslist spokesperson told the New York Times two weeks after it first appeared. But reporters' queries to the anonymous poster's mailbox have gone unanswered, and — to no one's surprise, really — she(?) has not stepped forward to claim authorship.
  The Wall Street banker's response bears the signature line of Rob Campbell, an actual employee of J.P. Morgan Chase & Company's investment banking division, but the company denies he authored it, stating that Campbell merely forwarded the message as received, whereupon his email program automatically appended his signature line. This is perfectly plausible given that the same thing happens to 'frequent forwarders' all the time. What's more, the exchange was already making the rounds before Rob Campbell's name became attached to it.
  A well-known Craigslist prankster has also denied authoring the reply.
  Hoax or not, the complementary postings function well together as a humorous commentary on the current state of the 'Battle of the Sexes,' which, as folklorists Dundes and Pagter noted in their 1991 collection Never Try to Teach a Pig to Sing: Still More Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire , remains fraught with tensions 'as old as humankind itself.'

  Netlore Archive: North Carolina man takes out fire insurance on pricey stash of rare cigars; he smokes them and files claim, according to an urban legend circulating since the 1960s. Who do you think prevailed in court?
  This story is decades old and likely originated as a joke. A much briefer version appeared in a 1965 toastmaster's manual and was apparently the direct inspiration of the earliest Internet variant, posted in a Usenet discussion in February 1996:
  Here's the same tale set in North Carolina in this Usenet version dated February 1997:
  A North Carolina man, having bought several expensive cigars, insured them against... get this... fire. After he had smoked them, he then decided that he had a claim against the insurance company and filed. The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigar normally. The man sued. The judge stated that since the company had insured the cigars against fire, they were obligated to pay. After the man accepted payment for his claim, the company then had him arrested for... arson.
  As the story traveled via email, it grew longer and more detailed, and by 1997 the latter-day version set in Charlotte, NC had become standard. David Boraks, a reporter for the Charlotte Observer , tried vainly to authenticate it. 'Somewhat sheepishly,' he wrote, 'I've tried to verify the cigar story. But searches of court records and newspaper files fail to turn up a single case or N.C. news article matching the incident.' Not that anyone should be surprised.
  A new variant claiming the scheming cigar aficionado was himself a lawyer began circulating in mid-2002 Here's an email contributed anonymously in 1997:
  FW: Subject: Our wonderful legal system
  A Charlotte, North Carolina man, having purchased a case of rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against (get this) fire! Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company.
  In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars 'in a series of small fires.' The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued -- and won! In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that the cigars would be insured against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire, it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.
  Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company grudgingly accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in the fires. After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one-year terms.
  So don't piss off your insurance company!

  Norton), that the specifics of the story above may be false. Brunvand contacted the police chief of Radnor, Pennsylvania, where most versions of the story say the ' Colander Copier Caper ' took place, and was told that despite repeated claims to the contrary in publications dating from the late 1970s on, no such incident ever occurred in the township.
  We also, interestingly enough, have reason to believe the story may be true. According to a letter written to Brunvand in 1993 by Judge Isaac Garb, who says he presided over the case in question, the sequence of events occurred pretty much as stated. 'I can confirm the veracity of the colander polygraph (lie detector),' Garb wrote. 'The matter came before me in court on a motion to suppress the confession.' Indeed, the only major discrepancy between Garb's account and the anecdotal version is the specified location. Most variants, including those published in newspapers, name Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, as the setting. Garb says it took place in Warminster Township, Bucks County, which would account for the Radnor police chief's denial. (Judge Garb's letter was published in Jan Harold Brunvand's 2001 book, Too Good to Be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends .)

  The item's earliest appearance in print was in the July 22, 1977 edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer , which named 'a small police department' in Bucks County as the locale. Four months later, this version was distributed nationwide by United Press International (story dated Nov. 18, 1977):
  There's Still One Born Every Minute
  RADNOR, Pa. (UPI) — The police department here recently was told by a Bucks County judge that a Xerox machine cannot be used as a lie detector.
  Detectives bent on obtaining a confession pretended an office copier was a lie detector after a suspect agreed to undergo a polygraph test. Prior to interrogation, the sleuths placed a typewritten card in the machine reading: 'He's lying.'
  The suspect was seated near the copier. A metal colander was fastened to his head and wires ran from the colander to the Xerox machine.
  Each time investigators received answers they did not fancy, they pushed the copy button.
  Out came the message: 'He's lying.'
  Convinced that the machine was infallible, the suspect finally confessed.
  Judge Ira Garb threw the case out of court.
  'It's the kind of comic relief we need around here once in a while,' the judge laughed.
  The incident was brought up again for comic relief in a March 13, 1978 Chicago Tribune feature on the societal impact of photocopy machines.  '[T]he top prize for imaginative use of copiers,' wrote reporter Paul Weingarten, 'goes to detectives in Radner [ sic ], PA. They put a colander on the head of one unsuspecting suspect and hooked it to the Xerox machine, but they told the suspect that the machine was a lie detector. He bought it.' (Tempo section, p. B5)
  From 'News of the Weird' to Internet meme
  The email version, which typically circulates as part of a compendium of allegedly-true 'dumb criminal' stories, looks to have been snipped verbatim from News of the Weird , Chuck Shepherd's volume of human interest stories published in 1989 (New York: New American Library). It made its way onto the Internet in the early '90s, spawning minimally reworded variants such as the this one:
  Variations on the fake polygraph trick have been used as a sub-plot in episodes of several TV crime series, including Homicide: Life on the Street , The Wire , and The Unusuals .

  Also known as: 'The Runaway Grandmother,' 'The Stolen Granny '
  A friend of mine knows a family who were on vacation, driving through some remote part of the country in their station wagon. They had brought Grandma along even though she was quite elderly and not feeling well, because her heart was set on going on this one last trip with her grandchildren, and they didn't want to disappoint her.
  Unfortunately, at some point during the long drive Grandma passed away in the back seat of the car. Her grandchildren, sitting on either side of her, became hysterical.
  Since they were several hours away from the nearest sizable city, the father did the only thing he could think of to remedy the situation. He wrapped Grandma's body in a thick blanket, secured it to the luggage rack on top of the station wagon, and drove on.
  When they finally reached the outskirts of civilization the father stopped at a service station and everyone clambered out of the car while he used a payphone to call authorities and report the death. Understandably nervous and upset, he didn't realize he had left the keys in the ignition.

  When the family went back to the car they found it had been stolen, along with all their possessions ... and Grandma.
  Analysis: If this story sounds familiar, that's no doubt because it's an exceedingly common FOAFtale (friend-of-a-friend tale) dating back (at least) to World War II. Folklorist Duncan Emrich reported a variant of it in his 1972 book Folklore on the American Land , and it has appeared in several collections of urban legends since.
  Or perhaps you recognize it as one of the more amusing subplots of the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation , or in Tom Robbins' 1971 novel Another Roadside Attraction .
  You may have even run across it in your local newspaper, written up as if it were a real-life occurrence.
  The Associated Press dispatched a brief item in December 1999, to cite one example, about an incident that supposedly happened in the former U.S.S.R. According to the article, a pair of Moldavan cousins living in Ukraine, both too poor to afford a funeral for their dead grandmother, rolled up her corpse in a carpet and strapped it to the top of their car to be taken home for burial.
  When the grieving cousins stopped for a meal at a restaurant in southern Ukraine, a gang of thieves made off with their car... and Grandma.
  Among the U.S. papers that ran this suspiciously familiar story was the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, where it appeared under the headline 'Thieves Take Rug – and Grandma's Corpse.'
  It caught the attention of Jan Harold Brunvand, Salt Lake City resident, professor emeritus at the University of Utah, and author of more than half a dozen books on urban legends, including the marvelous volume Too Good to Be True , published that same year.
  Brunvand fired off a letter to the Deseret News . 'Oh, come on, editor!' it began. 'Surely you didn't believe that AP story you published on Page A14 of the Dec. 9 Deseret News about the missing Moldavan granny. This is nothing but the old 'Runaway Grandmother' urban legend that has been told worldwide for decades.'
  As a matter of fact, he scolded, in 1987 the legend had appeared in the Deseret News itself, in one of Brunvand's own weekly columns, entitled 'Grandma's Fit to Be Tied — to the Luggage Rack.'
  Did the Associated Press and Deseret News bite on an old urban legend? According to Jan Harold Brunvand, they did. Some stories, like this one, really are 'too good to be true.'

  Example: As told by Jim Day...
  I first heard this back when I was 10 or 15 years old (about 1960 to 1965) from my father. He was a police officer in Columbus, Ohio and reported it as if it actually happened on the job. I have seen it in several forms, but usually it's one of those 'If you think you are having a bad day' deals.
  The story always entails a man and a sliding glass window that he fails to notice is closed and crashes into. As I originally heard it, he has the sliding glass door open while mowing the lawn so he can go into the house, get a drink of water and cool off. In this version, his wife closes the door when he isn't looking.
  In a more recent version, the guy rides a motorcycle into the door. He walks/rides through the plate glass and sustains non-life-threatening (but significant) cuts that require stitches.
  While he is en route to the emergency room, his wife, in a panic, cleans up or throws away gasoline associated with whatever activity was incidental to the accident. In the one where he was cutting the lawn, he had placed the gasoline for the mower in a glass jar. In the newer version, when he crashes the motorcycle he spills some of its gas on the patio. The wife cleans it up with paper towels. The gasoline (or gasoline soaked towels) end up in the household toilet.

  Later that day, when the now heavily-sutured hubby returns home, he decides to use the bathroom. After he sits down, he drops his lit cigarette in the toilet. It explodes, causing 2nd and 3rd degree burns on the man's rear and genitals. Once again, the paramedics come out to take him to the hospital.
  The most recent version of this story includes a final insult to the man where, as the wife is relating the causes of the accident to the next set of paramedics who show up, they laugh so hard they drop the man from the gurney onto the ground, causing a broken bone. (In the earlier version, the doctors or paramedics warn the man that his wife may be trying to kill him.)
  Analysis: Exploding toilet stories go way back, but the motorcycle variant repeated above is of recent origin and has been traced to a specific publication, Motorcyclist magazine, which published it in 1984 (and republished it in 1991).
  Note that the victim's wife is usually held to blame for the outcome of these stories, for it's she who dumps the explosive substance (gasoline, paint thinner, cleaning fluid, etc.) into the john.

"Did a Study Say Fellatio Decreases the Risk of Breast Cancer in Women?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/Fellatio-Breast-Cancer.htm","2015-05-28 15:49:08","  By David Emery
  Homemade web page masquerading as an AP news story published on CNN.com claims that women can decrease their risk of breast cancer by, quote, 'performing the act of fellatio on a regular basis.' Uh-huh. Some less-than-careful mainstream media outlets (they know who they are) bought this hoax hook, line, and sinker. Did you?
  Description: Web hoax / Joke Circulating since: Oct. 2003 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: As posted in an Internet forum, Oct. 9, 2003:
  Study: Fellatio may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer in women
  Thursday, October 2, 2003
  (AP) -- Women who perform the act of fellatio on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.
  Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.
  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.
  'I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act,' said Dr. B.J. Sooner of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. 'I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women.'
  The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.
  'Only with regular performance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine,' said Dr. Inserta Shafteer, one of the researchers at the University. 'Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances.'
  The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.
  In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.
  Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or 'play down' these findings.
  'This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases,' Lictepeen said.
  Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.
  'There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages,' he said.
  Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers.
  The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not. The group of women who had performed fellatio had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.
  'The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio,' Shafteer said. 'It's a cause, not THE cause.'

(A revised version was stripped of all graphics and references to CNN, presumably due to threats of litigation.)

"'Pluck Yew' - The Origin of 'The Finger'","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/fl/Pluck-Yew-The-Origin-of-The-Finger.htm","2016-06-26 16:28:55","  By David Emery
  How one of the most frequently-used curses in the English language — not to mention a certain profane gesture entailing the extension of one's middle finger — supposedly originated as a medieval battlefield taunt.
  Description: Joke / Folk etymology Circulating since: 1996 Status: False (details below)
  Example: As posted in Usenet discussions, December 1996:
  Subject: FW: Puzzler
  The 'Car Talk' show (on NPR) with Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers, have a feature called the 'Puzzler'. Their most recent 'Puzzler' was about the Battle of Agincourt. The French, who were overwhelmingly favored to win the battle, threatened to cut a certain body part off of all captured English soldiers so that they could never fight again. The English won in a major upset and waved the body part in question at the French in defiance. The puzzler was: What was this body part? This is the answer submitted by a listener:
  Dear Click and Clack,
  Thank you for the Agincourt 'Puzzler', which clears up some profound questions of etymology, folklore and emotional symbolism. The body part which the French proposed to cut off of the English after defeating them was, of course, the middle finger, without which it is impossible to draw the renowned English longbow. This famous weapon was made of the native English yew tree, and so the act of drawing the longbow was known as 'plucking yew'. Thus, when the victorious English waved their middle fingers at the defeated French, they said, 'See, we can still pluck yew! PLUCK YEW!'
  Over the years some 'folk etymologies' have grown up around this symbolic gesture. Since 'pluck yew' is rather difficult to say (like 'pleasant mother pheasant plucker', which is who you had to go to for the feathers used on the arrows), the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative 'f', and thus the words often used in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter. It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is known as 'giving the bird'.
  continue reading below our video
  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  Analysis: Pay no attention to the pseudo-academic bluster above concerning pheasant pluckers, labiodental fricatives and the English longbow. The text is a clever and amusing spoof, not meant to be taken seriously.
  Lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower, author of 'The F-Word' (Random House: 1999), says the 'totally ludicrous' tale erroneously conflates the etymology of the word f*ck with an older bit of folklore, itself questionable, purporting to trace the origin of the European 'two-finger salute' (roughly analogous to 'flipping the bird' in America) back to the taunts of British archers against the French during the Hundred Years' War .
  Etymologists say f*ck found its way into the English language from Dutch or Low German during the 14th century and made its first written appearance around 1500. The word pluck , on the other hand, is of Latin derivation and there is no known linguistic connection between the two English words. It's doubtful the expression 'Pluck yew' was ever uttered before 1996, when this apocryphal story first went into circulation online.
  The middle-finger gesture, which has apparently had phallic connotations in every culture in which it has been used, is much older. We know it dates back to ancient Greece, at least, where it was referenced in ' The Clouds ,' a play written by Aristophanes in 423 B.C. It was also well known to the Romans, who referred to it variously as digitus infamis ('infamous finger') and digitus impudicus ('indecent finger'). In all likelihood its origins were prehistoric.

  Viral 'news story' claims two men were injured in a 'gerbilling' mishap involving a tiny rodent, a cardboard tube and an untimely-lit match.
  Description: Fake news Circulating since: 1993 Status: False
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader in 1997:
  Direct from the LA Times:
  'In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil,' Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. Tomaszewski, and his homosexual partner Andrew 'Kiki' Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong.
  'I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in,' he explained. 'As usual, Kiki shouted out 'Armageddon', my cue that he'd had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn't come out again,so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.'
  At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. 'The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tubing, igniting Mr Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.'
  Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: Albeit attributed to the Los Angeles Times , this lurid bit of potty humor did not originate in any newspaper. Neither the content nor the style conforms to even the lowest of journalistic standards. It's fake news, a joke, or more precisely a joke bordering on an urban legend , because people insist on claiming it's true. Variants of the story can be found in Internet message board postings dating back to 1993.
  I'm obliged to point out that the term 'felching' is, um, sorely misused in the text. It's an actual slang word that refers to a sexual activity, and that sexual activity has something to do with rectums, but nothing to do with gerbils. Rather than attempt to provide a clinically correct definition of the term, I will refer you to the Internet . The Internet knows more about felching than you likely will want to know yourself. Fair warning.
  The narrative does revolve around an instance of what some like to call 'gerbilling' (or 'gerbil stuffing'), which, simply defined, is — supposedly — the act of inserting a live rodent into one's own or another person's anus for sexual pleasure.
  I say 'supposedly' because despite the fact that a name for such a practice exists, there's no evidence that the practice itself does. Quite the opposite, in fact. 'Both in my professional and personal life, thousands of guys have freely admitted to doing the most out-there, dangerous, risky, stupid, kinky stuff,' sex advice columnist Dan Savage wrote in 1998 . 'But not once in all these years has anyone ever told me that he, or anyone he knows, or anyone anyone he knows knows, has ever put a gerbil in his ass. Like the doomed gerbils themselves, this story has no legs. It is an urban legend.'
  The best known gerbilling story in popular culture is, of course, the Richard Gere story , in which it's said that the actor was supposedly rushed to an L.A. emergency ward many years ago to have a stuck gerbil removed from his rectum. Virtually everyone in America, I'm tempted to say, knows somebody who knows somebody who claims to have been right there when Gere was admitted to the hospital, or knows the surgeon who performed the gerbilectomy, or a nurse who was sworn to secrecy.
  Although Gere has never out-and-out denied the story — and really, who would ever want to actually say the words, 'No I didn't put a gerbil in my butt' — he did once mention it in a magazine interview in which he said, 'I stopped reading the press a long time ago. Lots of crazy things came up about me at first, especially from the tabloids. There is an infamous 'Gere stuck a hamster up his bum' urban myth.'
  The man doesn't know a hamster from a gerbil. What are the odds he had an intimate encounter with either one?

  January 4th 2014 – Planetary Alignment Decreases Gravity – Float For 5 minutes! #ZeroGDay
  It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014,  an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.
  Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: This may sound familiar to connoisseurs of April Fools Day pranks. It's a loose homage to what many consider to be one of the greatest leg-pulls of all time , namely a BBC radio broadcast on April 1, 1976 during which famed amateur astronomer Patrick Moore announced that an unusual planetary alignment would briefly counteract the force of gravity on Earth at 9:47 that morning.
  Anyone who jumped in the air at exactly that moment would experience weightlessness and a floating sensation, Moore promised. He labeled the phenomenon, which was supposedly the result of the planet Pluto briefly passing behind Jupiter, the 'Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.' Though the prediction was (and is) a load of codswallop — other planets in our solar system do, in fact, exert a gravitational pull on earthly objects, but the amount is infinitesimal — hundreds of radio listeners reportedly called in to say they had indeed felt weightless for a fleeting moment.
  Let's hope the silliness doesn't go that far this time around.
  March 2014 update: News-Hound has re-published the prank article , now claiming the miraculous planetary alignment occurs on April 4, 2014. Fooled us twice? I hope not!

"Did Jennifer Lopez Insure Her Butt for a Billion Dollars?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/celebrities/a/jennifer_lopez.htm","2016-01-15 18:23:03","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  Is it true that Jennifer Lopez insured her butt?
  Dear Reader:
  Thereby hangs a tale. Please bear with me.
  With the possible exception of that work in progress known as Michael Jackson's face, no celebrity body part in recent memory has achieved greater prominence than J. Lo's derriere. It's enthroned on fan websites as an object of veneration. It has inspired a new trend in below-the-waist surgical implants. Gossip columnists have worn out thesauri looking for superlatives to describe it: 'ample,' 'deluxe,' 'abundant,' 'big.'
  There's no getting around it, Jennifer Lopez's personal fame has very nearly been eclipsed by that of her own behind.
  Nor is there any getting around rumors of a comparably deluxe insurance policy. In 1999, tabloids on both sides of the Atlantic — The Sun in London and the New York Post — ran articles claiming that Jennifer Lopez had indemnified her body — her entire body, please note — to the tune of $1 billion.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Although pound-for-pound in these reports the singer's boobs fetched a more generous appraisal than her hiney ($100 million per breast vs. $300 million for legs and buttocks combined, according to the Post ), it wasn't long before word on the street had it that the 'abundant butt' alone was valued at a cool billion.
  Lopez has denied the whole darned thing. I think. I'm not sure.
  'I don't know where they got it from,' she said to reporters when questioned about the tabloid allegations in 1999. 'When I heard the story I thought it was very funny.'
  Noncommittal as that was, it was nowhere near as flaccid as her agent's response: 'At this time we cannot confirm or deny this information.'
  A droopier set of denials I have never read, yet they ran under unequivocal headlines such as 'Lopez Denies Insurance for $1 Billion' and 'Lopez: I'm No Billion Dollar Babe,' so we're obliged to conclude — a posteriori, as it were — that someone at some point must have uttered the words 'It's not true' in front of a journalist.
  Either that, or in Lopez-speak 'very funny' is synonymous with 'false.'
  The closest to a straightforward disavowal I've found in print appeared in an August 2000 interview with BeatBoxBetty.com in which Lopez was asked to name the 'wildest rumors' she had heard about herself.
  'The craziest,' she said, 'was the Billion Dollar Butt one. It was on the front page of the paper, here in New York. I happened to be in New York that week. It was funny.'
  'So you haven't insured your body?' pressed the interviewer.
  'I think that's what I'm trying to say here,' Lopez replied.
  I give up. Draw your own conclusion.

"In-N-Out Burger Cup Says "Hail Satan"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/fl/In-N-Out-Burger-Hail-Satan.htm","2016-08-23 06:44:51","  By David Emery
  There are parts of the United States where no one has ever heard of In-N-Out Burger , a west coast fast food chain known for the quality of its food and cleanliness of its restaurants (a fact), and rumored to be owned and operated by Christian fanatics (an exaggeration).
  For the benefit of the uninitiated, the rumor exists, in large part, because one of the many quirky features of In-N-Out Burger is its policy of printing biblical citations on its packaging — 'John 3:16' on the bottoms of soda cups, for example, 'Proverbs 3:5' on milkshake cups and 'Revelation 3:20' on burger wrappers.
  People find it odd and fascinating, especially the first time they encounter it, which is why there are hundreds of photos of these citations on the Internet.
  It's also why there's at least one photo of an In-N-Out cup that says 'Hail Satan' (see above).
  The devilish image has been making the Internet rounds for upwards of five years, and probably had its biggest spike in circulation when it turned up in a July 27, 2011 tweet by Weird Al Yankovic.
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Yankovic didn't create the image, mind you. According to Snopes.com there are postings of it dating back to 2010, and it may even be older than that.
  It's a hoax, of course. In the original photograph (on Flickr), the cup bore the inscription 'John 3:16.'
  The 'Hail Satan' version is obviously a sarcastic spoof of the actual Bible references on In-N-Out packaging, but that begs a question: Why are those references  there in the first place? Is it really because the owners of In-N-Out are religious zealots trying to convert the whole world to Christianity, burger by burger?
  Not exactly.
  The company has never issued an official explanation, but Dean Atkins, a regional manager for the food chain, was asked about the Bible references by the Gilroy Dispatch in 2006. Atkins said the practice started during the 1980s on the orders of Rich Snyder, one of the sons of In-N-Out founder Harry Snyder and by all accounts an evangelical Christian.
  'It was just something he wanted to do,' Atkins told the Dispatch (in other words, a whim). There's little evidence that other family members in the business shared his passion for evangelizing, but the practice was kept going after Rich Snyder died in a plane crash in 1993 'out of respect for him,' said Atkins.
  In any case, citing the Bible on its packaging doesn't seem to have hurt the company's success — in fact, who knows, maybe it helped by adding a soupçon of mystique. Other companies are starting to do it, too.
  By the same token, the circulation of an image of an In-N-Out cup bearing a satanic slogan doesn't seem to have hurt business, either. Food for thought.
  Bible references:
  John 3:16. 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'
  Proverbs 3:5. 'Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.'
  Revelation 3:20. 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.'

"The Hindenburg","http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/hindenburg.htm","2016-01-26 16:52:20","  In 1936, the Zeppelin Company, with the financial aid of Nazi Germany , built the Hindenburg (the LZ 129 ), the largest airship ever made. Named after the late German president, Paul von Hindenburg , the Hindenburg stretched 804-feet-long and was 135-feet-tall at its widest point. That made the Hindenburg just 78-feet shorter than the Titanic and four times larger than the Good Year blimps.
  The Hindenburg was a rigid airship definitely in the Zeppelin design. It had a gas capacity of 7,062,100 cubic feet and was powered by four 1,100-horsepower diesel engines.
  Although it had been built for helium (a less flammable gas than hydrogen), the United States had refused to export helium to Germany (for fear of other countries building military airships). Thus, the Hindenburg was filled with hydrogen in its 16 gas cells.
  On the outside of the Hindenburg , two large, black swastikas on a white circle surrounded by a red rectangle (the Nazi emblem) were emblazoned on two tail fins.
  continue reading below our video
  What are the Seven Wonders of the World
  Also on the outside of the Hindenburg was 'D-LZ129' painted in black and the airship's name, 'hindenburg' painted in scarlet, Gothic script.
  For its appearance at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin in August, the Olympic rings were painted on the side of the Hindenburg .
  The inside of the Hindenburg surpassed all other airships in luxury. Though most of the airship's interior consisted of gas cells, there were two decks (just aft of the control gondola) for the passengers and crew. These decks spanned the width (but not the length) of the Hindenburg .
  Deck A (the top deck) offered a promenade and a lounge on each side of the airship which was nearly walled with windows (which opened), allowing passengers to watch the scenery throughout their trip. In each of these rooms, passengers could sit on chairs made of aluminum. The lounge even featured a baby grand piano that was made of aluminum and covered in yellow pigskin, weighing only 377 pounds.
  Between the promenade and the lounge were the passenger cabins. Each cabin had two berths and a washbasin, similar in design to a sleeping room on a train. But in order to keep weight to a minimum, the passenger cabins were separated with only a single layer of foam covered by fabric. Toilets, urinals, and one shower could be found downstairs, on Deck B.
  The Hindenburg , a giant in size and grandeur, first emerged from its shed in Friedrichshafen, Germany on March 4, 1936. After only a few test flights, the Hindenburg was ordered by the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr. Joseph Goebbels , to accompany the Graf Zeppelin over every German city with a population over 100,000 to drop Nazi campaign pamphlets and to blare patriotic music from loudspeakers. The Hindenburg's first real trip was as a symbol of the Nazi regime.
  On May 6, 1936, the Hindenburg initiated its first scheduled transatlantic flight from Europe to the United States.
  Although passengers had flown on airships for 27 years by the time the Hindenburg was completed, the Hindenburg was destined to have a pronounced affect on passenger flight in lighter-than-air crafts when the Hindenburg exploded on May 6, 1937.

"The Haunted Painting","http://paranormal.about.com/od/trueghoststories/a/The-Haunted-Painting.htm","2015-11-15 17:31:59","  Can inanimate objects be haunted? Can a spirit attach itself to a particular thing and then cause unexplained events to occur around it?
  I received an interesting story from a reader, Laura P., whose avocation is painting. An accomplished painter, Laura has sold many of her works to individuals and businesses around the US. One painting in particular, however, is unlike any other that Laura has ever done. Its subject matter, to begin with, is most unusual: it is based on a paranormal photograph -- a photograph that may have captured the image of a headless ghost.
  
  Could this ghost have attached itself to Laura's painting? Read her story... and you decide.
  In 1994, James Kidd, a commercial photographer, placed one of his photos on display at a gallery in Tombstone, Arizona where I was showing some of my oil paintings. The photo was the old stagecoach stop at Tombstone.
  He first took a photo of the stagecoach stop and an old stagecoach, and then he didn't wind his camera so he could get a double exposure photo with another old wagon in the foreground.
  When the picture was developed, however, it revealed something unexpected. Standing on a log to the left of the wagon is a figure that the photographer did not see when he took the picture. Upon close inspection, the figure appears to be a headless man! The figure's coat, pants and boots are quite plain and easy to see. But he has no head. The photographer says the photo has been examined by Kodak and other experts to prove that he did not doctor it in any way. [The original photo can be seen at Ghosts of Tombstone .]
  I couldn't get over that photo and asked him if I could do an oil painting of it. (I do most of my paintings from photos I've taken.) He said I could. Back home in Sierra Vista, Arizona, I began work on a 16 x 20-inch oil painting based on the photo.
  When I was about half way through completing the painting, I started getting a strange feeling.
  I began to ask myself: Why on earth did I want to paint this picture? And maybe I should never have started it. But I did finish it. And then some very strange, unexplained things began to happen around my home -- seemingly centered around that painting.
  I do not believe in ghosts , but I cannot for the life of me explain how or why these strange things have happened . I cannot attribute every one of these events directly to the painting, but they have all taken place since it has been in my house -- and are totally unexplained .
  THE HAUNTING BEGINS
  Office havoc. I took the framed painting with some others for a display in a business location. We hung the ghost painting on the wall behind an office desk. Three days later, people from the office called and asked me to come pick up the ghost painting. Every morning, they claimed, the painting was crooked. They would straighten it, and the next morning it would be crooked again. Also, appointments were inexplicably messed up and papers went missing. They were actually afraid of it. I took the painting back.
  Mysterious leak. In 1995, my husband and I moved into a brand new home in Tennessee. We wondered if these ghostly goings-on would stop. But they didn't. Oddly, the roof on the garage of this new home had a leak when it rained. The roofers came out three times to repair it, and although they worked on it they said they could not find the cause of the leak. It didn't make any sense. Nothing they did stopped the darn leak. Finally, my husband asked me where the ghost painting was. It was leaning against the wall between the living room and garage. We moved the painting... and the garage roof never leaked again.
  Next page: The Haunting Intensifies
  Spilled salt. One evening I was preparing dinner. We had an island bar and that is where I set the table. I picked up the salt and pepper shakers, which were two little canning jars with handles, and set them on the bar. I went to the door and called to my husband that dinner was ready. When I got back to the bar, salt was spilled all over it and on the floor. The salt shaker, standing upright, was still where I had set it down.
  We have no animals or children in the house to blame for the spill. It is completely unexplained.
  Telekinetic starfish. My husband and I were sitting in the garage talking to the little neighbor girl who had come over to visit. On the garage wall were three large dried starfish. They were hanging securely on roofing nails.
  The garage door was open, but there was no wind blowing or air movement. Suddenly, the largest starfish came sailing off the wall and landed on the concrete floor. It sailed across the floor about six to seven feet.
  Broken gate. A heavy gate that would have been hard to remove, came off its post for no apparent reason. All the hardware was completely intact.
  The chipped glass. This event really scared me because it could have injured me. We had been doing some yard work and went into the garage to rest where it was cool. My husband said he would mix us some drinks. He returned with the drinks in thick gold-colored glasses with ice cubes. We finished our drinks, and he said he was going to have another and I said I would too.
  So he mixed them in the house and brought them out. I had taken one or two sips from my drink when I looked down to see that a large chunk of glass had been broken off the top of the glass.
  It was perfectly fine the first time I drank from it. Right away I thought my husband had knocked it on something, but he swore he hadn't.
  We looked all over the garage floor for the piece of glass, but found nothing. We went into the house where my husband fixed the drinks and got down on the floor with flashlights and looked. Nothing. I poured the rest of the drink through a strainer to see if the chunk of glass had fallen in, but there was nothing. The missing piece was too large to swallow without me noticing it, but I still had this sick feeling in my stomach. We never found the missing piece of glass.
  The disbeliever. I have always taken photos of the paintings I have done. People ask to see the photos of my paintings and most always say they don't want to touch the photo of the ghost painting. The gals at the beauty shop wanted me to bring my pictures in, and one woman started bragging that she did not believe in ghosts and that it was silly of them to avoid touching the picture. 'Just let me see it,' she said. She took the photo, looked at it closely and just laughed. That night at her house, a clock that had been on the wall for 40 years, fell down and broke into a hundred pieces.
  The hazy figure plays a hand. Our neighbor wanted to show his mother-in-law the photos of my paintings and took them home with him. They left the pictures laying on the table and started playing a three-handed card game in which a dummy hand must be dealt. When they picked up the dummy hand, every card of the dummy hand was in one suit. That scared them to death, he told me. He got up and went outside to move his water sprinkler, and to this day he still swears that he could see a white hazy figure of a person come around the corner. He came running back to my house with the pictures and said he never wanted to touch them again.
  Knock knock. The last thing this ghost did was knock on our front door. My husband and I both heard it at the same time. But our two German Shepherds did not hear the knock. Nobody was at the door.
  Currently, the painting is hanging in our house. A few people have asked to buy the painting, but I am afraid to sell it. What would an unhappy ghost do in their lives?
  I still don't actually believe in ghosts... Yet if I had it to do over, I would not have created this painting.
  Coincidences? Overactive imaginations? Or is it just possible that some unknown energy surrounds the portrait of the headless ghost?
  Anyone want to buy a painting?

"Can You Look Up Driver's License Information Online?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/fl/Can-You-Look-Up-Drivers-License-Information-Online.htm","2016-08-17 03:16:32","  By David Emery
  Now, here's a home page that would seem to confirm everyone's worst fears about the Internet! Billed as the website of the 'National Motor Vehicle License Bureau,' it purports to offer a 'free searchable database of over 121 million U.S. driver's license photos and license information.' How can that be?
  'The United States B.S. amendment to the Freedom of Information Act enacted on Sept. 3rd, 2004 provides public access to motor vehicle driver's information in an electronic format,' the blurb continues. 'Under the Motor Vehicle Operator License Identification Act (MOLIA), all US states are required to adhere to the Driver's B.S. statute and store an electronic copy of all valid drivers licenses in their state...' So, by filling out a simple web-based form, supposedly, any user can search the Bureau's centralized database containing more than 220 million driver's licenses.There's just one slight hitch: it's a joke — it ain't real!
  A reader describes what actually happens when you type in your name and conduct a 'search' on the site:
  The fact is, the so-called 'Motor Vehicle Operator License Identification Act (MOLIA)' doesn't exist. While there are a few bonafide fee-based websites that provide access to driver's license data from states that allow it 'for legitimate purposes,' it's not quite this easy to invade other people's privacy from your  computer.
  Like most popular prank websites, this one succeeds not only because of its slick design and surface plausibility, but because it plays on people's very real fears — in this case, the fear of privacy invasion. Some people have found this site so upsetting that they've written to their Congressmen about it; others are nonplussed and simply forward the URL on to their most gullible friends.
  Does this fake motor vehicle website store visitors' private information or leave cookies on their computers? The source code shows no indication of malicious activity. That could change without notice, however, and there are several other, similar sites out there whose safety is up for grabs, so proper cautionary measures are recommended.
  Big Brother has taken away our privacy. All the world can get your information off your drivers license. Check it out! Check your Driver's License I already removed mine. I suggest you all do the same. Now you can see anyone's Driver's License on the Internet, including your own! I just searched for mine and there it was... picture and all! Thanks Homeland Security! It's unbelievable!!! Just enter your name, city and state to see if yours is on file. After your license comes on the screen, click the box marked 'Please Remove.' This will remove it from public viewing, but not from law enforcement. Please notify all your friends so they can protect themselves too. Believe me they will thank you for it. http://www.license.shorturl.com/

"Did a Study Show that Staring at Breasts Is Good for Men's Health?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/ogling_breasts.htm","2016-01-17 02:33:43","  By David Emery
  'Medical study' supposedly published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims staring at women's breasts every day is good for men's health.
  Description: Satire / Email hoax Circulating since: March / April 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader in April 2000:
  continue reading below our video
  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: Don't get your hopes up, guys. No such study was ever published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( check for yourself ).
  A search of the thousands of peer-reviewed articles contained in the National Institutes of Health medical journal database turns up zero items documenting the health benefits of staring at women's breasts, and, for that matter, zero items authored by 'Dr. Karen Weatherby' (who does not exist, so far as I can tell).
  If the story smacks of supermarket tabloid faux-journalism, well, that's precisely what it is. The text first hit the Internet in March or April 2000, mere weeks after a strikingly similar article appeared in the consistently misinformative Weekly World News (nor is this the first time we've encountered baseless Internet rumors traceable to precisely that source). A slightly different version had already appeared in the May 13, 1997 issue of the tabloid.
  A fresh round of breast-staring mania overtook the Internet in March 2011, when Fox News republished the story before checking the facts.
  It showed up again a few months later on the Scottish news site Daily Record & Sunday Mail : ' Doctors Say Looking at Busty Women for 10 Minutes a Day is Good for Your Health .'
  It goes without saying (I hope) that it's unwise to take medical advice from tabloid 'news' stories, still less from forwarded emails. Males who wish to increase their lifespans ought to consider practicing common sense as an alternative — it's more likely to achieve the desired result than any amount of public breast ogling.
  Admittedly, I don't have any medical research to back that up. Volunteers?

  'MasterCard Wedding' example #1: Email contributed by Dan M., July 14, 2001:
  For anyone who feels they've been invited to too many weddings lately have a laugh. This is actually true. It was in a local newspaper in South Carolina and even Jay Leno mentioned it on the Tonight Show .
  This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.
  After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.
  To thank everyone for coming, bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.
  He said that this was his gift and told everyone to open their envelopes.
  Inside each envelope was an 8x10 photo of his best man having sex... with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding.
  After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, 'F*CK you!' He turned to his bride and said, 'F*CK you!' Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, 'I'm out of here!'
  He had the marriage annulled the first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway, as if nothing was wrong.
  His revenge:
  1) Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guests for a wedding and reception.
  2) Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And, best of all...
  3) Trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends and their entire families.
  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might see one of those MasterCard 'Priceless' commercials out of this? Huh?

  Subject: Revenge
  This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding.

  This guy has balls the size of church bells. This is his world, we just live in it.
  Analysis: This apocryphal tale has undergone some interesting revisions since it first erupted in the summer of 1985. There are two basic versions: one has the bride interrupting the wedding ceremony to reveal that the groom slept with the maid of honor; the other has the groom interrupting to announce that the bride slept with the best man.
  In The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton: 1986), Jan Harold Brunvand reports receiving a flurry of word-of-mouth variants beginning in August 1985, as well as one print version entitled 'The Bothered Bride' by a columnist for the Pioneer Press and Dispatch of St. Paul, Minnesota, and another, 'Bride's Wedding Shocker,' from the tabloid newspaper Weekly World News in December of that same year.
  The story continued to circulate on into the '90s, meriting a write-up by Chicago Tribune reporter Cheryl Lavin (correctly pegging the tale as an urban legend) in November 1990 and turning up on Internet message boards in early 1995 as a ' true story ' that happened at Clemson University. The main difference between the Internet version and previous tellings is the groom's alleged use of photographs of the bride and best man caught in flagrante delicto to inform the wedding guests of their indiscretion. An extended version dating from 2001 features the 'Priceless' tag line from the well-known series of MasterCard TV commercials and continues to circulate to this day. The story is now popularly known as 'MasterCard Wedding.'
  Also known as: 'Clemson Wedding' or 'Wedding Revenge.'

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: Most of us wish we had the gumption to emulate the example above and, just once, tell the unvarnished truth on a stupid job application. Ironically, 'most of us' includes the man who came up with the idea, Greg Bulmash, who wrote this piece as a joke in April 1997 and says he never submitted it, or intended to submit it, to an actual employer. To the contrary, he posted it on his humor website , from which it was copied and shared under a new preamble which claimed, 'This is an actual job application someone submitted at a McDonald's fast-food establishment — AND THEY HIRED HIM!'
  Gone was Mr. Bulmash's more prosaic but honest introduction: 'As I was working on re-spinning my resume this past week, I realized that we're never quite truthful on resumes and job applications. We try to make ourselves look as good as possible, usually better than we really are. So today, I thought I'd fill out a job application the way I want to rather than the way I should.'
  Circa 2000, a new version appeared in the wild which listed the purported job applicant's age as 17. A 2003 variant claimed the application was submitted to the manager of a Walmart store by a '75-year-old senior.' It has circulated in one form or another ever since, and was commemorated with a press release on the 10th anniversary of its original publishing date.
  'And how has being a living legend, albeit an urban legend, affected Greg Bulmash's career?' begins the closing paragraph of the 2007 press release. ''No fame or fortune from it... yet,' he chuckles. 'I have had a few fast food restaurant managers tell me they would have hired me if I submitted it at their stores. If things get tight, I'll have to keep that in mind.''
  Bulmash's spoof is reminiscent of another internet classic, Hugh Gallagher's ridiculously overblown college application essay , originally written in 1990 and still making the rounds today.

"Is This "Suggestive" Mickey Mouse Milk Ad Real?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humo1/ss/Mickey-Mouse-Milk-Ad.htm","2016-03-03 13:46:56","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: 2011 (or earlier) Status: Fake
  Analysis: This image has been circulating for several years and crops up frequently on sites like Pinterest and Reddit. The earliest post I've found is a Sept. 29, 2011 entry on Boing Boing describing the pictured advertisement as 'a relic of olde-world naiveté.'
  The ad copy reads as follows:
  'Outside of you, Mickey — that milk is the best thing in the world!' enthuses a grinning Minnie Mouse while pointing to a giant bottle of Grand Rapids Creamery milk.
  'INSIDE of you, Minnie,' Mickey Mouse responds, 'my milk is the best thing in the world!'
  It's not wholly implausible that such a risqué ad, whether intentionally suggestive or not, could have been published in some more naive era — say, the 1930s — nor that the innuendo that makes it so funny to us now could have gone right over the heads of its intended audience. We've seen examples of this before .
  Moreover, a milk company called Grand Rapids Creamery really did exist, and published a monthly promotional comic book during the mid-1930s using Disney characters to advertise its products. An ad almost identical to the one pictured above appeared in the June 1934 issue of Grand Rapids Creamery's Mickey Mouse Magazine , but here's the thing. In the original ad copy Mickey Mouse didn't say, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, my milk is the best thing in the world!' What he actually said, more accurately mirroring Minnie's words, was, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, that milk is the best thing in the world!'
  In short, the text in the viral version has been altered to yield a verbal double entendre that didn't exist in the original. Don't feel bad if you were fooled by it. So was BuzzFeed writer Brian Galindo , not to mention E! Online correspondent John Boone , who wrote: 'Maybe it's just an innocent little double entendre that the ad agency thought was clever and — wink wink — a little bit naughty, do you get it?' The Photoshop job was so convincing that it was included in a Nov. 21, 2012 Cracked.com feature, ' 6 Retro Ads With Accidental Sexual Innuendos .'
  Turns out it was an example of new world, not 'olde world,' naiveté.
  The Walt Disney Company, Disneyland and Disney cartoon characters have been the subjects of many urban legends and online hoaxes over the years. One recent hoax falsely claimed that Harry Potter actress Emma Watson is set to star in a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid . Another used doctored images to demonstrate an ' amazing likeness ' between photos of Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding to Disney's 1950 animated classic, Cinderella . And then, of course, there's the classic urban legend claiming that when Walt Disney died in 1966 his body was cryogenically frozen and preserved for future revival at a secret location in Disneyland. Not true. His body was cremated, in accordance with his wishes.

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  Analysis: This droll narrative was conceived as a satire and never intended to fool anyone — though alas, it has. Not long after it began making the Internet rounds during the mid-1990s, someone added a preamble claiming the correspondence is authentic and the events described completely true. Neither, of course, is the case. The putative sender, one Harvey Rowe, is a real person , though he is not a curator of antiquities, nor has he ever worked for the Smithsonian Institution. By his own admission he is the clever bugger who made up this tall tale, however. Now living in Arizona and employed in medical informatics, Dr. Rowe was a graduate student in South Carolina in 1994 when he first typed up the letter and emailed it to a few friends strictly for their amusement. One or more of those early recipients sent it on to their friends, who forwarded it on to theirs, etc., etc., and in short order Harvey Rowe's 'totally fabricated' story had taken on a life of its own.
  'It seems to have achieved critical mass [in 1995] and there was some evidence people were taking it seriously, despite the many hints that it was written with humorous intent,' Rowe marveled in a 1998 interview with writer E.M. Ganin. 'Shortly after that I did a search on my name and found it on about 100 websites, which surprised the hell out of me.'
  When last I checked, that number was in the thousands.

"How Bill Murray Became A Web Legend Without Even Trying","http://humor.about.com/od/bestofthebest/a/Bill-Murray-Effortless-Internet-Icon.htm","2016-08-31 15:41:27","  By Beverly Jenkins
  Bill Murray has been making us laugh since his Saturday Night Live days in 1975. His career has been long and successful, and in recent years he has managed to appeal to a whole new (younger) audience by becoming a big deal on the internet. What's interesting is not just that he doesn't care about his internet fame (he genuinely couldn't give a you-know-what), but that he hasn't done a single thing to court it. He doesn't even have an official Twitter or Facebook page, yet he has remained not only relevant in today’s web-centric world, but he has gained even MORE popularity among young people. HOW?
  Step One: Be Yourself.
  Here's the thing: by all accounts Bill Murray is naturally a pretty regular guy, and he refuses to operate like your typical Hollywood actor . He's hard to get a hold of; he doesn't have an agent, an assistant, or a manager. If you want Bill to be in your movie, you must call his 1-800 phone number and leave a message. Yes, really .
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  Maybe he'll listen to your message, maybe he won't. If he's interested, he'll give you a call back. This method can cause the occasional bit of confusion. Bill famously misunderstood one movie premise and ended up signing on to be the voice of Garfield the cat , for instance. Twice .
  Step Two: Be Awesome To Fans.
  Bill Murray internet lore is full of stories where he pops up at a random places and acts like everybody's BFF. He once crashed a bachelor party and gave a moving speech about finding true love. He crashed a wedding and once hosted an epic Christmas party featuring a vodka ice luge. He even showed up in a New York City park to play some kickball with random people. He has been spotted jumping behind the bar in Austin, TX to pour drinks for the locals. He escorted a young woman to a dance in Scotland. He has been busted driving golf carts pretty much everywhere.
  ”Nobody's Going To Believe You.”
  There are so many Bill Murray fan encounters circulating online that it’s impossible to tell which are real and which are fake. One of the most famous encounters has been an internet staple for a few years and is roundly believed to be fact. A young man claims that he was eating in a Wendy’s restaurant when Murray walked over to him, took a fry from his tray, and said to him, “Nobody's going to believe you.” He then walked away as if nothing had happened. Inspired by this story, there is a whole website devoted to similar Murray run-ins, though many of the tales on Bill Murray Stories are wishful fan fabrications.
  Step Three: Don't Be Mainstream.
  In 2012 a fake (but convincing) Bill Murray parody account popped up on Twitter. Overnight, more than 150,000 people followed the account before it was revealed to be a fraud. When Twitter deleted the page, fans were really upset to learn that they did not, in fact, have a new way to correspond with the Ghostbusters and Caddyshack celeb who has starred in some of our favorite funny movies of the past few decades.
  The fact of the matter is, Bill doesn't want or need social media attention. It just doesn't matter to him. Take that, Kardashians (and every other celebrity )!
  Step Four: Don't Try Too Hard. Or, You Know, At All. Don't Try At All.
  Bill Murray proves that sometimes being awesome is enough. Instead of tweeting his every thought, he simply shows up and interacts with his fans wherever he happens to be that day . He just does what he wants to do, when he wants to do it. He's having fun, and shouldn't the internet be fun? Of course it should.
  Bill Murray has always been cool, but now that he’s a web phenomenon without even trying to be, he has moved beyond “awesome” to living legend status.

"Phil Mickelson's Gambling Debts","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/mickelson_debt.htm","2015-11-30 05:39:27","  By David Emery
  Netlore Archive: Did pro golfer Phil Mickelson really rack up a $200,000 gambling debt betting on his own performance in a practice round against three other players in Augusta, Georgia?
  Description: Internet hoax / April Fools joke Circulating since: April 2008 Status: False
  Example: Email contributed by a reader, April 9, 2008:
  MICKELSON'S GAMBLING DEBTS CAUSE UPROAR AMONG AUGUSTA MEMBERS
  Last week Phil Mickelson was playing a practice round at Augusta and went away from protocol and convinced his playing partners to up the stakes in the usual $1 game. It was Mickelson versus the other three which included some of the deepest pockets among the membership. The stakes: $5000 skins and a pot of $130,000, $100,000 of which was contributed by Mickelson for the low net score - Mickelson would play off scratch.
  According to one of the threesome which obviously will remain anonymous, 'everything was going great until the back 9 when Mickelson really could not believe the good fortune of 'chuckie'. He was draining everything on the greens and when he missed the green twice he had two chip-ins. Phil's lead on the scorecard looked safe but in the clubhouse we added it up and lo and behold, Phil owed $200,000.' And then it got ugly. The stories by witnesses conflict, but in effect Mickelson tried to pass the bets off as laugh on the first tee and insisted 'there was no way he would bet hundreds of thousands on golf.' Mickelson believed the standard one dollar game was in effect.
  The threesome was having none of it and before you know it the foursome was sitting in the office of Billy Payne who was none too happy about the loud conversations taking place in the dining room. But even in the privacy of the office, Mickelson was being very difficult. According to the same anonymous member: 'Phil slipped up and admitted that he initiated the stakes and set the terms of the bet. Then he protested at having to pay so much and offered 30 cents on the dollar right then and there, take it or leave it. Billy was aghast and told Phil, you will arrange to pay every dollar or you will never be welcome at Augusta again, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. Mickelson tried to protest and even made a snide remark that Billy couldn't stop him from being welcome at Augusta every April. Billy simply asked are you taking it or leaving it.'
  Mickelson later called his accountant with the banking details of 'chuckie' and an arrangement was made for a wire transfer of an undisclosed amount. The worse of this may not be over as the other member of the threesome was upset enough to call the PGA Tour. When contacted for a comment, the PGA Tour declined to comment and would not even acknowledge whether or not they have been contacted about the conflict at Augusta National.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Analysis: Tales of golfers' gambling exploits are legion, and PGA pro Phil Mickelson has a more storied reputation than most. 'Mickelson is ... known as a player who seldom — if ever — backs off from a challenge,' wrote the late Don Wade in Wanna Bet? The Greatest True Stories About Gambling on Golf , 'and that includes a bet.' Wade recounted a 1998 incident in which Mickelson and his partner John Huston laid a side-bet against their opponents in a practice round on who could score the most birdies. Mickelson and Huston walked away with $27,000.
  That said, as always, it's our task to differentiate between the legendary and the just plain false, and the story before us, in which Mickelson supposedly racked up a $200,000 debt during a 2008 practice round in Augusta, Georgia, is the latter — just plain false. It was an April Fools' Day joke, in fact, concocted by person(s) unknown and distributed on the Internet with a bogus attribution to ' GolfWeek Insider.'
  'Not true,' responded Golfweek editor Jeff Babineau in an April 9 posting on the Golfweek Tour Blog. 'As the editor of Golfweek , I can assure that nobody at our magazine or website had anything to do with the ruse, which was posted, go figure, on April 1.'

"The Doppelganger Haunting","http://paranormal.about.com/od/Doppelgangers/a/The-Doppelganger-Haunting.htm","2015-10-23 10:49:33","  Was it a doppelganger ... or a ghost ? What was the entity that appeared repeatedly to Jordan, her mother, and her sister that took on the physical characteristics of her sister - even her clothing - yet would not allow its face to be seen? And what would happen if her sister did see its face? These experiences have the confusing elements of doppelganger sightings with the unnerving spookiness of a haunting. This is Jordan's story...
  
  THIS HAS BEEN an ongoing experience for my mother, sister, and me. We have all seen this 'thing,' and the only way we can explain it is that it's my sister's doppelganger. Not many people look like my sister. She has very long red hair, so it's not hard to miss her and you can't mistake her for someone else.
  FIRST SIGHTING
  This all started in the Fall of 2004 when I was in sixth grade in Oviedo, Florida. I was in my room trying to fall asleep when my door opened and my sister came in -- or what I thought was my sister. I didn't have a nightstand at the time, so I just used a picnic cooler with a blanket over it. It had my alarm clock and some hair brushes on it. My 'sister' came over and was messing with my brushes, which I remember really made me mad because it was late and I was trying to sleep.
  I began yelling at her to get out of my room. She didn't say a word, but just abruptly turned and left. As I watched her leave, it seemed to me that she was walking funny. She walked at a very fast pace with her head turned and hair over her face, hiding her eyes and mouth.
  The next day, I confronted my sister about coming into my room in the middle of the night. She swore - in fact, still swears to this day - that she was not in my room and had no idea what I was talking about.
  MOM'S SIGHTING
  That was my first experience with her doppelganger. My mom and even my sister have seen it, too.
  One day about a year after my experience, my mom was at home while my sister and I were at school. We were old enough to wake up and get ourselves ready and make it to the bus stop without any help from our parents. My sister would wake up earlier than anyone since her school started at 7:20 a.m.
  From my understanding, she did in fact make it to school on time. Yet my mom swears up and down that she saw my sister walking around the house with a towel on her head, like she just got out of the shower. My mom was so mad that my sister missed the bus to school, she started yelling at her. Again, just as in my experience, this 'person' was walking in a fast-paced manner, my mother said, and she never saw her face. She was walking so fast, but my mom kept yelling at her, thinking she was going to have to drive my sister to school. When my mom followed her into the other room, however, there was no one there.
  When my sister came home after school and my mom told her what happened, my sister was puzzled because she really was at school. My mom thought she was losing her mind. I don't believe I told my mom about my experience until after she saw it, too. We both came to the conclusion that there had to be something wrong with its face, and that's why it never let us see it.
  I believe there is something dead wrong with its eyes, but that's just my theory. We never felt threatened by it because at the time we really thought it was my sister.
  Next page: The Doppelganger finds her
  THE DOPPELGANGER FOUND HER
  There was one time my sister saw this entity for herself, and I must say her experience was a little different. She was working as a shift manager at Pizza Hut. She was at the restaurant pretty early in the morning before all the other workers got there. She saw someone walking in the kitchen area. This person had long red hair, just like her, and was also dressed in a Pizza Hut uniform, just like she was.
  My sister said a feeling of dread came over her and she was really scared. She actually had to leave the building and wait for another employee to show up. She was certain that it wasn't another employee she saw, since she was the only one with red hair. She also confirmed that the doppelganger moved fast and its face couldn't be seen.
  It really scared her to think that her doppelganger had finally found her and followed her.
  My sister firmly believes that if she looks the doppelganger in the face that she will somehow die. That's just the feeling she gets from it, and that's why it scared her to know that it followed her to work.
  That was the last time any of us saw the thing... for a while. We didn't forget about it, but I guess we all thought maybe it couldn't find us anymore. But we were wrong.
  SIGHTINGS CONTINUE
  The most recent event happened last year. My sister and I are all grown up now; she's 26 and I'm 20 now, and we have since moved away from Florida. My mom and sister live in Kentucky on the same property and I live in New York.
  It was a typical day for my mom. She was by the sink doing some dishes in her home. There is a window right above the sink, and when she looked out of it she saw ' my sister ' walking up the path to the front door wearing her work uniform. She expected to see my sister come through the door to finish getting ready for work, but she never came inside the house.
  An hour later, my real sister did arrive at my mom's house. She was still in her pajamas, so my mom questioned her about what happened earlier. Like so many times before, my sister denied walking over there and told my mom she was still sleeping at the time this happened. She wasn't needed at work until a few hours later, so there was no reason for her to be in her uniform.
  They were both freaked out by this latest incident. We all thought the doppelganger had left since it had been years since anyone saw it, but somehow it found my sister again.
  I really don't know how to explain all of these events, and I'm not sure if it will ever leave my sister alone. I don't know what will happen if she looks this entity in the face, if anything, but I hope she never does. For now, though, it's been a while since any one of us have seen it... but that doesn't mean it isn't out there.

  Example: Email text contributed by Craig S., Aug. 20, 2001:
  ARKANSAS CITY (AP) -- A Little Rock woman was killed yesterday after leaping through her moving car's sun roof during an incident best described as 'a mistaken rapture' by dozens of eye witnesses. Thirteen other people were injured after a twenty-car pile up resulted from people trying to avoid hitting the woman who was apparently convinced that the rapture was occurring when she saw twelve people floating up into the air, and then passed a man on the side of the road who she claimed was Jesus.
  'She started screaming 'He's back, He's back' and climbed right out of the sunroof and jumped off the roof of the car,' said Everet Williams, husband of 28-year-old Georgann Williams who was pronounced dead at the scene. 'I was slowing down but she wouldn't wait till I stopped,' Williams said. She thought the rapture was happening and was convinced that Jesus was gonna lift her up into the sky,' he went on to say.
  'This is the strangest thing I've seen since I've been on the force,'said Paul Madison, first officer on the scene. Madison questioned the man who looked like Jesus and discovered that he was dressed up as Jesus and was on his way to a toga costume party when the tarp covering the bed of his pickup truck came loose and released twelve blowup dolls filled with helium which floated up into the air.
  Ernie Jenkins, 32, of Fort Smith, who's been told by several of his friends that he looks like Jesus, pulled over and lifted his arms into the air in frustration, and said 'Come back here,' just as the Williams' car passed him.
  Mrs. Williams was sure that it was Jesus lifting people up into the sky as they passed by him, according to her husband, who says his wife loved Jesus more than anything else.
  When asked for comments about the twelve dolls, Jenkins replied 'This is all just too weird for me. I never expected anything like this to happen.'
  
  Willis says he went out of his way to attribute the story to the nonexistent 'EAP' news service so as not to deceive anyone, but as you can see in the above variant, at least one anonymous emailer has changed it to read 'AP' (Associated Press) to lend it an air of authenticity. Judging from the quizzical mail I've received so far, some people truly aren't sure whether to believe it or not.
  For future reference, most theologians are rather firmly convinced that if and when Jesus does return, he's not likely to be driving a pickup truck.

"Mel Gibson: The Real Life "Man Without a Face?"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humor/fl/Probably-Wasnt-the-Same-Elephant.htm","2016-08-16 19:20:44","  By David Emery
  In this common urban legend, a tale of great courage and inspiration, a young man manages to overcome the odds despite a physical handicap.
  The legend is usually shared via email, with something like the below:
  Subject: True Story
  Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully)
  Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even a stagehand gig came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered  the worse section of town.
  Walking home from work one evening, this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money, the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp. They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road, they assumed he was dead and called the morgue.
  On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all his teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared, he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired.
  When the young man started to look for work again, he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as 'The Man Who Had No Face'. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years.
  One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church, he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life.
  The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.
  The priest, through his personal contacts, was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worst, was filled with good humor and love.
  The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly.
  The young man is Mel Gibson.
  His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie The Man Without A Face . He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.'
  While Mel Gibson certainly has had an interesting life, it is not the stuff of which high drama is made. Born in 1956 in Peekskill, New York, he moved to Australia with his family at the age of 12, but the young man was a loner and a heavy drinker with no particular direction in life.
  It was his older sister, Mary, who set Gibson's future career in motion by submitting an application in his name — and without his knowledge — to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney. Having nothing to lose, he auditioned and was accepted. He proved to be a talented actor and lived theatrically ever after.
  His first big break in the movies occurred in 1979 when he landed the starring role in a low-budget Australian flick called 'Mad Max,' which soon attracted a cult following. There's an anecdote surrounding this early triumph which presumably inspired our apocryphal email story.
  About a week before the big audition, he got drunk at a party and wound up in a fistfight with three other men. And lost. 'I woke up in the bloody hospital with head stitches, a busted nose, my jaw off the hook, peeing blood,' he recalled in a 1995 Playboy interview. He was 'still a mess' on the day of the audition, but ironically it was his busted-up face that caught director George Miller's attention and won Gibson the part as the film's post-apocalyptic antihero.
  Be that as it may, he did not require a year in the hospital to recover, nor was he left permanently disfigured, nor did he join a circus freak show and spend five years wandering and horribly depressed. On the contrary, he healed quickly, shot Mad Max that same year and went on to become one of the world's most sought-after leading men.
  He did, in fact, later direct and star in The Man Without a Face , the 1993 film adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. In it, he played a reclusive teacher whose face had been horribly scarred as a result of an automobile accident. But the script wasn't based on Gibson's own life, not even remotely. As a matter of fact, the novel from which the film was adapted was first published in 1972.
  Mel Gibson was 16 years old at the time.

  As told by reader Allison Falk...
  I heard this story from a good friend of 11 years. It supposedly happened to her aunt's coworker. I believed it until I saw the same story circulating via email on two separate occasions (hmm...).
  Here it is:
  A woman is driving down the highway. The highway was originally in New York, but in the retellings I read both took place in Pennsylvania. The woman notices a police car behind her with his lights on and she starts to get nervous, planning what she will say when the officer pulls her over. The officer approaches her vehicle and before he demands her license and registration, she chimes in, 'I know! You pulled me over to invite me to the policeman's ball!'
  To which he replies, 'I'm a state trooper, ma'am. We don't have balls.'
  Upon realizing what he has said, he clears his throat, tips his hat and walks back to his car.
  Analysis: Compare the above to this variant of the same 'sex-word-error story' recorded more than 30 years ago in The Choking Doberman by Jan Harold Brunvand (WW Norton, 1984):

  Synopsis: Man arrives at hospital with scrotum swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit. The doctors examining him find he has one testicle missing and a gaping wound that appears to be held together by staples. Then he tells them his story...
  Description: Viral story Circulating since: 1991 Status: True
  Example:
  When a 40-year old man arrived at a hospital asking to see a doctor specializing in 'men's troubles', he was shown to a cubicle. There, he gingerly unwrapped three yards of foul smelling, stained gauze from around his scrotum, which had swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit.
  On further inspection, it was discovered that his left testicle was missing completely and, embedded within the swollen, tender and weeping wound, were a number of dark objects which the patient confessed were one inch staple nails from an industrial staple gun.
  It transpired that the man spent lunchtimes alone in the workshop, where he regularly enjoyed the sexual thrill of placing his penis on the moving canvas fan belt of a piece of machinery. One day, the excitement had caused him to lose his concentration and the fan-belt had snatched his scrotum into the fly-wheel, throwing him several feet across the floor and removing his left testicle. Rather than go to hospital, he self-administered first aid using a staple gun and then continued work when his colleagues returned. It was two weeks before he got around to visiting the hospital.

  Analysis: It's tempting to dismiss this grisly story as a prurient joke, but we have it on good authority — that of attending physician Dr. William A. Morton, Jr., who penned a now-famous journal article on the case in 1991 — that the incident really happened. David Herzog, a reporter for the Allentown Morning Call , confirmed the details of the case with Morton in 1992. Morton's article, a dubious claim to fame if there ever was one, originally appeared in the journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality .
  The text of that article has circulated via fax, forwarded email and social media ever since, spawning a great many shorter, less accurate versions of the story (such as the one above) in the process. It's irresistable, let's face it.
  Thanks to the Internet, 'Scrotum Self-Repair' has enjoyed such a wide distribution that folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand saw fit to include it in his 1999 omnibus of urban legends Too Good to Be True , citing word-of-mouth variations (e.g., 'the scrotum is said to have swollen to the size of a basketball') that have spun off from Dr. Morton's original published text. Interestingly, many of those spoken-word variants had been conveyed by doctors and medical students who had themselves heard them on the job. For such a science-based calling, the medical profession is a hotbed of urban legendry.
  Probably the main reason the story captures people's imaginations so is that it revolves around what is essentially an act of masturbation — and no ordinary act of masturbation, at that. So, it's a cautionary tale , of sorts, though I doubt very many people need to be instructed or reminded not to perform sexual acts on themselves (or on anyone else) in close proximity to power tools.
  Among the most frequently asked questions about urban legends is whether they ever turn out to be true. Well, here you go. I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a better affirmative example than this.

  IN A probing article headlined 'Everything but the Gerbil,' Nerve.com writer Leif 'Trials of a Gay-Seeming Straight Male' Ueland surveys the current medical literature on RFOs — Rectal Foreign Objects. Forget the urban legends you've heard about rodent-stuffing celebrities . Far more interesting — even if they're 'as unbelievable as folklore' in some instances — are the documented reports of actual objects extracted from patients' rectums by emergency room physicians (an oven mitt , for crying out loud?).
  The whole topic is apt to evoke titters from lay readers, but, as Ueland soberly reminds us, it is no laughing matter to the doctors charged with repairing the often serious tissue damage that can result from such activities. And such activities, by all accounts, are on the increase.
  'Ludicrous as it seems,' Ueland concludes, 'the time may have come to confront the culture's love of placing things up their behinds and raise public awareness of the practice's inherent dangers.'

  Introduction
  IF NOTHING else, the interminable U.S. presidential election of 2000 yielded inspirational fodder for humorists everywhere, and not just those fortunate enough to host late-night talk shows or write syndicated newspaper columns. To date, some of the funniest jabs at America's electoral follies have come not from the likes of Dave Letterman and Dave Barry, but from ordinary folks creatively venting their frustration via that quintessentially populist medium known as the Internet.
  Thanks to email, blogs and message boards, homespun humorists can now command ad hoc audiences numbering in the millions. If, as they say, laughter is the best medicine, then this is a wholesome cultural development. Comedy is too important to be left to the professionals.
  Notice of Revocation of Independence
  One of the cleverest bits to flood the email circuit in November 2000 was the 'Notice of Revocation of Independence,' a sarcastic proclamation reasserting Great Britain's sovereignty over the U.S. due to the latter's evident inability to govern itself ( full text ).

"The Stolen Penguin","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalsinsects/a/penguin.htm","2016-01-17 21:22:42","  By David Emery
  In an unusual press conference held at Boston's New England Aquarium in late 2005, officials sought to reassure the public that all of the institution's 61 penguins were present and accounted for, notwithstanding a persistent rumors to the effect that a 12-year-old autistic boy had made off with one of the flightless birds in his backpack.
  Aquarium spokesman Tony Lacasse, who said in a press conference that he has received hundreds of emails and phone calls about the alleged penguin theft from around the country, labeled the tale a '100 percent certifiable urban legend.'
  As the story goes, the boy had gotten lost while visiting the penguin habitat with his mother and seemed quite agitated when she found him, so she took him home and drew a warm bath to calm him down. Awhile later, when she heard loud splashing noises coming from the bathroom, she went in to check and found her son in the company of a full-grown penguin.  He admitted sneaking the bird home in his backpack.

  Highest Paid Male Actors Ever
  Stolen penguin tale is at least a decade old
  Not possible, says Lacasse, who notes that the penguin pool is six feet deep and the slippery birds 'fly' through the water at astonishing speeds. What's more, penguins are wild animals with beaks as sharp as razors. It would be hard enough for an adult to heft one out of the pool, let alone a 12-year-old child.
  Though brand new to the Boston Aquarium, the story is at least a decade old and appears to have originated in the Republic of Ireland.  A typical variant, circulating on the Internet since 2003, goes like this:
  A friend's family had spent the day at Dublin Zoo, a very successful day right up until the end of the picnic lunch when they realised their six-year-old son was missing. Along, it should be noted, with his lunchbox and rucksack. Much frantic searching eventually revealed the youngster, dirty and disheveled but otherwise apparently okay, round the back of the penguin enclosure. The errant son was in big trouble and the day out ended there. He said nothing all the way home, sitting apparently full of remorse, in the very back of the people carrier, curled up with his coat and rucksack. When they arrived home he ran straight upstairs for a bath without any bidding at all. He clearly knew he was in very big trouble.
  He stayed in the bathroom for over an hour before his mother decided his verbal assurances were not enough. She opened the door to the sight of her beloved son sharing his bath with a small but perfectly formed and very, very real penguin.
  Yep, her son had kidnapped a baby penguin and smuggled it back home in his rucksack. The zoo, it has to be said, were not amused and called the police. However, after much argument and a character reference from the boy's form teacher no charges were pressed. But the family were warned never to return to the zoo.
  It has been theorized, probably correctly, that the sudden resurgence of the urban legend stateside was inspired by the November 2005 release of the popular documentary March of the Penguins on DVD.
  2006 Update:
  In November 2006, the story erupted again in Boston and St. Louis, apparently inspired by the release of Happy Feet , an animated film featuring singing and dancing penguins.

  In which we are told, and with a straight face, that the word 'sh*t' originated as the acronym of 'Ship High in Transit' (or 'Stow High in Transit'), a supposed nautical phrase.
  Description: Folk etymology Circulating since: 1999? Status: False (details below)
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, March 27, 2013:
  Manure... An interesting fact
  Manure: In the 16th and 17th centuries, everything had to be Transported by ship and it was also before the invention of commercial Fertilizers, so large shipments of manure were quite common. It was shipped dry, because in dry form it weighed a lot less than when Wet, but once water (at sea) hit it, not only did it become heavier, But the process of fermentation began again, of which a byproduct is Methane gas of course. As the stuff was stored below decks in bundles You can see what could (and did) happen. Methane began to build up below decks and the first time someone came Below at night with a lantern, BOOOOM! Several ships were destroyed in this manner before it was determined Just what was happening
  After that, the bundles of manure were always stamped with the Instruction ' Stow high in transit ' on them, which meant for the Sailors to stow it high enough off the lower decks so that any water That came into the hold would not touch this volatile cargo and start The production of methane.
  Thus evolved the term ' S.H.I.T ' , (Stow High In Transit) which has Come down through the centuries and is in use to this very day. You probably did not know the true history of this word. Neither did I. I had always thought it was a golf term.

  Example #2: From a Usenet posting dated April 12, 1999:
  Subject: origin of sh*t
  In the 1800's, cow pie's were collected on the prarie and boxed and loaded on steam ships to burn instead of wood. Wood was not only hard to find, but heavy to move around and store.
  When the boxes of cow pie's were in the sun for days on board the ships, they would smell bad. So when the manure was boxed up, they stamped the outside of the box, S.H.I.T....which means Ship High In Transit.
  When people came aboard the ship and said,'Oh what is that smell!' They were told it was sh*t.
  That is where the saying came from...It smells like sh*t! :-)
  Analysis: Clever as all that may be, whoever came up with it doesn't know sh*t about 'sh*t.'
  According to my dictionary, the word is much older than the 1800s, appearing in its earliest form about 1,000 years ago as the Old English verb scitan . That is confirmed by lexicographer Hugh Rawson in his bawdily edifying book, Wicked Words (New York: Crown, 1989), where it is further noted that the expletive is distantly related to words like science , schedule and shield , all of which derive from the Indo-European root skei- , meaning 'to cut' or 'to split.' You get the idea.
  For most of its history 'sh*t' was spelled 'sh*te' (and sometimes still is), but the modern, four-letter spelling of the word can be found in texts dating as far back as the mid-1700s. It most certainly did not originate as an acronym invented by 19th-century sailors.
  Apropos that false premise, Rawson observes that 'sh*t' has long been the subject of naughty wordplay, very often based on made-up acronyms on the order of 'Ship High in Transit.' For example:
  Lastly, all these stories are reminiscent of another popular specimen of folk etymology claiming that the f-word (another good old-fashioned, all-purpose, four-letter expletive) originated as the acronym of 'Fornication Under Consent of the King' (or, in another version, 'For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge').
  Suffice it to say, it's all C.R.A.P.

  Synopsis: The viral text quoted below purports to share instructions from a U.S. government Peace Corps manual on what to do if an anaconda or python attacks you in the wild. My advice? Think twice before following this advice.
  Description: Viral joke Circulating since: 1998? Status: False (details below)
  Example:
  Anaconda Attack
  The following is from the US Government Peace Corps Manual for its volunteers who work in the Amazon Jungle. It tells what to do in case an anaconda attacks you.
  1. If you are attacked by an anaconda do not run. The snake is faster than you are.
  2. Lie flat on the ground. Put your arms tight against your sides, your legs tight against one another.
  3. Tuck your chin in.
  4. The snake will come and begin to nudge and climb over your body.
  5. Do not panic.
  6. After the snake has examined you, it will begin to swallow you from the feet and always from the end. Permit the snake to swallow your feet and ankles. Do not panic.
  7. The snake will now begin to suck your legs into its body. You must lie perfectly still. This will take a long time.
  8. When the snake has reached your knees slowly and with as little movement as possible, reach down, take your knife and very gently slide it into the side of the snake's mouth between the edge of its mouth and your leg, then suddenly rip upwards, severing the snake's head.
  9. Be sure you have your knife.
  10. Be sure your knife is sharp.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: I'm informed that really large snakes such as anacondas and pythons typically throttle their prey to death (or at least to unconsciousness) before swallowing it head (not feet) first, so one might do well to seek snake attack survival guidance from a more reputable source.
  In point of fact, the above text, which has circulated online in more or less this form since 1998 , is an obvious spoof. It was never, so far as I've been able to determine, published in any Peace Corps instruction manual. Its true origin remains unknown. One participant in a message board discussion claimed to have read it in Mad magazine some years ago, but I haven't been able to verify that.
  Internet and tabloid lore notwithstanding, snakes have rarely, if ever, been known to swallow full-grown human beings.

It was June, 2007. It was already 10:00 p.m.; I know because the kids were supposed to be in bed at 9:30, so I got them all ready for bed, and off they went. I sat around for a while, made a snack, and went to the computer room to waste some time, since I wasn't tired yet.
  I decided to call a friend, since I was feeling uneasy about being up alone in Kathy's house (the nearest neighbor was quite a way across a field) and it was so quiet after the kids were asleep. I was talking on the phone to my friend. It made me forget about the uneasy feeling I had earlier. I decided to go outside for a cigarette.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  I finished my cigarette and let my friend go. I wanted to do some things around the house. As I was walking inside, I noticed the front door across the living room was wide open. No one ever uses the front door. It was even taped shut -- summer in the country, in Manitoba, is the worst for mosquitoes.
  I walked fast to go close it. I even put a small table in front of it so it wouldn't open again. I checked the kids quickly; they were all sound asleep. Feeling very creeped out, I proceeded to go to the computer room to get my mind off what happened. As I was sitting there, I heard a knock at the window. There were blinds on it, so I couldn't see out. I got up and walked to the living room, pretending I didn't hear it.
  Suddenly, I heard knocking at the front window, then the kitchen window, then all the windows at the same time. It got louder and louder. I flipped! I know this part is really cliché but, I grabbed a knife and the phone and ran and sat with my back against the back door, where there were no windows. Then I heard a scratch that started at the top of the door all the way to the bottom.
  As it got to the back of my head, I started to cry. I quickly called my friend back and told him everything. His only advice was to tell me to call someone to pick me up, which was not a possibility, since I didn't know anyone in Lil Sask (as we call it) and that there were six kids sleeping in the bedroom. I calmed down enough to get off the phone, and made a bed in the living room with the lights on and I fell asleep.
  In the morning, I took a walk outside to look around. There was no evidence of any being here, no footprints, nothing. I didn't tell Kathy what happened. I just wanted to go home and get away from there. I told my mom a few days later; she then told Kathy, of course. Kathy admitted that before when her sister was sleeping over on the couch, that she awoke to a little girl -- with no face! -- standing in front of her. After that, no amount of money would make me babysit for Kathy overnight again.

"The Uses and Abuses of Superglue","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/business/a/superglue.htm","2014-07-19 15:14:49","  I found this posted online, original source unknown:
  Fact or fiction?  It's hard to say for sure, but the fact that the selfsame item has been posted and reposted on the Internet as 'fresh news' for 15 years running casts a smidgen of doubt on its authenticity.
  Befitting its status as a modern miracle invention, superglue looms large in urban legendry. In its purest form the stuff can withstand a ton of pressure on a one-square-inch bond. It sets in seconds and can be used to stick anything to just about anything else, permanently. Since its discovery 60-odd years ago, the ultra-sticky substance known to consumers as Super Glue, Krazy Glue, Permabond and Kola Loka has inspired a plethora of folktales which generally fall into one of three categories: Origins, Mishaps and Pranks.
  Superglue origins
  The following was culled from a message board posting:
  Not quite. Although superglue has been used with great success in place of sutures for certain medical procedures, the oft-made claim that it was originally invented for this purpose is false.
  In fact, superglue (known to chemists as cyanoacrylate ) was invented quite by accident. Twice. In both cases, scientists were hoping to come up with new plastic compounds for use in applications such as gun sights and jet canopies but happened unexpectedly upon a formulation that stuck to basically everything it touched.
  The first time it happened, during World War II, researchers found it a nuisance. The second time, during the 1950s, a light bulb went on in somebody's head. The product was first sold commercially in 1958.
  Superglue mishaps
  Found on the web, attributed to the Indianapolis Star , February 7, 1994:
  True! A survey of the medical literature on superglue indicates this kind of mishap is far more common than one might assume. Apparently, people mistake the stuff for other, similarly-packaged products such as eye or ear drops all the time, and end up in the emergency room. In one study, researchers compiled a list of 14 different cases all of which occurred in a single year. This type of mishap, dubbed 'inadvertent self-administration of superglue' by physicians, has inspired consumer groups to call for repackaging of the adhesive.
  Hobbyists and home repair enthusiasts have been known to share tales of accidental adhesions, the consequences of which are usually benign and easily remedied. 'Have you had a little superglue mishap? Get your fingers stuck together?' asks one practical advice columnist. 'Use an old wash cloth and nail polish remover to clean that melted mess in no time!'  For what it's worth, I'm told that only nail polish removers containing acetone will work, but this is still handy advice in sticky situations.
  Superglue pranks
  From The Sun , a London tabloid, in 1996:
  Disbelieve if you will, but according to the BBC a strangely similar incident happened more recently in the United States, where, the story goes, 'a gambler sued a casino for 30,500 pounds after claiming he got stuck to a glue-smeared toilet seat and had to waddle through the casino for help.' (Drat those American toilets — no panic button!)
  'Superglue Revenge'
  And then there are the stories of, um, interpersonal bonding — the suspected criminal who superglued himself to his girlfriend to prevent police from arresting him; the woman who affixed herself to her foreign-born husband to stop authorities from deporting him; and the red-faced woman who showed up in the emergency room with both hands stuck to her boyfriend's private parts.
  Add a motive like revenge to such scenarios and you are smack in the middle of urban legends territory (in case you had any doubt up to this point).
  The best known of all cyanoacrylatic abuse tales is 'Superglue Revenge,' in which an angry wife/girlfriend allegedly waits until her philandering or abusive husband/boyfriend falls asleep then glues his penis to another body part (most often his thigh) — a cautionary tale to be heeded if there ever was one.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported several 'Superglue Revenge' variants in his 1984 collection of urban legends, The Choking Doberman . A Hollywood version popular in the early 1990s claimed that actress Sean Young did it to then-boyfriend James Woods during an exceptionally tempestuous break-up. Ms. Young, who believes the story was maliciously promulgated by Woods himself, dismissed it as a lie in a 1993 Playboy interview.
  In one of those disconcerting examples of life imitating legend, a 16-year-old girl in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was charged with assault in July 2000 for gluing her cheating boyfriend's penis to his abdomen. The girl claimed she meant it as a joke, but the boyfriend wound up in the hospital and juvenile authorities were not amused.
  Do not try this at home!
  Updates: Real-Life Superglue Antics Trump Urban Legends - Nov. 2005: Pittsburgh man sues former lover for 'battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress' resulting from his buttocks being fused together and his private parts affixed to his abdomen with superglue — all because he broke up with the woman after 10 months of dating. Also: a very sticky toilet seat. Superglue Revenge 2009 - Aug. 2009: News on a sticky situation in Wisconsin involving an unfaithful husband, his jilted wife, three women he cheated with, and a tube of Krazy Glue. Predictably, it didn't end well for the lothario.

"Thank You for All Your Educational Posts","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humor/a/Thank-You-For-Educational-Posts.htm","2013-01-17 02:30:33","  By David Emery
  A viral spoof recapping all the scary viral messages people have shared via email and social media for the past year (and longer).
  Description: Viral spoof / Internet parody Circulating since: 2010 Status: Amusing
  Example: As posted on Facebook, Dec. 8, 2012:
  As we progress into 2013, I want to thank you all for your educational posts the past year. I am totally screwed up now and have little chance of recovery.
  I can no longer open a bathroom door without using a paper towel, nor let the waitress put lemon slices in my ice water without worrying about the bacteria on the lemon peel .
  I can't sit down on a hotel bedspread because I can only imagine what has happened on it since it was last washed.
  I have trouble shaking hands with someone who has been driving because the number one pastime while driving alone is picking one's nose.
  Eating a little snack sends me on a guilt trip because I can only imagine how many gallons of trans fats I have consumed over the years.
  I can't touch any woman's handbag for fear she has placed it on the floor of a public toilet.
  I must send my special thanks for the email about rat poo in the glue on envelopes because I now have to use a wet sponge with every envelope that needs sealing.
  ALSO, now I have to scrub the top of every can I open for the same reason.
  I can't have a drink in a bar because I fear I'll wake up in a bathtub full of ice with my kidneys gone .
  I can't eat at KFC because their chickens are actually horrible mutant freaks with no eyes, feet or feathers.
  I can't use cancer-causing deodorants even though I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.
  Thanks to you I have learned that my prayers only get answered if I forward an e-mail to seven of my friends and make a wish within five minutes.
  Because of your concern, I no longer drink Coca Cola because it can also remove toilet stains .
  I no longer buy fuel without taking someone along to watch the car, so a serial killer doesn't crawl in my back seat when I'm filling up.
  I no longer use Cling Wrap in the microwave because it causes seven different types of cancer.
  And thanks for letting me know I can't boil a cup of water in the microwave anymore because it will blow up in my face , disfiguring me for life.
  I no longer go to the cinema because I could be pricked with a needle infected with AIDS when I sit down.
  I no longer go to shopping centers because someone will drug me with a perfume sample and rob me.
  And I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me to dial a number for which I will get a huge phone bill with calls to Jamaica, Uganda, Singapore and Uzbekistan.
  Thanks to you I can't use anyone's toilet but mine because a big black snake could be lurking under the seat and cause me instant death when it bites my butt.
  And thanks to your great advice I can't ever pick up a quarter coin dropped in the car park because it was probably placed there by a sex molester waiting to grab me as I bend over.
  I can't do any gardening because I'm afraid I'll get bitten by the Violin Spider and my hand will fall off.
  If you don't send this e-mail to at least 144,000 people in the next 70 minutes, a large dove with diarrhea will land on your head at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon, and the fleas from 120 camels will infest your back, causing you to grow a hairy hump. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of my next door neighbors ex mother-in-law's second husband's cousin's best friend's beautician!
  Oh, and by the way...
  A German scientist from Argentina , after a lengthy study, has discovered that people with insufficient brain activity read Face Book with their hand on the mouse.
  Don't bother taking it off now, it's too late.
  PS. I now keep my toothbrush in the living room, because I was told by a Status that water splashes over 6 ft. out of the toilet..
  NOW YOU HAVE YOURSELF A VERY GOOD DAY...

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: This omnibus spoof of viral safety warnings is an example of what folklorists call an 'anti-legend.' Its intent is to undermine the efficacy of various fear-inducing hoaxes, factoids, and urban legends circulating online by simultaneously mocking their content and mimicking their form. It functions as an 'inoculator,' if you will, against viral scare mongering.
  Other examples of the genre include the ' Gullibility Virus ' alert of 1997 and ' Thanks for All the Chain Letters ,' a 2004 email that appears to have been the direct inspiration for the current specimen. Share and enjoy!

"Joe Ball and His Alligator Pond","http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/joeball.htm","2012-10-26 21:47:38","  By Charles Montaldo
  A Bootlegger Career:
  Joe Ball decided on a career as a bootlegger, over working in a legitimate family business, after he graduated from the University of Texas. By the late 1920s he was the owner of the Sociable Inn, a saloon located near Elmendorf, Texas.
  Alligator Pond:
  As a source of entertainment to his patrons, Ball built a large alligator pond and would invite customers to watch at feeding time; the usual entree being live cats and dogs.
  Women Mysteriously Vanish:
  After several barmaids, girl friends and two of his wives vanished into thin air, the local authorities began to suspect that Ball was up to no good. However, his intimidating nature kept the suspicious and curious at bay.
  One Shot to the Head:
  On September 24, 1948, a group of Texas Rangers decided to go and question Ball about all the missing women. Instead of talking to them, he opted to shoot himself in the head.
  The Handy Man Talks:
  A handy man for Ball, Clifford Wheeler, soon admitted to helping Ball get rid of the bodies of some the women Ball killed.
  He led them to the remains of Hazel Brown and Minnie Gotthard. Wheeler told authorities that Ball murdered at least 20 other women, but the alligators had disposed of any evidence to back up his claim.
  A Neighbor in Fear:
  A neighbor, who had fled to California after fearing that Ball would kill him, admitted to seeing Ball dismembering a body near the alligator pit.
  No Evidence:
  No real evidence was ever found that determined that Ball actually fed his victims remains to the alligators.

"6 Ways to Help Your Dog Settle into a New Home When Moving House","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humor/fl/Two-Duck-Hunters-a-Stick-of-Dynamite-and-a-Dog.htm","2016-08-05 00:29:25","  By Diane Schmidt
  While it may be true that most dogs generally cope better than the average cat when settling in, they still require special care and handling. This is especially true if you're moving from a home to an apartment or from a large house to a smaller home . Room to move around and exercise can be critical to a dog's contentment and help them get to know their new neighborhood .
  So, to help your dog adjust to a move, follow these tips:
  You will be surprised by how much better they handle it when they are included in the dialogue. The calmness in your voice will reassure them that all is well, and that there is nothing to fear.
  Remember that animals pick up on your emotions. Be sure that you are giving off vibes that are happy as well as calming. If you feel anxious and overwhelmed , your dog will soon be as well.
  Just like children who are moving , dogs like routine and schedules.

  Decor Secrets Home Stagers Don't Want You to Know
  If you can stick to what your dog knows as his or her normal day, you'll find that your pooch adjust so much more quickly - take them for walks, engage in play and feed them at the same times as before you moved. This will help your dog feel more secure and at home in the new space.
  Have the dog's favorite toys, blankets and bed ready to roll out as soon as you move in . Most pets, including cats , crave normalcy and familiar smells, things and people. Show them their new space and where they'll be sleeping and you'll find they will quickly settle into their new home .
  When taking your dog outside for the first time, keep him or her leashed and allow them the time to explore their new neighborhood . Your dog should be introduced to the area around your home slowly. It's a good idea to explore it a block at a time, just to see who else lives in your neighborhood. Strange dogs can pose a threat and cause your pet unnecessary stress.  And before you let your dog off leash in your yard or at a doggy park, make sure you have their tags and collar, just in case they get scared and run off. But again, before letting them off leash, make sure they know where they live and feel comfortable in their new environment.
  If possible, allow yourself some time before you start your new job . This will give you time to help your dog adjust. During this period of adjustment, start spending time away from the house, doing so in small increments just to see how your dog will respond. Eventually, when you do start work and you have to spend all day away, your dog should be adjusted to the home and feel comfortable being alone there.
  If you have to start work right away, you may want to consider hiring a pet sitter to come to your home. They can usually cater to individual needs and requests and they charge by the hour. Although it may add up in fees, you can ask the sitter to spend more time with your dog initially, then slowly wean him back until he/she's used to being alone.
  No matter what kind of pet you have, adjusting to a new home is tough. Knowing your animal and the kind of pet they are - confident, social or shy - will help you determine what their individual needs are and help you provide the comfort they need.

"The Troll in the Closet","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/humor/a/troll_in_the_closet.htm","2014-11-07 19:22:30","  In this well-traveled urban legend a parent returns hom from a shopping trip to find her mentally-challenged son in a very excited state. 'I caught a troll and trapped him in the closet!' he exclaims. Upon investigation, she finds that the 'troll' is a very short census taker who just happened to knock on the wrong door at the wrong time.
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: Nov. 2009
  Example #1: As posted on an online message board, April 11, 2010:
  Example #2: As posted on an online message board, Dec. 8, 2009:
  Example #3: As told by reader Amber S., March 17, 2010:
  Analysis: One of the hallmarks of an urban legend is variability. The specifics of the story change depending on who's telling it, where, and when.
  In the three versions of the tale recounted above, for example, the little person mistaken for a troll is variously said to have been imprisoned by 1) 'a co-worker's sister's autistic son,' 2) 'a friend's adult autistic son,' or 3) someone's 'mentally-challenged brother.' One variant says the victim was a census taker (which is clearly false given the date it was posted, since according to the Census Bureau its employees were not yet in the field as of March 9, 2010); another says he was distributing leaflets; the third offers no explanation for his presence at all. In other online versions the little person is a Jehovah's Witness or a magazine salesman.
  Some storytellers say the troll-trapper fed his captive by sliding Skittles candies under the door. Others say it was M&Ms.
  The Leprechaun in the Closet
  Still other variants claim the mentally-challenged person believed he had captured a leprechaun, not a troll. This example was posted on the Internet on March 2, 2010:
  In the foregoing version the story is set in northeast Arkansas, but other online tellings claim it happened in Louisiana, Ohio, Texas, Alabama, and even Sweden, to name but a few locations.
  Obviously, they can't all be true. In fact, it's pretty unlikely that any version of the story is true, especially considering that the basic premise was borrowed from an older urban legend in which a person (or group of people) high on mushrooms (or acid) captures what they take to be a 'gnome' (or leprechaun) and, guess what, locks it in a closet.

You know, I think Fox News is a little biased. They called it 'Interview with a Marksman.'' --Jay Leno 'In an interview on Fox News, Dick Cheney took full responsibility for shooting a fellow hunter. Then surprisingly, he broke down and admitted to killing two drifters in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1989.' --Jay Leno 'Cheney also admitted that he'd been drinking. He said he had one beer. Okay, it was a 40-ounce Colt .45, but just one.' --Jay Leno 'They were in a car, they drive along, they get out of the car, he shoots his friend in the face, then they get back in the car and they go hide for 18 hours.
  That's not hunting ... that's an episode of 'The Sopranos'' --Jay Leno 'Today, President Bush says he is standing behind the vice president. Way behind him.' --Jay Leno 'America remaining obsessed, fascinated, appalled, by what is being called 'Dick Cheney Shot A Guy In The Face-Gate.'' --Jon Stewart 'A mere five days after shooting a man in the face, Vice President Dick Cheney broke his silence about the incident by submitting to a no-holds-barred grilling at a public press conference.
  I'm just kidding. ... Actually, he sat down with Brit Hume on Fox News for not some much a grilling -- more of a teat suckle.' --Jon Stewart 'He sat down for a one-on-one with Fox News. Very bold choice. Dick Cheney sitting down with Fox News is like Mrs. Butterworth sitting down with the Pancake Channel.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'Cheney says he feels terrible about what happened. The man he shot was his friend and if he could, he'd give him the central processing unit right out of his own heart to make up for it.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'There was some talk that the vice president had been drinking before he went out to shoot and it turns out that was true. Cheney said he did have a beer during lunch. One beer, and the only reason he even drank it was to wash down the three hits of ecstasy.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'The real question now is, is this a one-time thing, or will the vice president try to kill again.' --David Letterman 'If this story gets any bigger, pretty soon they're going to have to tell the president.' --David Letterman 'You can't blame [Cheney]. Bush says you can spy on people without warrants, you can torture people, you can hold people without a trial, so Dick Cheney thinks, 'Oh what the hell, I can shoot a few guys.'' --Jay Leno 'I'm surprised Dick Cheney loves to hunt so much. The five times the government tried to give him a gun, he got a deferment.' --Jay Leno 'What a nightmare I had last night. I dreamed I was at a Washington party and I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home.' --Jay Leno 'The rumor is that Cheney may have been drinking and he wanted to wait until he sobered up. So he may have been drinking and then he shot a guy. And you know what's really scary about all of this -- what if it turns out all this time Bush was the smart one?'--Jay Leno 'The guy Cheney shot is a Texas lawyer. While he was lying there on the ground he actually handed himself his own business card.' --Jay Leno 'After Whittington had a heart attack, Cheney said, 'You big baby. I get those all the time. Walk it off.' --Jay Leno 'Mr. Whittington is doing fine, but based on this development, we're going to downgrade the condition of this story from 'Incredibly Hilarious' to 'Still funny, but, mmm, now a little sad.'' --Jon Stewart, on the heart attack Harry Whittington suffered 'It turns out now that Dick Cheney did not have a license to hunt, and coincidentally, turns out we didn't have a license to go into Iraq.' --David Letterman 'Kind of a sad study out today that single women over the age of 35 are more likely to be shot by the vice president than to find a husband.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'Remember when the most embarrassing thing to happen to a vice-president was misspelling the word potato?' --Jimmy Kimmel 'Police are still investigating. They want to know why Cheney was unable to see the hunter at the time of the accident. And, they also want to know how Cheney wound up with his wallet.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'The administration has been getting a lot of criticism for how they handled the situation. First, they didn't tell the media for almost a full day after it happed. The White House press corps was furious. They expect to be told when the vice president shoots a 78-year-old man in the face.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'Good news, ladies and gentlemen, we have finally located weapons of mass destruction: It's Dick Cheney.' --David Letterman, on Cheney's shooting accident 'But here is the sad part -- before the trip Donald Rumsfeld had denied the guy's request for body armor.' --David Letterman
  'We can't get bin Laden, but we nailed a 78-year-old attorney.' --David Letterman 'The guy who got gunned down, he is a Republican lawyer and a big Republican donor and fortunately the buck shot was deflected by wads of laundered cash. So he's fine. He took a little in the wallet.' --David Letterman 'Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a man during a quail hunt ... making 78-year-old Harry Whittington the first person shot by a sitting veep since Alexander Hamilton.
  Hamilton, of course, (was) shot in a duel with Aaron Burr over issues of honor, integrity and political maneuvering. Whittington? Mistaken for a bird.' --Jon Stewart 'Now, this story certainly has its humorous aspects. ... But it also raises a serious issue, one which I feel very strongly about. ...
  moms, dads, if you're watching right now, I can't emphasize this enough: Do not let your kids go on hunting trips with the vice president. I don't care what kind of lucrative contracts they're trying to land, or energy regulations they're trying to get lifted -- it's just not worth it.' --Jon Stewart 'The Vice President is standing by his decision to shoot Harry Whittington. Now, according to the best intelligence available, there were quail hidden in the brush. Everyone believed at the time there were quail in the brush. And while the quail turned out to be a 78- year-old man, even knowing that today, Mr. Cheney insists he still would have shot Mr. Whittington in the face. He believes the world is a better place for his spreading buckshot throughout the entire region of Mr. Wittington's face.' --'Daily Show' correspondent Rob Corddry 'Dick Cheney accidentally shot a fellow hunter, a 78-year-old lawyer.
  In fact, when people found out he shot a lawyer, his popularity is now at 92 percent.' --Jay Leno 'Cheney's defense is that he was aiming at a quail when he shot the guy. Which means that Cheney now has the worst aim of anyone in the White House since Bill Clinton.' --Jay Leno 'I think Cheney is starting to lose it.
  After he shot the guy he screamed, 'Anyone else want to call domestic wire tapping illegal?'' --Jay Leno 'When the ambulance got there, out of force of habit they put Cheney on the stretcher. No, the other guy!' --Jay Leno 'Dick Cheney is capitalizing on this for Valentine's Day. It's the new Dick Cheney cologne. It's called Duck!' --Jay Leno 'But all kidding aside, and in fairness to Dick Cheney, every five years he has to shed innocent blood or he violates his deal with the devil.' --Jimmy Kimmel 'According to the Washington Post, Vice President Dick Cheney is limping today because he injured his foot. Cheney said 'If you think my foot looks bad, you should see the old lady I was kicking.'' --Conan O'Brien 'The former chef of the White House has written a tell-all book. For example, he says that Dick Cheney, Vice President, his favorite dish is a dish called Chicken Gitmo. It's chicken bound and gagged on a bed of rice.' --David Letterman 'According to the latest poll, 66% of Americans believe Dick Cheney has been given too much power by President Bush, and the other 34% think President Bush has been given too much power by Dick Cheney.' --Jay Leno 'A Filipino spy broke into Dick Cheney's office this week, and that takes a lot because Dick Cheney's office is the back of a speeding ambulance.' --Bill Maher 'Vice President Dick Cheney will have elective surgery or, as his doctors call it, a pre-autopsy.' --Jay Leno 'A White House spokesman announced today that Vice President Dick Cheney's recovery is exceeding his doctor's expectations. You know what that means? He's still alive.' --Jay Leno 'President Bush sent Vice President Dick Cheney to New Orleans. Is that what they need down there? Another person requiring emergency medical help?' --Jay Leno 'Although the waters have receded from New Orleans, it's still a huge, huge problem and will be for months to come. You see the fresh water is contaminated with oil and gas. Actually, from Dick Cheney's perspective, the oil and gas is contaminated with fresh water.' -Jay Leno 'There's a rumor Dick Cheney may run for president in 2008. If he wins, that would make him the first three-term president since Franklin Roosevelt.' --Jay Leno 'We finally have a scandal in this election: Lesbogate. Bob Schieffer asked a question about is homosexuality a choice, and Kerry mention Cheney's daughter. The Cheneys are now furious at him. They say they are very proud of her daughter. They are so proud, she should never, ever be mentioned in public.' -Bill Maher 'Dick Cheney wouldn't even confirm that she's gay. She just says that she touches her roommate in an undisclosed location.' -Bill Maher 'Dick Cheney feels responsible for his daughter being a lesbian because growing up, she heard him say 'go f**k yourself' so many times, she finally tried it.' -Bill Maher 'The most amazing part of the debate was when Dick Cheney told John Edwards in his Darth Vader voice, 'John I am your father.'' --Jay Leno 'Dick Cheney said that if John Kerry wins, there will be another attack. Then Cheney said, if Bush wins, I'll call it off.' -Conan O'Brien 'The Bush campaign unveiled its new slogan. The new slogan is 'We've Turned A Corner And We're Not Turning Back.' This replaces their old slogan 'Do What Dick Cheney Says And Nobody Gets Hurt.'' -Conan O'Brien 'Cheney's temper got the best of him last week when he told Vermont Senator Pat Leahy to 'go F yourself' on the Senate floor. Wow that's so out of character. He seems like such a peach. ... Afterwards President Bush would not comment on Cheney's outburst adding, 'You think I want that psycho coming after me.' ... Dick Cheney does have a history of swearing, but usually he's clutching his chest and falling down.' -Craig Kilborn 'This was nice, President Bush wished the Iraqis God's grace on their road to democracy. And then Vice President Cheney told them to go F-themselves.' -Craig Kilborn
  'Big news coming out of Washington, Dick Cheney will be running again for vice president. He says he is very healthy and that he has a doctor watching him 24 hours a day. This is a big improvement, it used to be a coroner.' -David Letterman 'As Cheney told CNN, he has been 100 percent heart attack free since ascending to the vice presidency. He added, 'In fact, rather than giving me stress, being vice president has actually fueled my blackened soul, allowing me to gorge vampire-like on the bloody nectar of unlimited power.' I'm sorry that should have read 'I never felt better.'' -Jon Stewart, on Dick Cheney's insistence that he is the picture of health 'Vice President Dick Cheney has given another speech linking Saddam Hussein with the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
  Didn't President Bush say Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with the terrorist attacks? Here's my question, what if it turns out that Dick Cheney is the dumb one?' -Jay Leno 'The U.S. army confirmed that it gave a lucrative fire fighting contract in Iraq to the firm once run by the Vice President Dick Cheney without any competitive bidding.
  When asked if this could be conceived as Cheney's friends profiting from the war, the spokesman said 'Yes.'' -Conan O'Brien 'Vice President Cheney continues his whirlwind 11-nation middle eastern tour designed to bring America's anti-terror message to the region. That message: Help us fight terror or ...Is that oil?' -Jon Stewart 'Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has unveiled a new color-coded system to warn the public about different states of danger. Red is the highest state of alert, and it means that Dick Cheney is about to eat a mozzarella stick.' -Conan O'Brien 'Dick Cheney finally responded today to demands that he reveal the details of the Enron meetings. This is what he said. He met with unnamed people, from unspecified companies, for an indeterminate amount of time at an undisclosed location.
  Thank God he cleared that up. I'm ready to move on.' -Jay Leno 'Vice President Dick Cheney is currently out in South Dakota on a three-day hunting trip. What better place for a man who has had four heart attacks than to be carrying a big gun and a backpack through the snow looking for red meat.' -Jay Leno 'Plans are being discussed as to who will replace Dick Cheney if he has to resign for health reasons.
  It's not easy for President Bush, he can't just name a replacement. He would first have to be confirmed by the oil, gas and power companies' -Jay Leno 'President Bush is taking the entire month of August off.

What, are he and Bush electrocuting guys in the basement now?' -Jay Leno 'Yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney came down with laryngitis so his wife had to deliver a speech for him.

"Why Is the Ocean Salty? Whale Sperm!","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fish/fl/Why-Is-the-Ocean-Salty-Whale-Sperm.htm","2016-06-01 14:05:38","  By David Emery
  According to this viral message, your typical blue whale produces more than 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, a factoid offered up to explain why the oceans are salty. In reality, even the largest whales only ejaculate up to a few gallons of semen at a time.
  Description: Email hoax / Joke Text circulating since: October 2002 Image circulating since: June 2003 Status: False (details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Duane G., June 17, 2003:
  OH MY GOD!!!!
  FW: Don't drink the sea water... read below first....
  The average blue whale produces over 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, but only 10% of that actually makes it into his mate. So 360 gallons are spilled into the ocean every time one unloads, and you wonder why the ocean is so salty...
  Analysis: If you're looking for a scientific explanation of why the ocean is salty, click here . (Hint: It has nothing to do with whale sperm.)
  As to the viral message reproduced above, it's a two-part hoax, the text having first appeared as a ' Fact of the Day ' on email joke lists toward the end of 2002; the attached image is of unknown origin and didn't begin making the rounds until June 2003.

  It should be obvious at first glance that the text and image don't match. How could the relatively small aquatic specimen in the photo possibly produce 400 gallons of sperm at a go? By way of comparison, the capacity of an average hot tub is roughly that same amount, 400 gallons, meaning this poor creature would have to possess testicles twice the size of the rest of its body to live up to its glandular reputation.
  In point of fact, the animal in the photo probably isn't a blue whale — or any whale — at all (see below).
  Blue whales being the largest animals on the planet, it stands to reason that their reproductive organs ought to be of similarly impressive dimensions, and that is certainly the case. By one estimate, the penis of a blue whale can measure up to 16 feet long and its testicles weigh in at around 25 pounds apiece. But even packing 50 pounds of bollocks — the weight of an average-sized bulldog, if you need a benchmark — it's absurd to imagine that a blue whale (or any other creature on earth, for that matter) could produce 400 gallons of seminal fluid at a time, or even one-tenth that amount.
  For yet another comparison, I found a credible source stating that the southern right whale — which has testicles even larger than the blue whale's, weighing in a half-a-ton apiece — produces about five gallons of ejaculate in a single mating session. Five gallons, not 500.
  The statistic is clearly bogus.
  Finally, there's the question of whether the animal depicted in the viral image is even a blue whale at all — which, actually, it appears it is not. Blue whales average at least 75 feet in length. Using the human beings in the image above for scale, the creature is clearly smaller than a blue whale and most likely isn't any kind of whale at all, but rather a whale shark . Since sharks don't have penises per se, we must further conclude that either the photograph was doctored (though I could detect no obvious signs of that), or the spectacular appendage dangling between the animal's pelvic fins is one of its claspers , a pair of tubular organs with which a male shark fastens itself to the female and inseminates her during reproduction.
  • Blue whales can't possibly ejaculate 400 gallons of sperm (the capacity of an average-sized hot tub) — not even close.
  • The animal in the photo probably isn't a blue whale, nor is the circled appendage its penis.
  • There are good reasons to avoid making a habit of drinking sea water, but sperm spillover isn't one of them.
  • Which is more than can be said for hot tub water.

"The Barrel of Bricks","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/barrel_bricks.htm","2016-08-23 06:34:44","  By David Emery
  As told by Cory Vandenham...
  I am a general contractor and heard this story from an insurance investigator.
  A bricklayer working on a three-story-tall chimney had set up a pulley system so that his helper could raise the bricks up to where he needed them. As he was working, his helper complained about how difficult it would be to get the last of the bricks up to the flat roof of the building. Just then another contractor had some material delivered and it was placed on the roof by a fork lift brought to unload it. The bricklayer asked if the driver would load the rest of the bricks up there as well and the driver agreed. The bricklayer realized that he would not need his helper any more and sent him home.
  When the bricklayer completed the chimney he noticed that he had quite a few bricks left over and that the fork lift was no longer at the jobsite. Now he had to figure out how to get the leftover bricks back down by himself. If he dropped them, they would surely break. So he decided to use the pulley he had set up earlier to lower them down.

  First he went down to the ground and raised a large metal bucket up to the roof level using the rope and pulley. Next, he tied the rope off onto a railing and climbed back up to the roof and loaded the bricks into the bucket. Then he went back down to the ground. He knew that the bricks would be heavy, so he wrapped the rope around his hand a couple of times and then untied the end of the rope with his other hand. Well, the bricks were heavier than he imagined and with physics being as it is, he was immediately launched upwards at a high rate of speed.
  As he was racing up towards the roof he encountered the bucket full of bricks coming down at an equally fast rate. He collided with the bucket and broke his nose and his shoulder. The bucket passed him by as he sped upwards. He reached the pulley just before the bucket hit the ground and broke a few of his fingers as they were pulled into the pulley. When the bucket hit the ground, its bottom fell out and all of the bricks spilled onto the ground. Now the fun reversed. As the now light bucket sped upwards, the mason took a shot to the groin when one of his legs slipped into the empty bucket.
  He then tilted enough to fall out of the bucket and continued with his gravity experiment. Eventually he landed on top of the pile of bricks and broke both feet. He collapsed in pain there on the bricks, but was glad to be alive. He let go off the rope and cried out for help.
  It was then that the bucket hit him in the head and fractured his skull.
  Analysis: This is quite an old story, reckoned by folklorists to date back at least 80 years. It's a comedy staple, in fact, having turned up in numerous recordings, radio shows, movies and novels since the 1930s.
  And newspapers. A classic version that made the rounds in the late 1950s under headlines on the order of ' Saddened Bricklayer Asks for Sick Leave ' was attributed to an anonymous bricklayer in Barbados.
  A variant of the tale was published as a 'True Fact' by National Lampoon in 1986, when it was also circulating from workplace to workplace as 'office faxlore.' More recently it has been sighted on email joke lists, a multitude of websites and blogs, and social media.
