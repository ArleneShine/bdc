  Synopsis: Internet users are circulating a fake 'Fox News' story via social media claiming that President Obama declared December 'National Muslim Appreciation Month.' Obama has made no such declaration, nor are any other statements or quotations in the article accurate or true. Though many people have seen fit to share and repost it, it's clearly a prank.
  Description: Fake news / Hoax Circulating since: November 2015 Status: False
  Example: Posted on FoxNews.com.hk, November 7, 2015:
  Obama Declares December As National Muslim Appreciation Month
  Written by: Darius Rubics
  Washington, DC — President Barack Obama held a press conference today to announce his decision which will make the month of December ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’.
  “The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,” Obama told reporters. “We have disrespected these innocent and peaceful people in so many ways. We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So from now on, December will be a month to celebrate the Muslim people, the Sunnah and the Quran.”

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: With the recent ISIS terror attacks in Paris , the timing was right for this poorly written, unoriginal bit of satire, which otherwise would have probably never seen the light of day. The article was published on Nov. 7, 2015, several days before the attacks occurred, on FoxNews.com.hk, a web domain which, despite appearances, has nothing to do with Fox News or any of its parent companies or affiliates. No legitimate news organization was involved in its dissemination.
  According to its WHOIS listing, the domain's actual owner is one Paul Horner , a serial prankster and prolific author of fake news articles on a number of different websites.
  By the looks of things, Mr. Horner is running out of fresh ideas. An almost identical article appeared two years ago on the news satire site NationalReport.net. It, too, bore the pseudonymous byline 'Darius Rubics,' and it, too, claimed that Obama held a press conference announcing a 'Muslim Appreciation Month.'
  As the debunkers at Politifact.com pointed out at the time, no such proclamation appears anywhere on the White House website or on any other government websites, because no such proclamation was made.
  'He has declared heritage months for Irish-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean-Americans and Hispanics,' wrote Politifact's Becky Bowers. 'He has proclaimed a month for appreciation of African-American music. But nothing about Muslims.'
  Which must come as a shock to all those further-right American citizens who have convinced themselves not only that Barack Obama is sympathetic to Muslim extremists, but that he is a covert Muslim and dedicated to either converting the entire country or letting Islamic terrorists destroy it. Those people are the target audience of this hoax, of course. They find the premise plausible and outrageous, so they share the article. They share it a lot, in fact, which is precisely what Paul Horner intended.
  Had they read through to the end, they would have found this paragraph in which the author gives himself away:
  Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, is a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country speaking to children about the dangers of masturbation, told Fox News he does not agree with what Obama is doing.
  It pays to read what you're about to post before clicking that Share button. Just sayin'.

""15 Days of Darkness" Hoax Won't Die","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/fl/15-Days-of-Darkness-Hoax.htm","2015-10-24 23:35:59","  By David Emery
  Ignore social media reports claiming that NASA has signed off on a prediction that the earth will undergo 15 days of darkness in November 2015 due to an odd confluence of cosmic events. Nothing of the sort has been predicted by scientists.
  Variants of the fabricated story have been circulating since 2012 . The current version first appeared on the fake news website NewsWatch33.com , which makes its hay spoofing current events and recycling online hoaxes. The preposterous headlines on the front page of the site say everything you need to know, but if you're in need of further convincing check the disclaimer , which states — or rather understates — that a portion of the site's content is satirical.
  It appears to me to be 100% satirical, but in any case the fabricated content isn't marked as such, so the site is generally unreliable even there is a nugget or two of fact hidden on it.
  According to the article in question , NASA administrator Charles Bolden — who is a real person — presented the Obama administration with a 1,000-page report on the upcoming cosmic event.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Here's an excerpt from NewsWatch33's summary of the alleged document:
  According to the report, on October 26, 2015, Venus and Jupiter will engage in a close parallelism, only being separated by 1 degree. Venus will pass to the southwest of Jupiter, causing Venus to shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. The light from Venus will heat up the gases on Jupiter causing a reaction.
  Codswallop. Planets don't 'engage in close parallelisms' — whatever that's supposed to mean. Astronomers do sometimes describe planets as being in ' conjunction ' — meaning that from an earthly vantage point the planets appear to move closer together in the sky from time to time as they orbit around the sun — but in reality the planets are never close enough together to affect one another physically.
  Venus and Jupiter are, on average, 416,399,477 miles apart.
  The claim that 'light from Venus will heat up the gases on Jupiter, causing a reaction' makes no sense, either. Venus isn't a light source; any light emanating from it would only be reflected light from the sun. No matter how close the two planets got, the light from Venus wouldn't be intense enough to cause atmospheric changes on Jupiter.
  'The gaseous reaction will release an unprecedented amount of Hydrogen into Space,' the next paragraph begins. Why are 'Hydrogen' and 'Space' capitalized in that sentence? I don't know. Might as well move on.
  Ultimately, the hydrogen from Jupiter is supposed to reach the sun, causing a massive explosion. Here's where it gets even more stupid: 'The sun will then attempt to cease the explosions by emitting heat from its core. The heat will cause the sun to dim [ sic ] to a bluish color.'
  Why would increased heat cause the sun to dim ? I don't know. Again, let's move on.
  Once the sun 'dims' to a 'bluish color,' supposedly, it will take 15 days for its surface to return to its normal 'Red Giant' temperature (never mind that astronomers classify the sun as a 'red dwarf' star, not a 'red giant'). During this two-week period the earth will remain in total darkness, we are told, yet, miraculously, the planet will suffer no ill effects apart from a six to eight degree increase [ sic ] in temperature.
  Charles Bolden of NASA is quoted in the article as saying the polar ice caps will not be 'majorly' affected by the event, about which 'No one should worry much.'
  <sarcasm> And that, of course, is exactly how NASA officials speak. </sarcasm>

"Does AriZona Tea Contain Human Urine?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/fl/AriZona-Tea-Uses-Human-Urine-in-Products.htm","2017-01-06 13:15:13","  By David Emery
  A viral fake news story originally published on the satirical website Huzlers.com claimed that AriZona Tea and other products manufactured by the Arizona Beverage Company contain human urine as an 'active ingredient.' The FDA has supposedly ordered it removed from store shelves. This was false, fabricated as an attempt at humor and satire.
  Example #1: Via Huzlers.com, April 19, 2015:
  AriZona Tea Exposed By FDA For Using Human Urine In Products; Will Be Taken Off Shelves
  NEW YORK — Popular American tea company AriZona has been reportedly discovered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be using Human Urine in their products as an active ingredient.
  Upon being unexpectedly inspected a few days ago, FDA inspectors visited five of AriZona's biggest factories in the United States and what they discovered was shocking. They discovered thousands and thousands of gallons of large industrial containers containing human urine.

  I just read that Arizona Tea won't be sold anymore. The Food and Drug Administration found human urine in there tea. Eewww!!
  Example #3: Via Twitter, April 29, 2015:
  I found out that Arizona tea has been putting human urine in their drinks this whole time... My life has been a nasty lie
  This hogwash originated as a fake news article on Huzlers.com , a website that describes itself as 'the most notorious urban satirical entertainment website with the most shocking headlines and articles.'
  It also boasts the most misspellings and grammatical errors of any website of its kind. Hard as it may be to believe that anyone could mistake this stuff for actual news, some people do. Unfortnately, many read only headlines on Facebook and other social media and then share posts with friends without checking the source.
  The basic premise of the story — that a bodily fluid (in this case, urine) has been found to be a secret ingredient in a popular, commercially sold beverage — is a familiar one. A rumor dating from the early 2000s holds that Red Bull and other popular energy drinks derive their energy-enhancing powers from the addition of bull semen or bull urine to the basic recipe, for example. Going back even further in time to the late 1980s, the scuttlebutt among beer drinkers was that Corona, the extra-foamy, bright yellow lager imported from Mexico and sold in clear glass bottles, was contaminated with the urine of brewery workers . Neither of these rumors proved to have any basis in fact.
  The allegations about AriZona Tea are also reminiscent of viral alerts that date back several years warning that an HIV-positive worker purposely contaminated products in a Pepsi-Cola (or similarly high-profile) soft drink plant with his own blood, thereby exposing consumers to the AIDS virus. Despite claims that these alerts were issued by governmental authorities, they did not come from any official sources, nor, as far as anyone knows, were they based on actual incidents. According to the CDC , the AIDS virus doesn't live long enough outside the human body to make transmission via food or beverage practicable. In any case, the experts say, even if a bit of the live virus were consumed this way it would be destroyed by digestive acids in the stomach before infection could occur.

Democrat leaders applauded Facebook’s move, stating that it is important to know who has guns in America, especially since many of the weapons that they’d seen could very well be unregistered.

  Analysis: Regular followers of this site should be familiar with the source of this hoax, Empire News , a self-described 'satirical and entertainment website' that spoofs current events and pop culture icons by publishing fake news articles for social media consumption. 'We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized,' the site disclaimer states. 'Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.'
  That includes the name of Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who has not, in fact, announced that the company plans on divulging the names of users who have posted photos of themselves holding guns to the Department of Homeland Security.

  ATLANTA - It is being reported that Multi-Billionaire Microsoft Founder Bill Gates has offered Atlanta Rapper Young Thug 9 Million dollars cash to stop making music.
  Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffrey Williams, is known for his eccentric style of rap and making random noises in his music. Bill Gates has told reporters 'I may not be an avid rap listener but i sure heard Young Thug’s music and instantly went into depression.

Young Thug has yet to reply to the offer.

  Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34
  Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.
  At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man's identity at this time.
  'The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,' said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.
  Born August 26, 1980, Culkin began acting at the tender age of four. At the height of his fame, he was regarded as the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple.
  This story is still developing. More details will be made available once they emerge.
  Analysis: False. Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin has not been reported dead by any official agencies or legitimate media sources. Despite the fact that it originated on a web page with the URL 'http://msnbc.website,' it's neither an actual news site nor does it have any connection with MSNBC News . According to its WHOIS listing , the domain name was registered barely a week before the article was published. Its owner has chosen to remain anonymous.
  Portions of the text were copied verbatim from a previous hoax declaring that '80s 'Brat Pack' actor Judd Nelson was found dead in his Los Angeles condo.
  Nota bene: MediaMass.net is also a hoax
  Some venues are inaccurately reporting that the source of the Culkin death hoax was a Facebook page 'with over one million likes' proclaiming that 'our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.' In point of fact, no such Facebook page exists, or existed. The erroneous reports are based on misinformation purveyed by yet another fake news website called MediaMass.net , which maintains scores of virtually identical pages pre-emptively debunking celebrity death hoaxes.
  For example, the copy on the ' Macaulay Culkin Dead 2014 ' page on MediaMass.net reads as follows:
  Macaulay Culkin death hoax spreads on Facebook
  Rumors of the actor’s alleged demise gained traction on Thursday after a ‘ R.I.P. Macaulay Culkin ’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American actor’s passing:
  Compare that to the copy on MediaMass.net's ' George Clooney Dead 2104 ' page:

  BREAKING: 'Brat Pack' Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo
  Last Updated: 10/26/2014 @ 01:36 AM EST
  BREAKING NEWS: Sources are reporting that Judd Nelson, best known for his roles as John Bender in The Breakfast Club, has been found dead at age 55.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.
  Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.
  The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.
  Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term 'Brat Pack' being coined.
  In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.
  Additional details and information will be updated as it becomes available. This story is still developing.
  Analysis: Judd Nelson is alive and well according to his Hollywood agent Gregg Klein, who not only denied Internet reports of the actor's death on October 26, 2014 but provided a photo of Nelson holding a copy of that day's edition of the Los Angeles Times as proof.
  A fake news story (see screen shot above) claiming Nelson was found dead of unknown causes in his L.A. condo was published on the website foxnews.es, which has no discernible connection to the Fox News channel or FoxNews.com, and no other content aside from this hoax. According to the site's WHOIS record , the domain name is registered to a Uvalde, Texas resident named Fred Post. (Update: that domain name is now for sale.)

  Example: Excerpt from Universalnoticias.org, Nov. 1, 2014:
  GABRIEL IGLESIAS FOUND DEAD, NOT CONFIRMED BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A HEALTH COMPLICATION.
  Gabriel Iglesias was one of the best standup comedians in the world. His constant touring garnered him international fame and his observational comedy and impressionism provided great comedy gags for the fans. Iglesias’s signature-style Hawaiian t-shirts, jokes about obesity and the smooth story-telling have won him millions of fans. He won numerous awards and accolades, including the key to the city of El Paso. Hector Saldaña dubbed him a “comedy genius.” Funny, charismatic, a people person, the best comedian around were just a few of his many qualities.
  Gabriel Iglesias,  (born July 15, 1976) known profesionally  as Gabriel Iglesias and comically as Fluffy died this Friday for causes that are still not confirmed but it seems to be a health complication. He has four sisters and one brother.
  Analysis: Completely false. Comedian Gabriel 'Fluffy' Iglesias is alive and well and has been actively responding to this hoax via Facebook and Twitter.
  'Seriously?! I must be doing good in life,' Iglesias tweeted the day after the above article went viral. 'More fake #FluffyDied shit popping up.'
  A few hours later he wrote on his Facebook page :
  According to this article below I guess I died Friday and no one decided to tell me. Well, since I'm dead now I guess I can start eating carbs again. It was a good life. Had a great childhood and an amazing career. I traveled the world and got drunk in all 50 states, woooooo! I made a lot of people happy over the years and pissed off most my ex girlfriends in the process. Can't win them all, right? Soooo I guess I want to be buried somewhere people can visit my grave, put pretty flowers and pour diet cokes on my plot. I'm gonna want my estate to buy both plots next to me so that even in death I can stretch my legs. I would love it very much if people were to visit my grave and take selfies with it. Even in death I'm still a social media attention whore, #FarewellFluffy . There should be no charge to visit my grave so don't pay any attention to the shady guy by the gate with the comedy club passes in the new Jaguar trying to raise money by selling tickets to get in the cemetery. U just tell him to go fund himself and he will leave u alone.
  Source of the story was a fake news website
  The hoax originally appeared November 1, 2014 on the fake news website Universalnoticias.org (now deleted), which explained its rather unusual mission as follows (translated from the Spanish by Google):
  The content of this page is not real, it's just a social experiment performed by Canadian students currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching for education in developing countries.
  The experiment attempts to collect vital data that may provide information on the relationship between Third World countries and the content they read. People living in the richest and most powerful countries in the world, tend to read at an early age, culture articles, historical, political, investment articles, health articles in all high value that enriches and humans, these items are the 'good' question. People living in poor countries mostly prefer reading things celebrities, religious articles, cartoons, novels, and her favorite shows are reality shows, these items are considered 'junk'.
  Our experiment is to obtain data items considered good, and comparing the number of visitors compared to trash items.
  By 'trash items' the authors presumably mean articles such as this one falsely declaring Mr. Iglesias dead. We look forward to viewing the results of their 'experiment.' (UPDATE: Apparently the experiment is over. Not long after the article went viral, the entire website was deleted.)

  Iconic rapper Tupac Shakur died on September 13, 1996 of gunshot wounds sustained during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was 25. The case was never solved, however, giving rise to any number of conspiracy theories about the circumstances of his death and rumors that he either survived the shooting or faked his own death and went into hiding.
  Various Internet hoaxes have sprung up purporting to prove that Tupac is still alive. On April Fools' Day 2005, for example, a bogus CNN story appeared claiming he had been spotted strolling the streets of Beverly Hills. More recently, on August 28, 2014, the satirical website Huzlers.com posted a photo supposedly showing a 43-year-old Shakur posing with his arm around singer Beyonce.

  The image is a doctored version of a photo taken in 2012 of Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z. As for the accompanying text, it looks to have been written by a 12-year-old badly in need of remedial English lessons:
  California, U.S. – Tupac Shakur who was supposedly killed at the age of 25 is now admitting he has been hiding this whole time. It was Shakur who in 1996 was reportedly attending a special event in Las Vegas, the Mike Tyson-Benson fight, and then afterwards was brutally murdered. A day or so later he is autopsied, then quickly cremated. There is no funeral. Nor is there any record of a tribute or memorial. Now we know exactly why it was because Tupac Shakur was never killed it is unclear why he has been hiding. This story is still under development but Tupac has already been spotted with Celebrities.

  Example: Via DailyBuzzLive.com, July 2, 2014:
  Human Meat Found In McDonald’s Meat Factory. Previously we brought you a report that detailed disturbing audio admissions by a man that claimed McDonald’s uses human meat as a filler in their 100% beef hamburgers and the fact that McDonald’s has been accused of using worm meat fillers.  Now, inspectors have allegedly found human meat and horse meat in the freezer’s of an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory. Human meat was also recovered in several trucks that were on their way to deliver the patties to the restaurants. According to various reports, authorities have inspected factories and restaurants across the country and have found human meat in 90% of the locations. Horse meat was found in 65% of the locations. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler reporters, “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible”.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: Truly horrible indeed. A version of this fabricated story originally appeared on the humor website Huzlers.com in February 2014. Though roundly debunked, the same story showed up again five months later on Daily Buzz Live, a self-described 'news and entertainment' venue which acknowledges on its contact page that 'some stories on this website are fictitious.' In point of fact, the editors of Daily Buzz Live make no effort whatsoever to distinguish fact from fiction. The bulk of what passes for 'news' on the site is self-evidently spurious.
  Previous Daily Buzz Live articles have claimed, for example, that worm meat is used as a filler in McDonald's burgers and that several popular energy drinks like Red Bull and Monster contain bull semen . Both claims are based on well-known urban legends.
  For anyone tempted to give this story the benefit of the doubt, here's something to consider. McDonald's uses over a billion pounds of beef annually in the United States alone. Even if it were legal to sell human meat — which it isn't — and even if McDonald's hamburgers contained only one percent human meat 'filler' by weight — which they don't — that would mean the company would have to source, buy, and process at least 10 million pounds of human meat per year.
  From where? And at what cost?

  Analysis: No such incident took place. This is a satirical article that originally appeared on the humor website DailyCurrant.com on May 5, 2014. It's a spoof, a joke, fake news.

  A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.
  This particular fictional story appears to be very loosely based on 2011 news reports about Colton Burpo, a 4-year-old in Nebraska who told his parents after recovering from a near-death experience that he had seen Jesus and 'streets of gold' in heaven, not to mention long-dead relatives he had never met.

  McDonald’s Uses Worm Meat Fillers But Can Legally Call It 100% Beef. Large companies have been the subject of rumors that they substitute unusual or unethical substances in their products, usually to decrease costs. McDonald’s is not immune to such claims. McDonald’s has been accused of using everything from worms to cow eyeballs in its burgers. Dating far back to at least 1978, there have been rumors that McDonald’s restaurants use earthworms in their hamburgers.
  The fact that McDonald’s uses cow eyeballs and worm fillers does not stop them from legally using the claim that they served 100% beef. McDonald’s has assured its consumers that its product contains 100% beef. They are allowed to do this because McDonald’s buys their “beef” from a company called “100% Beef Company”, making it possible for McDonald’s to call beef byproducts and soy products “100% beef”.

  Analysis: Here's a recipe for bad satire : Take some old fast food urban legends , add a few sentences copied and pasted from a Wikipedia article , post a borrowed image of ground beef mixed with morsels of butter that look like white worms, and garnish with lame jokes. Guaranteed to go viral!
  The perpetrator of this unoriginal hoax is a (now defunct) fake news website called Daily Buzz Live . Recent Daily Buzz headlines include: 'Dogs Getting High on Medical Marijuana in Colorado Is On the Rise,' 'Energy Drinks Contain Ingredient Extracted From Bull Urine And Semen,' and 'Apple Maps Finds Lock [ sic ] Ness Monster.'
  Reliable source? Clearly not.
  As noted in the above-mentioned Wikipedia article, the ' worms as filler ' urban legend has been around since the late 1970s. According to folklorist Gary Alan Fine, the earliest version named Wendy's as the burger chain guilty of substituting earthworms for real meat. 'However, the target of the stories soon changed to McDonald's, the largest fast food franchiser in America,' Fine wrote in Manufacturing Tales: Sex and Money in Contemporary Legends (Univ.
  of Tennessee Press, 1992). 'The frequency of attachment of an urban legend to the largest company or corporation is so common as to be considered a law of urban folklore.'
  McDonald's has long claimed that it uses 'only 100% USDA-inspected beef,' and lists its suppliers on its company websites. A supplier called '100% Beef Company' is not among them. In fact, no such company exists. 'There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called 'pink slime' in our beef,' McDonald's further states. 'The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.'
  As I've pointed out before, worms cost way more than ground beef , anyway. The same goes for beef byproducts like cow eyeballs . Any meat byproducts used in McDonald's burgers would have to be listed as such among the ingredients, per USDA regulations.

  Analysis: What's all the fuss about? A strangely popular viral video titled ' Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High .'
  The video begins with a voice-over narration: 'It's a new way to get high, and it's called bed bugs.' (Pause.) 'That's because it is bed bugs.'
  Then an alleged user describes what a bed bug high is like: 'It made me just feel, you know, like I was walking through wet concrete.'
  Then it's explained how this shocking new 'teen drug' achieves its intoxicating effects: 'Bed bugs have a known hallucinogen that if smoked or injected can cause major hallucinations. There's no way to extract that active chemical, known as PH-417, so the entire bug is dried, crushed, and then smoked. And sometimes even injected.'
  Except none of it is true.
  The video is a prank, a homemade mash-up assembled from existing news footage with a real-sounding — but fictitious — narration. Bed bugs are not, in fact, hallucinogenic. While the miniscule insects do produce tiny amounts of certain volatile chemicals associated with mating activities which give them their distinct, 'bed buggy' odor, their bodies contain no such substance as 'PH-417,' and there's no way you can get high by smoking them.
  'Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High' is an amusing spoof of those 'scary new drugs teenagers are doing' exposés so beloved by the mainstream media. As best I can determine, the video was first uploaded to LiveLeak.com on April 7, 2014 by a user named John Cain, whose profile states, 'All of the videos that I post are mine and made by me.'
  We will take him at his word, and now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
  Update: John Cain confirmed making the video in a blog post dated April 7, 2014.
  Update: 'Smoking Bedbugs' Hoax Video Uses Footage From Bogus Dabbing Report - Phoenix New Times reports that the original ABC 15 news segment from which the bed bugs hoax video was assembled had fact-checking issues of its own.

  San Francisco, CA — On Monday history was made at the Chapel of Our Lady at the Presidio in San Francisco as the first-ever state recognized human-animal marriage took place.

  - Read Full Text -
  Analysis: If you've seen the above article before, you probably encountered it on any number of cut-and-paste blogs that replicate material from other sites — often without attribution, making it all the more difficult to judge its authenticity — but in this case the text actually originated on a satirical website called National Report .
  As the site's disclaimer page clearly states, 'All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.'
  The article is a none-too-subtle spoof on reactionary attitudes toward same-sex marriage, the legalization of which in certain states, including California, has been met with the argument that it's a slippery slope to legalized polygamy, parent-child marriage , or even interspecies marriage . For satirical purposes, National Report has taken the argument to its logical extremity. Incredibly (or not, depending how jaded the Internet has made you), some readers have misinterpreted the article as factual.
  The supposed 1850 California law making human-animal marriage legal, identified as 'article 155, paragraph 10' of 'the book of California’s State Laws and Regulations,' doesn't exist (if you don't believe me, go to California Codes and try looking it up yourself).
  Indeed, if any law as anachronistic and laughable as the following (directly quoted from the National Report article) ever had been on the books, it would have been nullified long before now:
  What foresight!
  In any case, it's a poor parody of real legalese, which, though sometimes inscrutable, tends to eschew editorial comments and stick closer to the point. Here, for example, is how California's actual law prohibiting interracial marriages read in 1933:
  All marriages of white persons with negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void.
  The law underwent various minor changes (mainly in the form of adding more ethnic categories with which members of the Caucasian race were forbidden to intermarry) between 1850, when it was enacted, and 1948, when it was repealed, but there was never any language in the statute that attempted to justify the prohibitions with a 'slippery slope' or any other kind of argument.
  According to a Wikipedia article on the subject, human-animal marriage is not recognized in law by any country on earth, 'although attempts to marry animals have been recorded.' Among the species with which such attempts have been made, allegedly, are dogs , cats, horses, snakes , dolphins and cows.

  Giant Squid Discovered On California Coast And Scientists Suspect Radioactive Gigantism
  By BUTCH WITT
  For the second time in recent months, a giant sea creature has washed ashore in California.  First it was a rare oarfish that had grown to a freakish 100-foot length.  This time it was a giant squid measuring a whopping 160 feet from head to tentacle tip.
  These giants look different but experts believe they share one important commonality: they both come from the waters near the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in the Futaba District of Japan.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: Clearly a hoax. Consider the source, a 'news' website called, of all things, ' Lightly Braised Turnip .'
  Consider, too, that source's ' publisher's statement ,' which includes among its so-called 'guiding principles' the vow to 'never be satisfied with merely printing news but also create news where needed.'
  That this is indeed an instance of 'created news' is borne out by the absence of all mention of this newsworthy incident in legitimate media sources, local or national. And by the fact that the image above purporting to document the impossibly huge 160-foot giant squid is, in reality, an altered version of an Oct. 2013 photo showing a real, though much smaller (30-foot-long), squid found washed up on a beach in Spain. (As a reference point, the largest giant squid ever recorded was 43 feet long.)
  Finally, for good measure I looked up a couple of the 'experts' quoted in the Lightly Braised Turnip article, Santa Monica Parks Manager Cynthia Beard and Santa Marino College biology professor Martin L.
  Grimm. Unsurprisingly, neither exists.

  January 4th 2014 – Planetary Alignment Decreases Gravity – Float For 5 minutes! #ZeroGDay
  It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014,  an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.
  Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: This may sound familiar to connoisseurs of April Fools Day pranks. It's a loose homage to what many consider to be one of the greatest leg-pulls of all time , namely a BBC radio broadcast on April 1, 1976 during which famed amateur astronomer Patrick Moore announced that an unusual planetary alignment would briefly counteract the force of gravity on Earth at 9:47 that morning.
  Anyone who jumped in the air at exactly that moment would experience weightlessness and a floating sensation, Moore promised. He labeled the phenomenon, which was supposedly the result of the planet Pluto briefly passing behind Jupiter, the 'Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.' Though the prediction was (and is) a load of codswallop — other planets in our solar system do, in fact, exert a gravitational pull on earthly objects, but the amount is infinitesimal — hundreds of radio listeners reportedly called in to say they had indeed felt weightless for a fleeting moment.
  Let's hope the silliness doesn't go that far this time around.
  March 2014 update: News-Hound has re-published the prank article , now claiming the miraculous planetary alignment occurs on April 4, 2014. Fooled us twice? I hope not!
  Dec. 2014 update: Fake news site Daily Buzz Live has resurrected the hoax yet again with a new article claiming the planetary alignment will occur on Jan. 4, 2015.

  Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.
  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.
  'I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act,' said Dr. B.J. Sooner of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. 'I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women.'
  The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.
  'Only with regular performance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine,' said Dr. Inserta Shafteer, one of the researchers at the University. 'Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances.'
  The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.
  In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.
  Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or 'play down' these findings.
  'This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases,' Lictepeen said.
  Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.
  'There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages,' he said.
  Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers.
  The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not. The group of women who had performed fellatio had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.
  'The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio,' Shafteer said. 'It's a cause, not THE cause.'

"Jimmy Fallon Talks About "Fever Pitch"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Derek-Jeter-Cancels-Retirement.htm","2016-02-17 06:31:41","  Fallon on His Favorite Baseball Team and Being a Fan: I was born and raised in New York so Ive got to be a New York fan.
  Im not as crazy a fan as the guy in this movie. I only catch three or four games a year, if anything. In the movie, this guy got like  hes a Red Sox fan  and he has like Red Sox sheets and Red Sox pillow cases and a poster of Carl Yastrzemski in his living room and a framed Sports Illustrated Tony Conigliaro that he genuflexes to before he leaves the house.
  So Im not a crazy as that. Hes got Fenway Park in his living room, like the Green Monster painted on his living room wall.
  Tapping Into That Obsession: Man, you hang in Boston for a week and you get it. Its beyond baseball when youre in Boston. Its not even about baseball. Its deeper. Its almost like a religion. Its family, really. Its crazy. I get emotional thinking about it. I dont know how to describe it. Its like, you know when they won? I dont think Boston fans were like, We got a trophy, or, We got a ring. They were like, I got to call my dad. Stuff like that. It was weird. Youd go past cemeteries and see like hats on the gravestones. Its like deep, man. Its beyond anything Ive experienced.
  Fallon and Barrymore Mingle With the Fans: They were extra nice, nicer than I could imagine. And you get to know everybody. The people in the stands werent actors around us. All during the games we had real fans in the seats. Pete and Bobby Farrelly said, Look, if you look in the camera, youre not going to be in the movie. And they were like, Yeah, yeah whatever.
  Cmon Manny. Lets go.
  The way we did it, it was real guerilla filmmaking. Pete and Bobby were like, Heres the deal. We do not want to disrupt the game at all in any way. We do not want to have anyone blame us for losing the game. So wed get direction by the beer and hot dog stand and then wed run in like guerilla filmmaking and sit down. Theyd film us saying, Really great game, or just cheering or singing Sweet Caroline.
  You got to know the same people. Hey Jimmy. How you doing pal? This is my son. And this is my mother. You became close. You meet the same people, the same fans. When we started they were like 10 ½ games out of first and of course in the script we didnt have it that the Red Sox win the World Series. If we did, that would be like bulls**t. Theyve lost for 86 years. All of sudden theyre gonna win? This really is a comedy.
  So then we were there and as we started shooting, they started winning. And we were like, What do we do if they win? And Boston fans were like, Dont worry about it. Well lose Pally. Dont have a heart attack. Ive done this for too long. Were not going to win. I dont care how many bloody socks they have. Were not going to win. So they started winning and we called [writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel] in a panic. I mean, we were excited. Dude, this could happen. It was just unbelievable. We were in shock. Then we got to go to the Series. Pete was like, Were going to put you guys on a plane. Youll make it there for the first inning. In case the Red Sox win, youve got to be there. Our movie is about a guy who loves the Red Sox.
  On the Sox Breaking the Curse and Winning the World Series: It couldnt have been more exciting, to me anyway. Its also a perfect ending to my movie. Its a Hollywood ending from the gods. I was in shock I was so happy. It was amazing.
  The Original Ending of Fever Pitch: The original ending is basically like the Nick Hornby book, which is a great book but its really sad. Its more of a memoir of how fans Its a love letter to the fans, which is why we picked the Red Sox because they lose. If you root for something that loses for 86 years, youre a pretty good fan. Win or lose. You dont have to win everything to be a fan of something. So the way it ended was that you have that realization about whats important in your life, my relationship with my team or my relationship with this girl. So I think the original ending was just we rip the contract up, or we dont really rip it up, then we kiss and the camera just cranes out. But then it cranes back in and they go to the season. So if they hadnt gone to the World Series, it would have probably just ended on that. Just them kissing on the field.
  PAGE 2: Jimmy Fallon on the Farrelly Bros and Leaving 'Saturday Night Live'
  The Heartbreak of St. Louis Fans: Actually there were a lot of Boston fans at that last game. People were like, Just give it to them. A lot of people are comparing it to the United States beating the Russians. Yeah we beat the Russians, but then we had to go on and beat Romania or something, Finland, to get the Gold. No one remembers that. But its like, We did it! That was the best Olympics ever!
  We beat the Russians! Yeah, but that wasnt the end. That wasnt what got us the Gold. So once after the Yankees, people just said, Whatever. Just go. Even the Yankee fans were like, Just give them one. Im tired of hearing it.
  Learning from the Farrelly Bros. and Drew Barrymore: Listening is more important than talking.
  And just hit your mark and believe what you say. Just listen to people and react to what they are saying.
  Drew [Barrymore] does it different almost every time. Shes awesome. She can do a scene where shes upset and theyll say, Just tone it down a little bit. And shell do it again and tone it down and not cry so much. Then theyll say go all the way and shell just goes all out. Holy mackerel! Its like you turn a knob going more. Its so impressive. I think this is the best Ive seen her in a movie, too. Im a big fan of Drew Barrymore but I thought she was fantastic in this movie. I watched it and I got right out of it. I didnt act like I was there. I just got into the story.
  Leaving After Six Years on SNL: The first couple of episodes, youve got to kind of wean yourself off.
  Six years I lived in a dorm at Rockefeller Center sleeping in the same office as Horatio [Sanz] and waking up there. You miss it so bad. Whenever Im around a TV set Ill watch it.

  Also known as: 'The Runaway Grandmother,' 'The Stolen Granny '
  A friend of mine knows a family who were on vacation, driving through some remote part of the country in their station wagon. They had brought Grandma along even though she was quite elderly and not feeling well, because her heart was set on going on this one last trip with her grandchildren, and they didn't want to disappoint her.
  Unfortunately, at some point during the long drive Grandma passed away in the back seat of the car. Her grandchildren, sitting on either side of her, became hysterical.
  Since they were several hours away from the nearest sizable city, the father did the only thing he could think of to remedy the situation. He wrapped Grandma's body in a thick blanket, secured it to the luggage rack on top of the station wagon, and drove on.
  When they finally reached the outskirts of civilization the father stopped at a service station and everyone clambered out of the car while he used a payphone to call authorities and report the death. Understandably nervous and upset, he didn't realize he had left the keys in the ignition.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  When the family went back to the car they found it had been stolen, along with all their possessions ... and Grandma.
  Analysis: If this story sounds familiar, that's no doubt because it's an exceedingly common FOAFtale (friend-of-a-friend tale) dating back (at least) to World War II. Folklorist Duncan Emrich reported a variant of it in his 1972 book Folklore on the American Land , and it has appeared in several collections of urban legends since.
  Or perhaps you recognize it as one of the more amusing subplots of the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation , or in Tom Robbins' 1971 novel Another Roadside Attraction .
  You may have even run across it in your local newspaper, written up as if it were a real-life occurrence.
  The Associated Press dispatched a brief item in December 1999, to cite one example, about an incident that supposedly happened in the former U.S.S.R. According to the article, a pair of Moldavan cousins living in Ukraine, both too poor to afford a funeral for their dead grandmother, rolled up her corpse in a carpet and strapped it to the top of their car to be taken home for burial.
  When the grieving cousins stopped for a meal at a restaurant in southern Ukraine, a gang of thieves made off with their car... and Grandma.
  Among the U.S. papers that ran this suspiciously familiar story was the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, where it appeared under the headline 'Thieves Take Rug – and Grandma's Corpse.'
  It caught the attention of Jan Harold Brunvand, Salt Lake City resident, professor emeritus at the University of Utah, and author of more than half a dozen books on urban legends, including the marvelous volume Too Good to Be True , published that same year.
  Brunvand fired off a letter to the Deseret News . 'Oh, come on, editor!' it began. 'Surely you didn't believe that AP story you published on Page A14 of the Dec. 9 Deseret News about the missing Moldavan granny. This is nothing but the old 'Runaway Grandmother' urban legend that has been told worldwide for decades.'
  As a matter of fact, he scolded, in 1987 the legend had appeared in the Deseret News itself, in one of Brunvand's own weekly columns, entitled 'Grandma's Fit to Be Tied — to the Luggage Rack.'
  Did the Associated Press and Deseret News bite on an old urban legend? According to Jan Harold Brunvand, they did. Some stories, like this one, really are 'too good to be true.'

"Skylab","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Japanese-Whaling-Crew-Eaten-Alive-by-Killer-Whales.htm","2015-05-16 21:44:57","  By Jennifer Rosenberg
  Skylab was America’s first space station. Launched unmanned on May 14, 1973 from the Kennedy Space Center, Skylab was built and supplied to hold three separate crews of three astronauts over the course of seven months. However, the whole program was nearly ruined when the micrometeoroid shield broke off during launch and damaged other parts of the Skylab.
  The combined teamwork of scientists on the ground and astronauts aboard Skylab were able to not only save the Skylab, but make it an all-around success. Scientific and medical experiments conducted on Skylab greatly added to our knowledge of living in space, the creation of alloys in a non-gravity environment, the planet Earth, and the Sun. Skylab fell from the sky as space debris on July 11, 1979.
  In the race to space, the United States was behind. Although the U.S. was the first to have a man walk on the Moon , they were second to the Russians for sending the first animal into orbit , the first man to space , and for creating the first space station.

  10 Best Universities in the United States
  In 1971, the Russians had launched Salyut 1 , the world's first space station. The success of Salyut 1 was dimmed, however, when its first crew had to go home early because they were unable to enter Salyut and its second crew, who had spent 23 days in space, died during re-entry.
  While the Russians were working to build Salyut 2 , the United States began working on their own space station -- Skylab,  Lacking funding, NASA decided to use leftover, unused parts from its lunar missions to create Skylab. (Scientists, however, did add many new features needed for a longer-term stay in space.)
  Officially part of the Apollo program, Skylab was a relatively large, cylindrical structure, 118 feet long (36 meters) and 22 feet in diameter (6.7 meters). It had two, huge solar-panel wings and even more solar panels along a windmill-looking tail.The Skylab cluster, as it was often called by scientists, consisted of five main sections:
  While the finishing touches were being put on Skylab, the Russians finished Salyut 2 first. On April 3, 1973, Salyut 2 was launched into space. The Russians' haste, however, proved to be their downfall. Just days after the unmanned Salyut 2 reached orbit, an explosion wrecked the space station.
  On May 14, 1973, just six weeks after Salyut 2's launch, Skylab was ready. The Skylab, minus the CSM, had been loaded onto a Saturn V rocket and placed onto Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. At 1:30 p.m. on May 14, 1973, the unmanned Skylab launched. At first, everything seemed to be going smoothly, but that didn’t last long.
  At 63 seconds after initial launch, unexpected readings began to appear at Mission Control. Something had gone very wrong.
  After much research, it was discovered that the micrometeoroid shield had broken off and gotten tangled in the workshop’s solar-panel wings. Ultimately, the shield broke off one solar wing and prevented the other from fully deploying. This caused two major problems: the workshop was getting severely overheated and there wasn’t enough solar power to operate all of the Skylab’s controls.
  The micrometeoroid shield was an aluminum structure that was supposed to pop up along the exterior of the workshop in order to shield that area from both heat from the Sun and fast-moving but small meteoroids. When the micrometeoroid shield broke off, it exposed the workshop, where the crew was supposed to live and work, directly to the Sun’s rays, causing the exterior of the workshop to overheat by 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Since the first crew of Skylab was supposed to launch in the CSM just a day after Skylab, this had to be delayed. The first crew’s launch was postponed ten days – not a lot of time for scientists to figure out how to solve this major problem.
  Scientists from around the country worked diligently to come up with a plan. They needed to find a workable solution that could be made, tested, and packed within this tight time-frame. Several ideas were considered with just two ultimately chosen.
  The plan was that the first crew would place an umbrella-like shade over the workshop and then the second crew would place a more elaborate shade over the workshop using poles and fabric.
  It was a massive effort to get this plan to work, but the teamwork between scientists on the ground and astronauts in space proved that even major repairs could be done in space. This became a staple for the Skylab as over 150 different things unexpectedly needed fixing during the Skylab’s tenure.
  As with Russia's Salyut 1 and 2, the plan was to send a fully functional space station into orbit and then have crews come meet it in space. For Skylab, three separate crews were to live on Skylab, with a 60 day wait in between. Each of  these crews consisted of a commander, a pilot, and a scientist pilot.
  Originally, the first crew was to spend 28 days on Skylab, crew two to spend 56 days, and crew three to spend 56 days. However, the crews were doing so well in space that crew two and three's stays were lengthened to a total of 59 and 84 days, respectively.
  Ultimately, these crews spent between four to twelve weeks living in space, without gravity, in a small compartment. Simple things that most of us take for granted had to be re-thought and re-designed by scientists to make these longer stays possible.
  Scientists, working with a limited budget, needed to build Skylab cheaply, sturdily, and comfortably. They needed to think through how and where the astronauts would work, eat, sleep, exercise, and relax. Without gravity and without a distinct up or down orientation, many of the simplest, everyday actions become logistically difficult.
  Take showering, for example. Drops of water in space would just float around.the space station and land on electrical equipment. Scientists had to engineer a shower that would prevent this from happening but still allow the astronauts to clean themselves. The result was a retractable tube that an astronaut could slide into, with water that was directed by forced air flow.
  Food was another concern. Tubes of liquid food, used in previous shorter flights, was considered unappetizing for a longer stay in space. Scientists worked hard to diversify the astronauts' food and provided dried, frozen, and canned food. (To prevent silverware from floating around the cabin, engineers attached them to a table via magnets.)
  Storing trash was another issue – you wouldn’t want that floating around the Skylab for seven months. Scientists also developed a bathroom system that could freeze urine and dry fecal matter so that medical specialists back on Earth could learn from it.
  Interestingly, even astronauts simply speaking to each other would be difficult because the thin atmosphere only let sound travel a few feet.
  Living on a space station was in no way a vacation. Scientists back on Earth had many questions they wanted answered and so had planned about 100 scientific experiments for the astronauts to conduct while in space. These experiments were wide in scope but can be divided into five categories:
  Information gained from the Skylab mission has been indispensable, including the 40,000 pictures taken of the Earth and 182,000 pictures of the Sun.
  The Skylab, although plagued by problems, far exceeded what scientists hoped to accomplish with it. It completed 3,900 orbits around the Earth and carried crew for 171 days while traveling 70.5 million miles, from the day it was launched until the third crew left.
  When crew three left Skylab on February 8, 1974, NASA still had hopes that it would eventually send another crew someday. However, time went by, funding was cut, and everyone began to focus on the space shuttle project instead. The Skylab, once a symbol of the future, became just another piece of neglected space debris orbiting the Earth.
  Then, in 1978, it became apparent that the Skylab’s orbit was deteriorating faster than expected. Unfortunately, the scientists that had worked so diligently to build the space station and get it into space had neglected to create a way to get the Skylab back down to Earth again.
  On July 11, 1979, the 77-ton Skylab re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. Scientists had tried to maneuver the Skylab so that its debris would land in the Indian Ocean. Unfortunately, a math miscalculation caused only some of the debris to land in the ocean – the rest landed in a sparsely populated area of Western Australia. Thankfully, no one was hurt.

  The man responsible for operating the Olympic Rings during last night’s Winter Olympic Opening Ceremonies in Russia was found dead today.
  According to local reports the body of T. Borris Avdeyev was found his hotel room early this morning with multiple stab wounds.
  Avdeyev was a technical specialist responsible for the Olympic Ring spectacle, which embarrassingly malfunctioned last night. Five animatronic snowflakes were supposed to transform into Olympic Rings. The first four functioned properly but the fifth snowflake failed to change shape.
  Although his body was badly mangled and the wounds were consistent with a struggle, so far officials say they don't suspect foul play.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: There was indeed an Olympic ring 'mishap' during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia ( per a report from the BBC ), but as of this writing no specific person has been blamed for the technical malfunction, let alone found dead of injuries 'consistent with a struggle' in his hotel room. (Update: Creative director Konstantin Ernst is considered the one ultimately responsibility for the production, but, as The Telegraph noted the day after the opening ceremony, Ernst is a close friend of President Vladimir Putin and probably needn't fear being 'transported to the icy wastes of Siberia' or otherwise punished.)
  The viral story claiming a technician was found dead under suspicious circumstances in connection with the ring debacle is a spoof published by The Daily Currant , a U.S.-based satire website with a history of confusing uncritical readers with fabricated 'news.'

  Well if he didn’t before I’m sure he does now. Michael Vick was hospitalized in a pit bull attack in downtown Philadelphia this morning. When police investigated the scene they found at least 3 other pit bulls in cages although it didn’t appear that the dogs had been used for fighting.
  While the police technically can’t charge Vick with dog-fighting (again), we feel he might have learned his lesson this time around. Apparently, one of the dogs got out of it’s cage and went on a rampage, hospitalizing 7 people including of course Michael Vick.
  - Full Article -
  Analysis: Pure fiction. This story was originally published on the satirical website Empire Sports , which specializes in lampooning well-known sports figures. There have been no reports in legitimate news sources of Michael Vick being attacked by a dog.
  The spoof references Michael Vick's real-life troubles resulting from his involvement in dog fighting when he was with the Atlanta Falcons in 2007. Vick was indicted, pled guilty, and served 19 months in prison plus two months under house arrest.
  Update: The same premise was used again in an almost identical hoax published on the fake news website NewsNerd.com in March 2014: ' Michael Vick Attacked By Stray Pitbull in New Jersey .'

  Texas Board of Education Revises Textbooks: Slaves were 'Unpaid Interns'
  DALLAS — The Texas Board of Education has drawn scrutiny in recent years for its efforts to revise its curriculum to favor more conservative-friendly versions of history and science. After revising textbooks last year to emphasize Christian influences on the Founding Fathers and introduce Intelligent Design to biology classes, the Board voted nine to zero today to change official nomenclature regarding slavery. In Texas, students will now be taught that slaves were not kidnapped and exploited against their will, but were actually 'unpaid interns.'
  'While African workers were not compensated monetarily,' the new curriculum guidelines acknowledge, 'by working outside picking cotton, they gained valuable career experience and were provided with ample networking opportunities.'

"Gerbilling Mishap Injures Two","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/fl/Gerbilling-Mishap-Injures-Two.htm","2016-03-27 19:52:48","  By David Emery
  Viral 'news story' claims two men were injured in a 'gerbilling' mishap involving a tiny rodent, a cardboard tube and an untimely-lit match.
  Description: Fake news Circulating since: 1993 Status: False
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader in 1997:
  Direct from the LA Times:
  'In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil,' Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. Tomaszewski, and his homosexual partner Andrew 'Kiki' Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong.
  'I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in,' he explained. 'As usual, Kiki shouted out 'Armageddon', my cue that he'd had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn't come out again,so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.'
  At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. 'The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tubing, igniting Mr Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.'
  Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: Albeit attributed to the Los Angeles Times , this lurid bit of potty humor did not originate in any newspaper. Neither the content nor the style conforms to even the lowest of journalistic standards. It's fake news, a joke, or more precisely a joke bordering on an urban legend , because people insist on claiming it's true. Variants of the story can be found in Internet message board postings dating back to 1993.
  I'm obliged to point out that the term 'felching' is, um, sorely misused in the text. It's an actual slang word that refers to a sexual activity, and that sexual activity has something to do with rectums, but nothing to do with gerbils. Rather than attempt to provide a clinically correct definition of the term, I will refer you to the Internet . The Internet knows more about felching than you likely will want to know yourself. Fair warning.
  The narrative does revolve around an instance of what some like to call 'gerbilling' (or 'gerbil stuffing'), which, simply defined, is — supposedly — the act of inserting a live rodent into one's own or another person's anus for sexual pleasure.
  I say 'supposedly' because despite the fact that a name for such a practice exists, there's no evidence that the practice itself does. Quite the opposite, in fact. 'Both in my professional and personal life, thousands of guys have freely admitted to doing the most out-there, dangerous, risky, stupid, kinky stuff,' sex advice columnist Dan Savage wrote in 1998 . 'But not once in all these years has anyone ever told me that he, or anyone he knows, or anyone anyone he knows knows, has ever put a gerbil in his ass. Like the doomed gerbils themselves, this story has no legs. It is an urban legend.'
  The best known gerbilling story in popular culture is, of course, the Richard Gere story , in which it's said that the actor was supposedly rushed to an L.A. emergency ward many years ago to have a stuck gerbil removed from his rectum. Virtually everyone in America, I'm tempted to say, knows somebody who knows somebody who claims to have been right there when Gere was admitted to the hospital, or knows the surgeon who performed the gerbilectomy, or a nurse who was sworn to secrecy.
  Although Gere has never out-and-out denied the story — and really, who would ever want to actually say the words, 'No I didn't put a gerbil in my butt' — he did once mention it in a magazine interview in which he said, 'I stopped reading the press a long time ago. Lots of crazy things came up about me at first, especially from the tabloids. There is an infamous 'Gere stuck a hamster up his bum' urban myth.'
  The man doesn't know a hamster from a gerbil. What are the odds he had an intimate encounter with either one?

  Example: Email contributed by Jason M., July 16, 2001:
  Report: President Bush Has Lowest IQ of All Presidents of Past 50 Years
  If late night TV comedy is an indicator, then there has never been as widespread a perception that a president is not intellectually qualified for the position he holds as there is with President GW Bush.
  In a report published Monday, the Lovenstein Institute of Scranton, Pennsylvania, detailed its findings of a four-month study of the intelligence quotient of President George W. Bush.
  Since 1973, the Lovenstein Institute has published its research to the education community on each new president, which includes the famous 'IQ' report among others.
  According to statements in the report, there have been twelve presidents over the past 50 years, from F. D. Roosevelt to G. W. Bush who were all rated based on scholarly achievements, writings that they alone produced without aid of staff, their ability to speak with clarity, and several other psychological factors which were then scored in the Swanson/Crain system of intelligence ranking.
  The study determined the following IQs of each president as accurate to within five percentage points:
  147 Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) 132 Harry Truman (D) 122 Dwight D. Eisenhower (R) 174 John F. Kennedy (D) 126 Lyndon B. Johnson (D) 155 Richard M. Nixon (R) 121 Gerald Ford (R) 175 James E. Carter (D) 105 Ronald Reagan (R) 098 George HW Bush (R) 182 William J. Clinton (D) 091 George W. Bush (R)
  The six Republican presidents of the past 50 years had an average IQ of 115.5, with President Nixon having the highest IQ, at 155.
  President G. W. Bush was rated the lowest of all the Republicans with an IQ of 91. The six Democrat presidents had IQs with an average of 156, with President Clinton having the highest IQ, at 182. President Lyndon B. Johnson was rated the lowest of all the Democrats with an IQ of 126.
  No president other than Carter (D) has released his actual IQ, 176.
  Among comments made concerning the specific testing of President G. W. Bush, his low ratings were due to his apparent difficulty to command the English language in public statements, his limited use of vocabulary (6,500 words for Bush versus an average of 11,000 words for other presidents), his lack of scholarly achievements other than a basic MBA, and an absence of any body of work which could be studied on an intellectual basis. The complete report documents the methods and procedures used to arrive at these ratings, including depth of sentence structure and voice stress confidence analysis.
  'All the Presidents prior to George W. Bush had a least one book under their belt, and most had written several white papers during their education or early careers. Not so with President Bush,' Dr. Lovenstein said. 'He has no published works or writings, so in many ways that made it more difficult to arrive at an assessment. We had to rely more heavily on transcripts of his unscripted public speaking.'
  The Lovenstein Institute of Scranton, Pennsylvania, think-tank includes high-caliber historians, psychiatrists, sociologists, scientists in human behavior, and psychologists. Among their ranks are Dr. Werner R. Lovenstein, world-renowned sociologist, and Professor Patricia F. Dilliams, a world-respected psychiatrist.
  This study was commissioned on February 13, 2001, and released on July 9, 2001, to subscribing member universities and organizations within the education community.
  Analysis: You'd think Americans would have grown weary of 'Bush is an idiot' jokes by now (Aug. 2001), but the popularity of this forwarded email suggests otherwise. It's obviously a work of satire. Even so, the text has frequently enough been cited as factual to generate heated, though undeserved, debate.
  I've found no evidence of the existence of a 'Lovenstein Institute' in Scranton, Pennsylvania or anywhere else. (UPDATE: Yes, I know there's a website purporting to be that of a real-life 'Lovenstein Institute,' but it was created well after the Bush IQ email first began circulating, and is equally bogus ). There is no trace to be found of a 'Dr. Werner R. Lovenstein, world-renowned sociologist' or 'Professor Patricia F. Dilliams, world-respected psychiatrist'  not in this world, at any rate. Every fact and figure in the message appears to have been fabricated. Some versions claim the text was originally published by the Associated Press, which is not the case.
  The true source of this work of fiction was www.linkydinky.com , which is home, appropriately enough, to a humor mailing list.
  Take the Poll : 'Would you be surprised to learn that G.W. Bush has a lower IQ than previous presidents?'

  Illegal Immigrants Forcibly Occupy Small Texas Town
  <National Report> (Sarita, Texas) – The Mexican border crisis has gone from bad to worse over night after a well-organized Hispanic militia sacked the small town of Sarita, Texas. Sarita is a quiet community, residing 90 miles west of the Gulf of Mexico. The city limits stretch for two miles along U.S. Route 77, and ending before Kingsville. The 2010 US Census states that the berg has a mere 284 residents.
  Sarita, TX has been recognized in the past for its leftist views. Business Insider ranked them “The Most Liberal City In Texas“. Some immigrants are said to have used this to their advantage, crossing the nearby border in the belief that Saritains would not report them to the Border Patrol. This tolerant mentality has proven to be a double edge sword, however, and one that could served to be their undoing.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: There's a reason this seeming bombshell of a story hasn't appeared on CNN, Fox News, USA Today , or the New York Times , namely that these sources report actual news, not fiction disguised as fact. The article originated on NationalReport.net , a site which currently carries no disclaimer but which used to feature a statement saying, 'All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news.'
  National Report's publisher, Allen Montgomery, takes open delight in tweaking the fears and anxieties of certain political groups, particularly those on the right. 'We have been targeting Tea Party types recently as they are the most gullible and are willing to spread misinformation across the internet with little/no research,' he told the Casper Star-Tribune in July 2013. “It is our opinion that if a person is too lazy to check for multiple references [or at least one other source] … and they spread misinformation around as fact, then they are to blame for their own stupidity, not us.'
  Bogus though the report of 'forcible occupation' may be, what gives it currency is the dramatic and very real increase in the number of illegal immigrants pouring into the U.S. from Central America during the first half of 2014, many of them unaccompanied children. The spike in border crossings has overwhelmed South Texas detention centers, according to mainstream press reports, prompting President Obama to declare a 'humanitarian crisis' and request emergency funding from Congress to cope with the problem.

  Text example: As shared on Facebook, Jan. 10, 2014:
  Snakegirl Attracts Crowds of Pilgrims and Tourists in Thailand 8-year-old Mai Li Fay, from Bangkok, is far from living the usual life of a girl her age. Everyday, thousands of people gather to the front of her family’s house to get a chance of seeing and possibly touching the young girl, a gesture which both buddhists and hindu pilgrims seem to perceive as a garantee of good fortune. According to the country’s top medical expert, Dr Ping Lao, the young girl suffers a very rare syndrome known as the Serpentosis Malianorcis or Jing Jing’s disease, which gives her lower body a distinct reptilian form and aspect. Only a handful of such cases have been recorded throughout history, so the scientific knowledge accumulated about the pathology is rather limited and there is no cure in sight at the moment.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: Unsurprisingly, a search of the U.S. Library of Medicine database yields no results for 'Serpentosis Malianorcis,' nor for 'Jing Jing's disease.' There is no such syndrome. Nor is there a 'top medical expert' in Thailand named Dr. Ping Lao.
  As for the article excerpted above, originally published Jan. 6, 2014 on a satire website whose previous stories include ' Dead Cow Brought Back to Life by Lightning Bolt ' and ' U.S. Donut Reserve Running Low ,' it's a complete fabrication.
  The photo is fabricated as well, though it's been circulating a few years longer. It appeared in several compilations of 'Worst Photoshop Fails' in 2013, and before that in an Oct. 26, 2011 message board post containing 30 more snake-girl hybrid photos just like it.

  A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.
  This particular fictional story appears to be very loosely based on 2011 news reports about Colton Burpo, a 4-year-old in Nebraska who told his parents after recovering from a near-death experience that he had seen Jesus and 'streets of gold' in heaven, not to mention long-dead relatives he had never met.

"The Hindenburg","http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/hindenburg.htm","2016-01-26 16:52:20","  In 1936, the Zeppelin Company, with the financial aid of Nazi Germany , built the Hindenburg (the LZ 129 ), the largest airship ever made. Named after the late German president, Paul von Hindenburg , the Hindenburg stretched 804-feet-long and was 135-feet-tall at its widest point. That made the Hindenburg just 78-feet shorter than the Titanic and four times larger than the Good Year blimps.
  The Hindenburg was a rigid airship definitely in the Zeppelin design. It had a gas capacity of 7,062,100 cubic feet and was powered by four 1,100-horsepower diesel engines.
  Although it had been built for helium (a less flammable gas than hydrogen), the United States had refused to export helium to Germany (for fear of other countries building military airships). Thus, the Hindenburg was filled with hydrogen in its 16 gas cells.
  On the outside of the Hindenburg , two large, black swastikas on a white circle surrounded by a red rectangle (the Nazi emblem) were emblazoned on two tail fins.
  continue reading below our video
  What are the Seven Wonders of the World
  Also on the outside of the Hindenburg was 'D-LZ129' painted in black and the airship's name, 'hindenburg' painted in scarlet, Gothic script.
  For its appearance at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin in August, the Olympic rings were painted on the side of the Hindenburg .
  The inside of the Hindenburg surpassed all other airships in luxury. Though most of the airship's interior consisted of gas cells, there were two decks (just aft of the control gondola) for the passengers and crew. These decks spanned the width (but not the length) of the Hindenburg .
  Deck A (the top deck) offered a promenade and a lounge on each side of the airship which was nearly walled with windows (which opened), allowing passengers to watch the scenery throughout their trip. In each of these rooms, passengers could sit on chairs made of aluminum. The lounge even featured a baby grand piano that was made of aluminum and covered in yellow pigskin, weighing only 377 pounds.
  Between the promenade and the lounge were the passenger cabins. Each cabin had two berths and a washbasin, similar in design to a sleeping room on a train. But in order to keep weight to a minimum, the passenger cabins were separated with only a single layer of foam covered by fabric. Toilets, urinals, and one shower could be found downstairs, on Deck B.
  The Hindenburg , a giant in size and grandeur, first emerged from its shed in Friedrichshafen, Germany on March 4, 1936. After only a few test flights, the Hindenburg was ordered by the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr. Joseph Goebbels , to accompany the Graf Zeppelin over every German city with a population over 100,000 to drop Nazi campaign pamphlets and to blare patriotic music from loudspeakers. The Hindenburg's first real trip was as a symbol of the Nazi regime.
  On May 6, 1936, the Hindenburg initiated its first scheduled transatlantic flight from Europe to the United States.

"Did a Study Show that Staring at Breasts Is Good for Men's Health?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/ogling_breasts.htm","2016-01-17 02:33:43","  By David Emery
  'Medical study' supposedly published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims staring at women's breasts every day is good for men's health.
  Description: Satire / Email hoax Circulating since: March / April 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader in April 2000:

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: Don't get your hopes up, guys. No such study was ever published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( check for yourself ).
  A search of the thousands of peer-reviewed articles contained in the National Institutes of Health medical journal database turns up zero items documenting the health benefits of staring at women's breasts, and, for that matter, zero items authored by 'Dr. Karen Weatherby' (who does not exist, so far as I can tell).
  If the story smacks of supermarket tabloid faux-journalism, well, that's precisely what it is. The text first hit the Internet in March or April 2000, mere weeks after a strikingly similar article appeared in the consistently misinformative Weekly World News (nor is this the first time we've encountered baseless Internet rumors traceable to precisely that source). A slightly different version had already appeared in the May 13, 1997 issue of the tabloid.
  A fresh round of breast-staring mania overtook the Internet in March 2011, when Fox News republished the story before checking the facts.
  It showed up again a few months later on the Scottish news site Daily Record & Sunday Mail : ' Doctors Say Looking at Busty Women for 10 Minutes a Day is Good for Your Health .'
  It goes without saying (I hope) that it's unwise to take medical advice from tabloid 'news' stories, still less from forwarded emails. Males who wish to increase their lifespans ought to consider practicing common sense as an alternative — it's more likely to achieve the desired result than any amount of public breast ogling.
  Admittedly, I don't have any medical research to back that up. Volunteers?

A Guide to Fake News Websites","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Jockey-Accidentally-Euthanized-After-Breaking-Leg.htm","2017-01-02 19:53:46","  Satire is a venerable form of social commentary that uses humor to ridicule human vices and follies. The Internet is rife with it, especially news satire , or fake news, in which fictionalized accounts of current events are presented in mock-journalistic style to lampoon politicians, celebrities, and social mores .
  Satire is only effective if people recognize it as such, however, and therein lies a major pitfall of publishing fake news on the Internet. Users tend to skim texts instead of reading them, missing important clues and disclaimers. The mechanics of social sharing obscure the origin and aim of viral content, increasing the likelihood that fiction will be mistaken for, or purposely misrepresented as, fact.
  Below is a checklist of the most popular fake news sites on the web. Share as needed!
  Andy Borowitz is a genuinely funny humorist and best-selling author whose satirical news column, The Borowitz Report , debuted in 2001 and is currently hosted by NewYorker.com. Most of his columns are literally too hilarious to be believed, yet some people insist on doing so. More »

'Heck we tend to leave in spelling and grammer errors just to prove we is not the professional media.' More »

  This spin-off of the Empire Sports website (see next entry below) brings a similar warped sensibility and star-struck emphasis to general 'news' of the day. Empire News describes itself as a 'satirical and entertainment website.' Don't believe anything you read there. More »
  This site specializes in lampooning sports and sports celebrities. It originally carried no satire disclaimer per se, but the phrase ' News Satire ' was visible on the top navigation bar of every page. With headlines like 'Dog Killing Debuts As New Sport In 2014 Winter Olympics,' there's no mistaking this site's content for actual news. More »
  Free Wood Post offers social and political spoofs from a liberal point of view, mercilessly skewering right-wing politics and politicians, as well as the occasional out-of-control sports figure or self-indulgent Hollywood celebrity. From its disclaimer page : 'Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.' More »
  This site isn't really satirical, nor is it particularly funny. Fake news stories with a Global Associated News masthead are generated by ordinary folks via the prank website FakeAWish.com . Fill in a celebrity's name, and out pops a boilerplate article claiming he or she was maimed or killed in some horrific accident. Strange as it seems, these hoaxes consistently fool people. A lot of people. More »
  'About Us: Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.' (If that statement makes sense to you, there's a chance you'll actually find this fake news site funny and entertaining. Otherwise, I doubt it.) I have yet to see anything that qualifies as 'real news' anywhere on the site. More »
  This Canada-centric site also lampoons U.S. and world events, and, truth be told, just about everything else that can possibly be made fun of.

Not biting social commentary, exactly, but often entertaining. More »
  This site credits itself with doing 'media criticism through satire,' though its articles are neither pithy nor funny. To date, MediaMass remains best known for running boilerplate stories pre-emptively dismissing celebrity death reports as hoaxes, even when those reports have been accurate. This is the very opposite of a reliable source. More »
  National Report burst on the scene in 2013 with a take-no-prisoners approach to political satire. Its content seems calculated more to push readers' buttons than to make them laugh, which may explain why it's often mistaken for real news by the very folks whose views it aims to skewer. Fortunately, as of Feb. 2014 NationalReport.net had reinstated its now-you-see-it-now-you-don't disclaimer page identifying the site as satirical. Don't be fooled! More »
  Here's another site that takes a no-holds-barred approach to making up the news. Its disclaimer page states that some of site's content is satirical, but I've found nothing on it that looks like actual news. Many of the articles, in fact, appear to based on long-debunked Internet rumors and hoaxes. Don't be tempted to take this site seriously. More »
  'Reporting what the mainstream media won't tell you,' reads the tagline of this website — and for good reason. The Racket Report's articles 'may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways,' says its About Us page . 'That means some stories on this website are fictitious.' Some stories? I have looked in vain for any non-fictitious content on the site. There is none. More »
  This site's owners aren't coy about what they're up to. 'All items on this website are fictitious,' says the disclaimer on every page. With a name like 'The Spoof,' you'd think there could be no doubt, but this is, after all, the Internet. Stories here are 100% reader-submitted and range from laugh-out-loud funny to just plain dumb.

  Noteworthy for such preposterous headlines as 'Dead Cow Brought Back to Life by Lightning' and 'Kentucky Man Sentenced to 235,451 Years in Jail,' this tabloid-style site emphasizes the 'faux' in faux journalism. The disclaimer page states: 'All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.'

"Child Witnesses Honest, But Less Reliable","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/a/baby_names.htm","2016-08-29 07:12:38","  By Charles Montaldo
  Children testifying in court are perceived to be more honest than adults, but their limited memory, communication skills, and greater suggestibility may make them less reliable witnesses than adults.
  The multi-disciplinary researc h, the first of its kind to examine judges' perceptions of child witnesses, was led by Queen's University Child and Family Law scholar Nick Bala. It addresses how judges assess the honesty and reliability of children's court testimony, and how accurate their observations are. It also makes recommendations for how to train child protection professionals and judges to most effectively frame their questions to child witnesses.
  The research has important implications for educating child-protection professionals, including judges.
  The findings are based on two related studies that merge traditional legal scholarship on children's truth telling, and a national survey of child-protection professionals that assesses perceptions of child witnesses and truth telling, with judges' responses to mock interviews.
  'Assessing the credibility of witnesses; deciding how much to rely on their testimony; is central to the trial process,' says Bala. 'The assessment of credibility is an inherently human and imprecise enterprise.“
  The research showed that social workers, other professionals working in child protection, and judges correctly identify children who are lying at only slightly above chance levels after watching mock interviews . Judges perform comparably to other justice system officials and significantly better than law students.
  Children Face Disadvantages
  While the mock interviews don't replicate the judge's courtroom experience, 'the results show that judges are not human lie detectors,' says Bala.
  The research also indicates that defense lawyers are more likely than prosecutors or others who work in the court system to ask children questions that are not appropriate to their developmental level. These questions use vocabulary, grammar or concepts that children could not reasonably be expected to understand. This leaves child witnesses at a disadvantage to respond honestly .
  Less Likely to Deceive
  The survey asked Canadian judges about their perceptions of child and adult witnesses on such issues as suggestibility, leading questions, memory, and perceptions of honesty in child witnesses. It found that children are perceived as:
  According to psychological research, Bala summarizes that a child's memory improves with age. For example, at age four, children can accurately describe what happened to them as far back as two years. Also, even though older children and adults have better memories, they are more likely to give inaccurate information when recalling past events compared younger children.
  Bala's research also suggests that children and adults provide more details when asked specific questioned rather than open-ended questions. However, children usually try to answer these types of questions, by giving answers to the parts of the question that they understand . When this occurs, the child's answers could seem misleading.
  Using this knowledge to refine techniques when questioning children can help improve the accuracy and completeness of a child's answer. Bala says such techniques include, 'showing warmth and support to children, mimicking the vocabulary of the child, avoiding legal jargon, confirming meanings of words with children, limiting the use of yes/no questions and avoiding of abstract conceptual questions.'
  It is also interesting to point out that when older children are repeatedly asked about an event, they tend to try to improve their description or provide additional information. However, younger children often assume being asked the same question means that their answer was wrong, so they sometimes change their answer entirely.
  Funded by The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the research suggests that all new judges should be trained in how children should be questioned, and about the types of questions that children should be able to understand.
  Effective communication with children and developmentally appropriate questions which children can reasonably be expected to answer makes them far more reliable witnesses.
  To minimize the deterioration in children's memories, the delay between the reporting of an offense and the trial should be shortened, the study also recommends. Several meetings between a child witness and the prosecutor before testifying will also help minimize a child's anxiety, the study notes.

"No, the KKK Didn't Start an Online Petition to 'Purge' African Americans","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/KKK-Starts-Online-Petition-for-Yearly-Purge.htm","2016-01-15 01:41:43","  Description: Fake news / Satire Circulating since: July 2014 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Via CreamBMP.com, July 24, 2014:
  KKK Wants Permission for a Yearly 'Purge' (Guilt Free Murdering) of All African Americans People
  CHANGE.ORG — “Its obvious many of our blue-blooded white Americans agree with our notion to make the African American race extinct” Said a Klan leader who was part of the social media effort to push the petition on website Change.org
  The KKK started an online petition to ‘Purge’ — Kill African Americans yearly that has reached over two million signatures and is growing by the second.
  Analysis: Did you see any of this reported on CNN? CBS News? Fox News? No, you didn't. Because it wasn't. The source of this 100% fictional story is Cream BMP , a humor website that describes itself as a purveyor of 'satire and parody of current news and urban culture.' Nothing on the site qualifies as real news.
  Moreover, Change.org, the political activism site on which the above-mentioned 'African American Purge' petition is purportedly hosted, tends to skew toward left-leaning issues and, historically, has been no friend of the Ku Klux Klan. In point of fact, the only petitions you will find on the Change.org website pertaining to the KKK take emphatic stands against the organization and all its activities.
  The idea of a 'purge' -- supposedly an annual event during which violent crime against particular groups (or all groups) is officially sanctioned -- comes from the 2013 movie The Purge and its 2014 sequel The Purge 2: Anarchy . The films are set in a dystopic future society which deals with social problems by permitting its citizens to assault and murder one another without guilt or punishment one night every year.
  It's a crazy-stupid idea and, as you might expect, things don't go so well for the main characters in these movies.

"Nelson Mandela","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Kanye-West-I-Am-The-Next-Nelson-Mandela.htm","2015-07-18 15:19:13","  Nelson Mandela was elected the first black president of South Africa in 1994, following the first multiracial election in South Africa's history. Mandela was imprisoned from 1962 to 1990 for his role in fighting apartheid policies established by the ruling white minority. Revered by his people as a national symbol of the struggle for equality, Mandela is considered one of the 20th century's most influential political figures. He and South African Prime Minister F.W. de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for their role in dismantling the apartheid system.
  Dates: July 18, 1918—December 5, 2013
  Also Known As: Rolihlahla Mandela, Madiba, Tata
  Famous quote: 'I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.'
  Nelson Rilihlahla Mandela was born in the village of Mveso, Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918 to Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa and Noqaphi Nosekeni, the third of Gadla's four wives.
  continue reading below our video
  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know
  In Mandela's native language, Xhosa , Rolihlahla meant 'troublemaker.' The surname Mandela came from one of his grandfathers.
  Mandela's father was a chief of the Thembu tribe in the Mvezo region, but served under the authority of the ruling British government. As a descendant of royalty, Mandela was expected to serve in his father's role when he came of age.
  But when Mandela was only an infant, his father rebelled against the British government by refusing a mandatory appearance before the British magistrate. For this, he was stripped of his chieftaincy and his wealth, and forced to leave his home. Mandela and his three sisters moved with their mother back to her home village of Qunu. There, the family lived in more modest circumstances.
  The family lived in mud huts and survived on the crops they grew and the cattle and sheep they raised. Mandela, along with the other village boys, worked herding sheep and cattle. He later recalled this as one of the happiest periods in his life. Many evenings, villagers sat around the fire, telling the children stories passed down through generations, of what life had been like before the white man had arrived.
  From the mid-17th century, Europeans (first the Dutch and later the British) had arrived on South African soil and gradually taken control from the native South African tribes. The discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa in the 19th century had only tightened the grip that Europeans had on the nation.
  By 1900, most of South Africa was under the control of Europeans. In 1910, the British colonies merged with the Boer (Dutch) republics to form the Union of South Africa, a part of the British Empire. Stripped of their homelands, many Africans were forced to work for white employers at low-paying jobs.
  Young Nelson Mandela, living in his small village, did not yet feel the impact of centuries of domination by the white minority.
  Although themselves uneducated, Mandela's parents wanted their son to go to school. At the age of seven, Mandela was enrolled in the local mission school. On the first day of class, each child was given an English first name; Rolihlahla was given the name 'Nelson.'
  When he was nine years old, Mandela's father died. According to his father's last wishes, Mandela was sent to live in the Thembu capital, Mqhekezeweni, where he could continue his education under the guidance of another tribal chief, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Upon first seeing the chief's estate, Mandela marveled at his large home and beautiful gardens.
  In Mqhekezeweni, Mandela attended another mission school and became a devout Methodist during his years with the Dalindyebo family. Mandela also attended tribal meetings with the chief, who taught him how a leader should conduct himself.
  When Mandela was 16, he was sent to a boarding school in a town several hundred miles away. Upon his graduation in 1937 at the age of 19, Mandela enrolled in Healdtown, a Methodist college. An accomplished student, Mandela also became active in boxing, soccer, and long-distance running.
  In 1939, after earning his certificate, Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts at the prestigious Fort Hare College, with a plan to ultimately attend law school. But Mandela did not complete his studies at Fort Hare; instead, he was expelled after participating in a student protest. He returned to the home of Chief Dalindyebo, where he was met with anger and disappointment.
  Just weeks after his return home, Mandela received stunning news from the chief. Dalindyebo had arranged for both his son, Justice, and Nelson Mandela to marry women of his choosing. Neither young man would consent to an arranged marriage , so the two decided to flee to Johannesburg , the South African capital.
  Desperate for money to finance their trip, Mandela and Justice stole two of the chief's oxen and sold them for train fare.
  Arriving in Johannesburg in 1940, Mandela found the bustling city an exciting place. Soon, however, he was awakened to the injustice of the black man's life in South Africa. Prior to moving to the capital, Mandela had lived mainly among other blacks. But in Johannesburg, he saw the disparity between the races. Black residents lived in slum-like townships that had no electricity or running water; while whites lived grandly off the wealth of the gold mines.
  Mandela moved in with a cousin and quickly found a job as a security guard. He was soon fired when his employers learned about his theft of the oxen and his escape from his benefactor.
  Mandela's luck changed when he was introduced to Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal-minded white lawyer. After learning of Mandela's desire to become an attorney, Sidelsky, who ran a large law firm serving both blacks and whites, offered to let Mandela work for him as a law clerk. Mandela gratefully accepted and took on the job at the age of 23, even as he worked to finish his BA via correspondence course.
  Mandela rented a room in one of the local black townships. He studied by candlelight each night and often walked the six miles to work and back because he lacked bus fare. Sidelsky supplied him with an old suit, which Mandela patched up and wore nearly every day for five years.
  In 1942, Mandela finally completed his BA and enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand as a part-time law student. At 'Wits,' he met several people who would work with him in the years to come for the cause of liberation.
  In 1943, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) , an organization that worked to improve conditions for blacks in South Africa. That same year, Mandela marched in a successful bus boycott staged by thousands of residents of Johannesburg in protest of high bus fares.
  As he grew more infuriated by racial inequalities, Mandela deepened his commitment to the struggle for liberation. He helped to form the Youth League , which sought to recruit younger members and transform the ANC into a more militant organization, one that would fight for equal rights. Under laws of the time, Africans were forbidden from owning land or houses in the towns, their wages were five times lower than those of whites, and none could vote.
  In 1944, Mandela, 26, married nurse Evelyn Mase , 22, and they moved into a small rental home. The couple had a son, Madiba ('Thembi'), in February 1945, and a daughter, Makaziwe, in 1947. Their daughter died of meningitis as an infant. They welcomed another son, Makgatho, in 1950, and a second daughter, named Makaziwe after her late sister, in 1954.
  Following the general elections of 1948 in which the white National Party claimed victory, the party's first official act was to establish apartheid. With this act, the long-held, haphazard system of segregation in South Africa became a formal, institutionalized policy, supported by laws and regulations.
  The new policy would even determine, by race, which parts of town each group could live in. Blacks and whites were to be separated from each other in all aspects of life, including public transportation, in theaters and restaurants, and even on beaches.
  Mandela completed his law studies in 1952 and, with partner Oliver Tambo, opened the first black law practice in Johannesburg. The practice was busy from the start. Clients included Africans who suffered the injustices of racism, such as seizure of property by whites and beatings by the police. Despite facing hostility from white judges and lawyers, Mandela was a successful attorney. He had a dramatic, impassioned style in the courtroom.
  During the 1950s, Mandela became more actively involved with the protest movement. He was elected president of the ANC Youth League in 1950. In June 1952, the ANC, along with Indians and 'colored' (biracial) people—two other groups also targeted by discriminatory laws—began a period of nonviolent protest known as the 'Defiance Campaign.' Mandela spearheaded the campaign by recruiting, training, and organizing volunteers.
  The campaign lasted six months, with cities and towns throughout South Africa participating. Volunteers defied the laws by entering areas meant for whites only. Several thousand were arrested in that six-month time, including Mandela and other ANC leaders. He and the other members of the group were found guilty of 'statutory communism' and sentenced to nine months of hard labor, but the sentence was suspended.
  The publicity garnered during the Defiance Campaign helped membership in the ANC soar to 100,000.
  The government twice 'banned' Mandela, meaning that he could not attend public meetings, or even family gatherings, because of his involvement in the ANC. His 1953 banning lasted two years.
  Mandela, along with others on the executive committee of the ANC, drew up the Freedom Charter in June 1955 and presented it during a special meeting called the Congress of the People. The charter called for equal rights for all, regardless of race, and the ability of all citizens to vote, own land, and hold decent-paying jobs. In essence, the charter called for a non-racial South Africa.
  Months after the charter was presented, police raided the homes of hundreds of members of the ANC and arrested them. Mandela and 155 others were charged with high treason. They were released to await a trial date.
  Mandela's marriage to Evelyn suffered from the strain of his long absences; they divorced in 1957 after 13 years of marriage. Through work, Mandela met Winnie Madikizela , a social worker who had sought his legal advice. They married in June 1958, just months before Mandela's trial began in August. Mandela was 39 years old, Winnie only 21. The trial would last three years; during that time, Winnie gave birth to two daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa.
  The trial, whose venue was changed to Pretoria, moved at a snail's pace. The preliminary arraignment alone took a year; the actual trial didn't start until August 1959. Charges were dropped against all but 30 of the accused. Then, on March 21, 1960, the trial was interrupted by a national crisis.
  In early March, another anti-apartheid group, the Pan African Congress (PAC) had held large demonstrations protesting strict 'pass laws,' which required Africans to carry identification papers with them at all times in order to be able to travel throughout the country. During one such protest in Sharpeville, police had opened fire on unarmed protestors, killing 69, and wounding more than 400. The shocking incident, which was universally condemned, was called the Sharpeville Massacre .
  Mandela and other ANC leaders called for a national day of mourning, along with a stay at home strike. Hundreds of thousands participated in a mostly peaceful demonstration, but some rioting erupted. The South African government declared a national state of emergency and martial law was enacted. Mandela and his co-defendants were moved into prison cells, and both the ANC and PAC were officially banned.
  The treason trial resumed on April 25, 1960 and lasted until March 29, 1961. To the surprise of many, the court dropped charges against all of the defendants, citing a lack of evidence proving that the defendants had planned to violently overthrow the government.
  For many, it was cause for celebration, but Nelson Mandela had no time to celebrate. He was about to enter into a new—and dangerous—chapter in his life.
  Prior to the verdict, the banned ANC had held an illegal meeting and decided that if Mandela was acquitted, he would go underground after the trial. He would operate clandestinely to give speeches and gather support for the liberation movement. A new organization, the National Action Council (NAC), was formed and Mandela named as its leader.
  In accordance with the ANC plan, Mandela became a fugitive directly after the trial. He went into hiding at the first of several safe houses, most of them located in the Johannesburg area. Mandela stayed on the move, knowing that the police were looking everywhere for him.
  Venturing out only at night, when he felt safest, Mandela dressed in disguises, such as a chauffeur or a chef. He made unannounced appearances, giving speeches at places that were presumed safe, and also made radio broadcasts. The press took to calling him 'the Black Pimpernel,' after the title character in the novel The Scarlet Pimpernel.
  In October 1961, Mandela moved to a farm in Rivonia, outside of Johannesburg. He was safe for a time there and could even enjoy visits from Winnie and their daughters.
  In response to the government's increasingly violent treatment of protestors, Mandela developed a new arm of the ANC—a military unit that he named 'Spear of the Nation,' known also as MK. The MK would operate using a strategy of sabotage, targeting military installations, power facilities, and transportation links. Its goal was to damage property of the state, but not to harm individuals.
  The MK's first attack came in December 1961, when they bombed an electric power station and empty government offices in Johannesburg. Weeks later, another set of bombings were carried out. White South Africans were startled into the realization that they could no longer take their safety for granted.
  In January 1962, Mandela, who had never in his life been out of South Africa, was smuggled out of the country to attend a Pan-African conference. He hoped to get financial and military support from other African nations, but was not successful. In Ethiopia, Mandela received training in how to fire a gun and how to build small explosives.
  After 16 months on the run, Mandela was captured on August 5, 1962, when the car he was driving was overtaken by police. He was arrested on charges of leaving the country illegally and inciting a strike. The trial began on October 15, 1962.
  Refusing counsel, Mandela spoke on his own behalf. He used his time in court to denounce the government's immoral, discriminatory policies. Despite his impassioned speech, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Mandela was 44 years old when he entered Pretoria Local Prison.
  Imprisoned in Pretoria for six months, Mandela was then taken to Robben Island, a bleak, isolated prison off the coast of Cape Town, in May 1963. After only a few weeks there, Mandela learned he was about to head back to court—this time on charges of sabotage. He would be charged along with several other members of MK, who had been arrested on the farm in Rivonia.
  During the trial, Mandela admitted his role in the formation of MK. He emphasized his belief that the protestors were only working toward what they deserved—equal political rights. Mandela concluded his statement by saying that he was prepared to die for his cause.
  Mandela and his seven co-defendants received guilty verdicts on June 11, 1964. They could have been sentenced to death for so serious a charge, but each was given life imprisonment. All of the men (except one white prisoner) were sent to Robben Island .
  At Robben Island, each prisoner had a small cell with a single light that stayed on 24 hours a day. Prisoners slept on the floor upon a thin mat. Meals consisted of cold porridge and an occasional vegetable or piece of meat (although Indian and Asian prisoners received more generous rations than their black counterparts.) As a reminder of their lower status, black prisoners wore short pants all year-round, whereas others were allowed to wear trousers.
  Inmates spent nearly ten hours a day at hard labor, digging out rocks from a limestone quarry.
  The hardships of prison life made it difficult to maintain one's dignity, but Mandela resolved not to be defeated by his imprisonment. He became the spokesperson and leader of the group, and was known by his clan name, 'Madiba.'
  Over the years, Mandela led the prisoners in numerous protests—hunger strikes, food boycotts, and work slowdowns. He also demanded reading and study privileges. In most cases, the protests eventually yielded results.
  Mandela suffered personal losses during his imprisonment. His mother died in January 1968 and his 25-year-old son Thembi died in a car accident the following year. A heartbroken Mandela was not allowed to attend either funeral.
  In 1969, Mandela received word that his wife Winnie had been arrested on charges of communist activities. She spent 18 months in solitary confinement and was subjected to torture. The knowledge that Winnie had been imprisoned caused Mandela great distress.
  Throughout his imprisonment, Mandela remained the symbol of the anti-apartheid movement, still inspiring his countrymen. Following a 'Free Mandela' campaign in 1980 that attracted global attention, the government capitulated somewhat. In April 1982, Mandela and four other Rivonia prisoners were transferred to Pollsmoor Prison on the mainland. Mandela was 62 years old and had been at Robben Island for 19 years.
  Conditions were much improved from those at Robben Island. Inmates were allowed to read newspapers, watch TV, and receive visitors. Mandela was given a lot of publicity, as the government wanted to prove to the world that he was being treated well.
  In an effort to stem the violence and repair the failing economy, Prime Minister P.W. Botha announced on January 31, 1985 that he would release Nelson Mandela if Mandela agreed to renounce violent demonstrations. But Mandela refused any offer that was not unconditional.
  In December 1988, Mandela was transferred to a private residence at the Victor Verster prison outside Cape Town and later brought in for secret negotiations with the government. Little was accomplished, however, until Botha resigned from his position in August 1989, forced out by his cabinet. His successor, F.W. de Klerk , was ready to negotiate for peace. He was willing to meet with Mandela.
  At Mandela's urging, de Klerk released Mandela's fellow political prisoners without condition in October 1989. Mandela and de Klerk had long discussions about the illegal status of the ANC and other opposition groups, but came to no specific agreement. Then, on February 2, 1990, de Klerk made an announcement that stunned Mandela and all of South Africa.
  De Klerk enacted a number of sweeping reforms, lifting the bans on the ANC, the PAC, and the Communist Party, among others. He lifted the restrictions still in place from the 1986 state of emergency and ordered the release of all nonviolent political prisoners.
  On February 11, 1990, Nelson Mandela was given an unconditional release from prison. After 27 years in custody, he was a free man at the age of 71. Mandela was welcomed home by thousands of people cheering in the streets.
  Soon after his return home, Mandela learned that his wife Winnie had fallen in love with another man in his absence. The Mandelas separated in April 1992 and later divorced.
  Mandela knew that despite the impressive changes that had been made, there was still much work to be done. He returned immediately to working for the ANC, traveling across South Africa to speak with various groups and to serve as a negotiator for further reforms.
  In 1993, Mandela and de Klerk were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their joint effort to bring about peace in South Africa.
  On April 27, 1994, South Africa held its first election in which blacks were allowed to vote. The ANC won 63 percent of the votes, a majority in Parliament. Nelson Mandela—only four years after his release from prison—was elected the first black president of South Africa. Nearly three centuries of white domination had ended.
  Mandela visited many Western nations in an attempt to convince leaders to work with the new government in South Africa. He also made efforts to help bring about peace in several African nations, including Botswana, Uganda, and Libya. Mandela soon earned the admiration and respect of many outside of South Africa.
  During Mandela's term, he addressed the need for housing, running water, and electricity for all South Africans. The government also returned land to those it had been taken from, and made it legal again for blacks to own land.
  In 1998, Mandela married Graca Machel on his eightieth birthday. Machel, 52 years old, was the widow of a former president of Mozambique.
  Nelson Mandela did not seek re-election in 1999. He was replaced by his Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela retired to his mother's village of Qunu, Transkei.
  Mandela became involved in raising funds for HIV/AIDS , an epidemic in Africa. He organized the AIDS benefit '46664 Concert' in 2003, so named after his prison ID number. In 2005, Mandela's own son, Makgatho, died of AIDS at the age of 44.
  In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly designated July 18, Mandela's birthday, as Nelson Mandela International Day. Nelson Mandela died at his Johannesburg home on December 5, 2013 at the age of 95.

  Description: Joke / Urban legend Circulating since: 1998 / Earlier Status:  False (as written)
  Example #1: Email contributed by Tiffany V., Nov. 29, 2001:
  This was in the 'Washington Post'... the title of the article was 'Best Comeback Line Ever.' This is pretty damn good. Drunk and horny, he still came up with this!
  Police arrested Patrick Lawrence, a 22-year-old white male, resident of Dacula, GA, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 p.m. Friday. Lawrence will be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication at the Gwinnett County courthouse on Monday.
  The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he decided to stop. 'You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't,' he stated in a phone interview from the jail.
  Lawrence went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged 'need.' 'I guess I was just really into it, you know?' he commented with evident embarrassment.
  In the process, Lawrence apparently failed to notice the Gwinnett County police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until officer Brenda Taylor approached him. 'It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,' said officer Taylor. 'I walked up to (Lawrence) and he's...just working away at this pumpkin.'
  Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence. 'I just went up and said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?' He got real surprised, as you'd expect, and then looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn...is it midnight already?'
  Example #2: As posted on the Internet, July 30, 1998:
  Dixon, IL- Police arrested Jon Terrence McCarter, a 27 year old white male, resident of Dixon, IL, in the Sanderson Pumpkin patch at 11:38pm Friday. McCarter will be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication at the County courthouse Monday.
  The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he decided to stop. 'You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't.' he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
  McCarter went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged 'need'. 'I guess I was just really into it, you know?' he commented with evident embarrassment.
  In the process, McCarter apparently failed to notice the Dixon Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until officer Brenda Taylor approached him. 'It was an unusual situation, that's for sure.' Said officer Taylor. 'I walked up to (McCarter) and he's...just working away at this pumpkin.'
  Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached McCarter. 'I just went up and said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?' He got real surprised as you'd expect and then looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it midnight already?'
  Taylor arrested him but said that the suspect accepted his predicament in good humor. 'I have to give him credit... that was a quick comeback' Taylor said of the man's comment.
  Analysis: Even when passed off as 'news,' it's easy enough to tell that this apocryphal tale of sexual embarrassment must have had humbler beginnings as a plain old dirty joke. It's the clever punchline that gives it away, as can be more readily seen in this bare-bones version found on a humor website:
  A man is driving home late one night and is feeling very horny. As he is passing a pumpkin patch, his mind starts to wander. He thinks to himself, you know a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there is no one around here for miles. He pulls over to the side of the road, picks out a nice juicy looking pumpkin, cuts the appropriate size hole in it, and begins to screw the pumpkin.
  After a while he is really into it, and doesn't notice the police car pulling up. The cop walks over and says, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you are screwing a pumpkin?'
  The man looks at the cop in complete horror, thinks fast and says, 'A pumpkin? Is it midnight already?'
  That noted, I'm obliged to confirm that in September 2002 a disconcertingly similar incident made newspaper headlines in Warren, Michigan after a local man was convicted of traipsing around nude in his back yard and, in full view of his neighbors, 'using a pumpkin to sexually gratify himself.'  He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for indecent exposure.

"Don't Be Fooled! A Guide to Fake News Websites","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Miley-Cyrus-Kicked-Out-of-Derby-Party.htm","2017-01-02 19:53:46","  Satire is a venerable form of social commentary that uses humor to ridicule human vices and follies. The Internet is rife with it, especially news satire , or fake news, in which fictionalized accounts of current events are presented in mock-journalistic style to lampoon politicians, celebrities, and social mores .
  Satire is only effective if people recognize it as such, however, and therein lies a major pitfall of publishing fake news on the Internet. Users tend to skim texts instead of reading them, missing important clues and disclaimers. The mechanics of social sharing obscure the origin and aim of viral content, increasing the likelihood that fiction will be mistaken for, or purposely misrepresented as, fact.
  Below is a checklist of the most popular fake news sites on the web. Share as needed!
  Andy Borowitz is a genuinely funny humorist and best-selling author whose satirical news column, The Borowitz Report , debuted in 2001 and is currently hosted by NewYorker.com. Most of his columns are literally too hilarious to be believed, yet some people insist on doing so. More »
  Call The Cops bills itself as 'America's 27th most trusted source for public safety news.' Articles satirize law enforcement, firefighting, and emergency medical work. 'Stories posted here are not real and you should not assume them to have any basis in any real fact,' states the site disclaimer . 'Heck we tend to leave in spelling and grammer errors just to prove we is not the professional media.' More »
  About The Daily Currant: Q. Are your news stories real? A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world. More »
  This spin-off of the Empire Sports website (see next entry below) brings a similar warped sensibility and star-struck emphasis to general 'news' of the day. Empire News describes itself as a 'satirical and entertainment website.' Don't believe anything you read there. More »
  This site specializes in lampooning sports and sports celebrities. It originally carried no satire disclaimer per se, but the phrase ' News Satire ' was visible on the top navigation bar of every page. With headlines like 'Dog Killing Debuts As New Sport In 2014 Winter Olympics,' there's no mistaking this site's content for actual news. More »
  Free Wood Post offers social and political spoofs from a liberal point of view, mercilessly skewering right-wing politics and politicians, as well as the occasional out-of-control sports figure or self-indulgent Hollywood celebrity. From its disclaimer page : 'Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.' More »
  This site isn't really satirical, nor is it particularly funny. Fake news stories with a Global Associated News masthead are generated by ordinary folks via the prank website FakeAWish.com . Fill in a celebrity's name, and out pops a boilerplate article claiming he or she was maimed or killed in some horrific accident. Strange as it seems, these hoaxes consistently fool people. A lot of people. More »
  'About Us: Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.' (If that statement makes sense to you, there's a chance you'll actually find this fake news site funny and entertaining. Otherwise, I doubt it.) I have yet to see anything that qualifies as 'real news' anywhere on the site. More »
  This Canada-centric site also lampoons U.S. and world events, and, truth be told, just about everything else that can possibly be made fun of. 'The Lapine is all about poking people and things that deserve to be poked,' reads the site's self-description . A recent article was entitled 'Top 3 Cuss Words on Twitter.' Not biting social commentary, exactly, but often entertaining. More »
  This site credits itself with doing 'media criticism through satire,' though its articles are neither pithy nor funny. To date, MediaMass remains best known for running boilerplate stories pre-emptively dismissing celebrity death reports as hoaxes, even when those reports have been accurate. This is the very opposite of a reliable source. More »
  National Report burst on the scene in 2013 with a take-no-prisoners approach to political satire. Its content seems calculated more to push readers' buttons than to make them laugh, which may explain why it's often mistaken for real news by the very folks whose views it aims to skewer. Fortunately, as of Feb. 2014 NationalReport.net had reinstated its now-you-see-it-now-you-don't disclaimer page identifying the site as satirical. Don't be fooled! More »
  Here's another site that takes a no-holds-barred approach to making up the news. Its disclaimer page states that some of site's content is satirical, but I've found nothing on it that looks like actual news. Many of the articles, in fact, appear to based on long-debunked Internet rumors and hoaxes. Don't be tempted to take this site seriously. More »
  'Reporting what the mainstream media won't tell you,' reads the tagline of this website — and for good reason. The Racket Report's articles 'may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways,' says its About Us page . 'That means some stories on this website are fictitious.' Some stories? I have looked in vain for any non-fictitious content on the site. There is none. More »
  This site's owners aren't coy about what they're up to. 'All items on this website are fictitious,' says the disclaimer on every page. With a name like 'The Spoof,' you'd think there could be no doubt, but this is, after all, the Internet. Stories here are 100% reader-submitted and range from laugh-out-loud funny to just plain dumb. More »
  Noteworthy for such preposterous headlines as 'Dead Cow Brought Back to Life by Lightning' and 'Kentucky Man Sentenced to 235,451 Years in Jail,' this tabloid-style site emphasizes the 'faux' in faux journalism. The disclaimer page states: 'All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.' Amen. More »

  According to Miley’s manager, Miley was suffering from a serious fever, headache, and even vomiting a few times before finally cancelling the show. After, Miley was rushed to the hospital.

  A state of confusion is more like it.
  Other recent 'scoops' on the less-than-credible site include ' Justin Bieber Admits to Being Bisexual ' and ' 7-Year-Old Eli Moreno Missing After Installing Talking Angela App .'
  There is a small grain of truth behind the hoax, namely that Miley Cyrus was indeed hospitalized on April 15, 2014 after experiencing an allergic reaction to flu medication. The condition was not life-threatening, and though at least two concerts were canceled, the expectation was that the 21-year-old pop singer would finish out the rest of her 'Bangerz' tour as planned.
  A similar hoax claiming Cyrus had contracted HIV made the social media rounds in October 2013.

  Netflix Pulls Plug On Orange Is The New Black; The Reason Why May Shock You
  LOS GATOS, California
  In a bizzarre turn of events, and just months after renewing the series for a third season, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings has announced that the critcally-acclaimed series ‘Orange is the New Black’ has been cancelled.
  “We regret to inform Netflix members that Orange is the New Black has been permenantly cancelled. Starting September 1st, 2014, past episodes will not be available for streaming on Netflix.” said Hastings in a press release early Monday.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: Has Netflix really canceled its enormously popular TV series about life in a women's prison, Orange Is the New Black , after only two seasons? Can it possibly be true that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings actually said, 'A woman’s place is in the home, in the kitchen, taking care of children'? Is the word 'bizarre' (see above) really spelled with two Z's?
  The answer to all those questions is no.
  The story above was originally posted on EmpireNews.com , a spoof website on which nothing that's published is true (nor proofread, apparently). You needn't take my word for it. A disclaimer on the site reads as follows:
  Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.
  It's probably no coincidence that the day before this spoof was published it was announced that Orange Is the New Black is nominated for 12 Emmy Awards, the most nominations garnered by any scripted comedy series last year.
  Far from canceling the show, Netflix confirmed in May that it has been renewed for a third season to air in 2015. As for Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings, he has never dissed the series in public, nor, as far as I've been able to discover, expressed the sentiment that a woman's place is in the home.
  Update: Tweeted by Netflix on July 12, 2014: 'Don't worry, dandelions! @ OITNB is not cancelled. Follow season 3 production here: http://i.instagram.com/oitnb/ '

  A viral 'news article' circulating online claims President Obama has ordered the National Reserve to remove the motto 'In God We Trust' from all U.S. currency. However, there is no record of the Obama administration proposing, let alone ordering, such a measure.
  Description: Fake news / Satire Circulating since: May 2014 Status: False (details below)
  Example: Via NationalReport.net, May 24, 2014:
  Obama To Remove “In God We Trust” From All Currency Beginning July 1st
  Washington, DC — Beginning July 1st the Federal Reserve along with the United States Department of the Treasury will begin printing all currency, which includes all notes and coins, without the words ‘In God We Trust‘. This modification comes under strict orders from President Barack Obama and his administration.
  Obama held a press conference this morning to explain the impending change and to answer questions.
  Analysis: This is satire, not fact, though many readers will probably be confused by the fact that a petition exists on the official White House website urging that the words 'In God We Trust' be kept on U.S. currency and the Obama administration 'must be stopped at all costs' from accomplishing its alleged aim of removing it.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  At no time did the Obama administration propose or order the removal of the religious motto from coins or currency.
  Moreover, the petition was started by the same person who authored the fake news article, Paul Horner (who also posts under various pseudonyms, including 'Darius Rubics').
  The story originated on NationalReport.net , a satirical website with a long track record of purposely offending readers and fomenting outrage by falsely claiming that controversial measures have been undertaken by government officials. From time to time, the site has run disclaimers acknowledging that its content is fictional, but there was no such disclaimer in evidence when the above article went viral.
  (Update: As of our January 2016 update of this page, National Report had restored its disclaimer , which reads as follows: 'National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.')
  There are, in fact, atheists who argue that 'In God We Trust' should be removed from U.S. currency in the interests of maintaining the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state, and some have gone so far as to file lawsuits (unsuccessfully) demanding such a change. Barack Obama has never taken a public stand on the issue, though he once accused Congressional Republicans of having their priorities mixed up when they voted to reaffirm 'In God We Trust' as the U.S. national motto.
  Previous viral articles from National Report have included ' Obama Announces Plans for a Third Term ,' ' California Allows State-Recognized Animal-Human Marriage ,' and ' Assam Rape Festival in India Begins This Week .'

  Example: As posted on Facebook, May 28, 2013:
  Monsanto Cucumbers Cause Genital Baldness - Immediately Banned in Nova Scotia
  A six-month study by AgriSearch, an on-campus research arm of Dalhousie University, has shown that genetically modified (GM) cucumbers grown under license to Monsanto Inc. result in serious side effects including total groin hair loss and chafing in 'sensitive areas', leading to the immediate and total ban of sales of all that company's crop and subsequent dill pickles.
  The tracking study of 643 men and women in Nova Scotia came about after reports began to surface about bald field mice and the bald feral cats that ate them being discovered by farmers on acreages growing the new crop.
  Analysis: There is good reason to disbelieve any ' news story ' containing a statement like:
  There is equally good reason to disbelieve any article that appears on a website subtitled 'Canada's Best Satirical Newspaper.'
  That website is the Canadian equivalent of The Onion, The Lapine, the front page of which features headlines such as ''Choke a Canada Goose' Program Launches in Seattle,' 'Unwanted Seniors Added to Unwanted Babies Drop-Off Program,' and, in related news, 'New Monsanto Banana Promises Rapid Weight Loss and Whiter Teeth.' It only takes a modicum of critical thinking to recognize the stuff as satire.
  I'll admit that critical thinking presupposes actually reading the article, something I suspect very few of the people who have shared it via social media have done. Would it be too much to ask?

  Example: Email text contributed by Craig S., Aug. 20, 2001:
  ARKANSAS CITY (AP) -- A Little Rock woman was killed yesterday after leaping through her moving car's sun roof during an incident best described as 'a mistaken rapture' by dozens of eye witnesses. Thirteen other people were injured after a twenty-car pile up resulted from people trying to avoid hitting the woman who was apparently convinced that the rapture was occurring when she saw twelve people floating up into the air, and then passed a man on the side of the road who she claimed was Jesus.
  'She started screaming 'He's back, He's back' and climbed right out of the sunroof and jumped off the roof of the car,' said Everet Williams, husband of 28-year-old Georgann Williams who was pronounced dead at the scene. 'I was slowing down but she wouldn't wait till I stopped,' Williams said. She thought the rapture was happening and was convinced that Jesus was gonna lift her up into the sky,' he went on to say.
  'This is the strangest thing I've seen since I've been on the force,'said Paul Madison, first officer on the scene. Madison questioned the man who looked like Jesus and discovered that he was dressed up as Jesus and was on his way to a toga costume party when the tarp covering the bed of his pickup truck came loose and released twelve blowup dolls filled with helium which floated up into the air.
  Ernie Jenkins, 32, of Fort Smith, who's been told by several of his friends that he looks like Jesus, pulled over and lifted his arms into the air in frustration, and said 'Come back here,' just as the Williams' car passed him.
  Mrs. Williams was sure that it was Jesus lifting people up into the sky as they passed by him, according to her husband, who says his wife loved Jesus more than anything else.
  When asked for comments about the twelve dolls, Jenkins replied 'This is all just too weird for me. I never expected anything like this to happen.'
  
  Willis says he went out of his way to attribute the story to the nonexistent 'EAP' news service so as not to deceive anyone, but as you can see in the above variant, at least one anonymous emailer has changed it to read 'AP' (Associated Press) to lend it an air of authenticity. Judging from the quizzical mail I've received so far, some people truly aren't sure whether to believe it or not.
  For future reference, most theologians are rather firmly convinced that if and when Jesus does return, he's not likely to be driving a pickup truck.

  The internet was abuzz this past week when a mug shot of accused arms dealer Jeremy Meeks hit the web, making women swoon and men jealous over his movie-star good looks.
  Apparently all the attention Meeks has gotten since being arrested has only helped him, as billionaire actress and media mogul Oprah Winfrey has reportedly agreed to pay Meeks’ $900,000 bail, with the intent of giving him a job as a talk show host on her OWN Network.

  Analysis: While it's true that a 'sexy' mugshot of convicted felon Jeremy Meeks went viral after it was posted on Facebook by the Stockton Police Department on June 18, 2014, it is not true that Oprah Winfrey offered to post his bail and give him a job as a talk show host.

  Full text: As posted on Facebook, March 27, 2012:
  Americans for a More American America
  Analysis: Only the first sentence of the above quotation, widely attributed to Republican presidential primary candidate Rick Santorum , was actually uttered by him. The rest is fictitious and amounts to a caricature of his views.
  For example, though he does, as a conservative Catholic, generally oppose pornography and 'homosexual acts' (which he distinguishes from a 'homosexual orientation') — both of which he says harm the institutions of marriage and the family — Santorum has never claimed that gay pornography is 'the reason people choose the gay lifestyle,' nor that if gay pornography were banned 'homosexuality would be gone within a matter of months.' Nor has he ever claimed to 'see eye-to-eye with the Taliban' on anything.
  He has, however, indicated support for state anti-sodomy laws prohibiting homosexual behavior. And though Santorum has not, in so many words, vowed to 'ban' all pornography, he has effectively promised to do so if elected President, stating that he would appoint an Attorney General who will 'vigorously enforce' existing federal obscenity laws prohibiting the distribution of hardcore pornography.
  Actual Rick Santorum statements on pornography:
  'America is suffering a pandemic of harm from pornography. A wealth of research is now available demonstrating that pornography causes profound brain changes in both children and adults, resulting in widespread negative consequences. Addiction to pornography is now common for adults and even for some children. The average age of first exposure to hard-core, Internet pornography is now 11. Pornography is toxic to marriages and relationships. It contributes to misogyny and violence against women. It is a contributing factor to prostitution and sex trafficking.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  'Every family must now be concerned about the harm from pornography. As a parent, I am concerned about the widespread distribution of illegal obscene pornography and its profound effects on our culture.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  'The Obama Administration has turned a blind eye to those who wish to preserve our culture from the scourge of pornography and has refused to enforce obscenity laws. While the Obama Department of Justice seems to favor pornographers over children and families, that will change under a Santorum Administration.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  Actual Rick Santorum statements on homosexuality:
  'I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts. As I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. I have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who's homosexual. If that's their orientation, then I accept that. And I have no problem with someone who has other orientations. The question is, do you act upon those orientations? So it's not the person, it's the person's actions. And you have to separate the person from their actions.' [ Source: Associated Press interview ]
  'We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.' [ Source: Associated Press interview ]

  According to witness reports Coulter was concerned the experienced, decorated pilot in question may have gained her position as a result of affirmative action and wasn't fully qualified to fly.

  Allow me to also direct your attention to the name of the alleged TSA spokesperson quoted in the article: ' Dirk Diggler .' (Did anyone here see Boogie Nights ?)

  The following text, author unknown, appeared on a fake CNN web page (since deleted) on April 1, 2008. This is NOT a real news story!
  Rapper Snoop Dogg converts to Mormonism
  By Aaron Nichols CNN
  DIAMOND BAR, California (AP) -- In what some may consider an unexpected move, rap artist 'Snoop Dogg' has reportedly converted to Mormonism after nearly a year of study with the fast-growing, Utah-based faith.
  {PHOTO CAPTION: Snoop Dogg says he 'can't get enough of the Book of Mormon.'}
  In a statement, a spokeswoman for Snoop Dogg -- whose real name is Calvin Broadus -- said he considers himself extremely fortunate to have discovered such a deep sense of spiritual fulfillment at this stage in his life.
  “Mr. Broadus is also very pleased to find that his family is as enthusiastic about attending church services as he is,” the spokeswoman said.
  However, Snoop Dogg has not been enthusiastic about publicly sharing his experience and declined to be interviewed by CNN for this article.

  In fact, he reportedly informed producers of his E! reality show 'Snoop Dogg's Father Hood' that this particular aspect of his family's life was off-limits to the cameras. Still, he left open the possibility of addressing the subject in future episodes.
  According to the Associated Press, Snoop Dogg was first introduced to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is officially known, after attending a Gladys Knight concert in an LDS meeting house in Los Angeles.
  Knight, who very publicly discusses her conversion to Mormonism several years ago, invited Snoop Dogg to what is known to the Mormon faithful as “Family Home Evening,” a church program that encourages families to set aside Monday evenings for gospel-centered lessons and family togetherness.
  Though Snoop Dogg has been hesitant to publicly discuss his recent spiritual journey, he commented on the experience of attending his first “Family Home Evening” in a recent interview with People Magazine.
  “I was hooked from the start,” Snoop Dogg said. “We talked about the purpose of life, played Mousetrap, and ate brownies. The kids thought it was off the hook, for real.”
  In what Snoop Dogg now thinks was anything but a coincidence, Mormon missionaries had knocked on his door just one week before the Knight concert. He said he had initially turned them away because of what he knew about the strict Mormon health code, which prohibits members from smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs.
  “Y’all know me,” he said grinning broadly. “There were just certain things the old me -- the 'natural man' -- needed to do. And these young guys are telling me that God’s not down with disrespecting ourselves. But it’s cool now.”
  Snoop Dogg said his conversion marks the end of his old life, one that included frequent run-ins with the law. Snoop Dogg was convicted in 1990 of cocaine possession and charged with gun possession after a 1993 traffic stop. In 1997, he pleaded guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence.
  In 1996, Snoop Dogg was acquitted of murder after a purported gangbanger was killed by gunfire from the vehicle in which Snoop Dogg was traveling.
  Snoop Dogg dismisses critics who claim his conversion is intended to placate a Salt Lake County judge, before whom he is appealing an alleged probation violation.
  “Listen, the haters will say what they will,” Snoop Dogg said. “I can only do what I feel is right.” ---------------------------------------

  Analysis: False. Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor did not make the statements attributed to her above. Some of the remarks attributed to President Obama and White House press secretary Robert Gibbs were made by them, though not, of course, in this fictitious context. In short, the 'news story' quoted above is pure satire, originally posted June 2, 2009 on the Carbolic Smoke Ball website, self-described as 'Proud publishers of fake news since 2005.' The point of the spoof was to lampoon a controversial remark Sotomayor actually did make in 2001, namely the suggestion that judges' life experiences and ethnic backgrounds play a role in their decision making. 'I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,' she said in a speech delivered at the UC Berkeley School of Law. When confronted in a recent TV interview with the substance of Sotomayor's 2001 remark, which some have criticized as 'racist,' President Obama responded as follows:
