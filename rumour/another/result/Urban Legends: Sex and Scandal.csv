  In which we explore the claim that chewing this (or any other) 'curiously strong' brand of mint before performing fellatio (oral sex) enhances the pleasure of the receiving party.
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: November 1997 (email version) Status: Matter of opinion (details below)
  Example: Email text as circulated in 1997:
  Subject: Altoids in a whole new light
  This is an absolutely true story - forward it around to friends who might get a kick out of it.
  Had the most interesting conversation with the top sales weasel at our company today. She came into my office and noticed I had a box of Altoids on my desk.
  (Have you had them? They are these obnoxiously strong peppermints made in England.) As soon as she saw them, she burst into laughter. Turns out she had recently had an affair with a guy who called her and left her an incredibly steamy voice mail message after an encounter. He went on and on about what a blow job goddess she was, how amazing she was, how he'd never be the same, etc. She was kind of puzzled, thinking: what did I do to this guy that was so different from my regular technique?
  She finally figured it out: she's a smoker, and before getting intimate with him, she had gone to the bathroom to 'freshen up.' Not having a toothbrush, she crunched on about four Altoids and then got busy. Apparently things went amazingly.
  So she passed this little tidbit on to another female sales weasel, who immediately tried it out on *her* fiance. Apparently this guy has never, ever been into oral sex, but liked the mint sensation so much that he asked her to stop and chew another Altoid mid-blow job. He is now a fellatio gourmand.
  This news has been going around our office. Having a box of Altoids on your desk is now like being part of the Secret Blowjob Goddess Society. It's the equivalent of having the hottest car or coolest computer. News spread like crazy among the females, who all went out at lunch to Walgreens to buy a box of Altoids (about $2 for 100 or so), and their partners across the city tonight are getting one hell of a corporate blow job. As far as company-wide morale boosting events, it doesn't get much better.
  Some of the men found out, too -- they went out after work to buy them for their wives. They strategized on how to get their wives to eat them.
  And people wonder why I work in technology.
  (For what it's worth -- it really does work! It leaves a lasting tingle that is apparently quite exquisite.)

  Analysis: I wish I had scientific data to either back this up or refute it, but unfortunately there's a shortage of, er, hard evidence.
  Anecdotal reports are easier to come by, albeit inconclusive. Some people who admit trying Altoids-enhanced fellatio insist the mints make a marked difference; others say 'Ho-hum.'
  As written and circulated on the internet, the story is pure folklore, of course. Word-of-mouth rumors about the special benefits of chewing various brands of super-strong mints (including Mentos, Tic-Tacs, Fisherman's Friend, and others, in addition to Altoids) just before engaging in oral sex preceded the anonymous email tale by many years.
  For an example of just how pervasive the urban legend has become, have a look at this excerpt from Cosmopolitan magazine's 'Sex Lessons' column from a few years back on the ins and outs of fellatio:
  Altoids also figured in the Clinton/Lewinsky White House sex scandal during the 1990s and is forever enshrined in the pages of the Kenneth Starr report. The record shows that one evening in the Oval Office, intern Monica Lewinsky handed a print-out of the very same email posted above to President Bill Clinton, coyly informing him she happened to be chewing one at the time. For reasons we shall probably never know, Clinton rebuffed her. He did not have Altoids-enhanced sexual relations with that woman — at least not on the night of Nov. 13, 1997.

  September 14, 1998
  From the Office of the Independent Counsel last week came 445 pages of a peculiarly American form of entertainment: the details of William J. Clinton's sex life. Early reviews made Kenneth Starr's long-awaited tome seem promising.
  'Dirt and filth,' raved Rep. Charles Rangel (Democrat, New York), 'a nickel-and-dime lurid sex story.'
  'There is a pornographic value to this,' enthused Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
  'Resembles a steamy paperback,' declared the Washington Post .
  Unfortunately, the Starr report fails to live up to its notices, offering precious little of what the American people really want from these proceedings, namely hot sex tips from the highest office in the land. One wades through endless volumes of kiss-and-tell testimony to learn little more than that the President's lovemaking philosophy can be summed up in the words, ''Tis better to receive than to give.'
  Starr-crossed lovers
  Most disappointing of all, a portion of the report devoted to White House intern Monica Lewinsky's account of the affair reveals that our Starr-crossed lovers came to the very brink of authenticating a notorious urban legend touting the benefits of a certain 'curiously strong' breath mint during oral sex, then dropped the ball.

  We can't blame Lewinsky, whose testimony proves she was ever ready to take the bit between her teeth. On this occasion it was Clinton who blew it.
  From the Starr report on events allegedly occurring Nov. 13, 1997:
  Fickle priorities
  We cannot but wonder at the President's fickle sense of priorities. No time for oral sex? Further testimony shows that on many other occasions Mr. Clinton was prepared to drop his pants at a moment's notice.
  Nor could he have failed to recognize the import of the experiment Lewinsky was proposing, as detailed in the print-out she handed him.
  Whether it's an impeachable offense I don't know, but Clinton's refusal to put this folk belief to the test when he had a clear and present opportunity to do so compounds the evidence that he does not always have the best interests of the American people at heart. Once again, he has failed to provide the leadership this country needs and wants — a sad commentary on the current state of the presidency, and of the nation.

"The Blind and Prophetic: Tiresias","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/tiresias.htm","2015-10-30 03:13:02","  Those Greek gods and goddesses were always copulating, or thinking about copulation, or planning to copulate. And all throughout the myths the smorgasbord approach seems to dominate: now a taste of the husband, now a taste of the wife, a generous helping of lover or married neighbor, and even a small side-dish of that generally forbidden fruit — one's own grown children.
  One afternoon (and we can imagine it to be a crystal clear Spring day, all fibers and sinews fairly crackling with sexual tension) the father of the gods, Zeus , and his queen, Hera , were having another of those foreplay-type discussions. At one point, striking a pose, Zeus made the playful observation to his spouse: 'I insist, you women have more joy in making love than men do.' The goddess demurred, and denied it. Hmm ... how to resolve this? They'd ask Tiresias , who had actually experienced both sides of lovemaking.
  As Ovid tells us: 'One day, while in the green wood, Tiresias offended with a stroke of his stick two immense serpents, mating, and (O wonder!) was changed from man to woman.

  Thus he lived for seven years.'
  In the eighth year he again encountered the two serpents, engaged in having the same pleasure, and after thinking about it he struck again and was again transformed — back into a man.
  So, when Zeus and Hera approached him with their vivid question he knew the answer, and avowed that Zeus was correct. Piqued, the dear goddess struck him blind! In compensation, however, the flummoxed god bestowed on him the gift of prophecy.
  As Saul Bellow once put it, 'Truth comes in blows.' So take heed: in a moment of mythic truth, the unlikely may very well happen!
  Backstory
  In ancient Greek mythology, Tiresias was the son of a shepherd named Everes and a nymph named Chariclo. Tiresias, who always spoke his mind, seems to have had a special knack for insulting Hera, queen of the gods, who punished him for his alleged transgressions by physically altering his body.
  It was Hera who changed him into a woman after the unfortunate incident with the copulating snakes, and Hera who blinded him after he took Zeus's side on the question of which gender has more joy during lovemaking (although there is another version of the myth in which he is blinded by Athena after he saw her naked in a bath — this is often the way it is with myths).
  Tiresias was also said to have lived to be very, very old — seven or nine generations depending on who was telling the tale. He did eventually die, however. In Homer's Odyssey , Odysseus was sent to him for a prophetic reading in the underworld.
  Tiresias was also a character in Sophocles' Antigone .

"Celebrity Stomach Pump","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/celebrities/a/stomach_pump.htm","2016-08-23 06:31:27","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  Have you ever heard the legend about Rod Stewart passing out on stage?  He was subsequently taken to the hospital and had his stomach pumped.  From within his stomach, they allegedly siphoned many ounces of fresh semen, enough to fill a pint glass.  A mug of cum!
  Dear Reader:
  And so discreetly phrased! Thank you!
  You may be interested to know that precisely the same story, give or take a pint or two, has been told of Elton John, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Jon Bon Jovi, Alanis Morissette , Britney Spears and Lil' Kim, to name but a few. Rod Stewart just happened to be the main target of the rumor when it was going around in the 1980s. Apparently it was assumed by many people that he's gay, which is contrary such evidence as we have regarding the matter.
  The origin of the story dates back to the early '70s, when seemingly every high school and college campus across the United States could claim a ' Promiscuous Cheerleader ' who, rumor had it, was rushed to the the emergency room to have her stomach pumped after servicing the entire football team (or basketball team, etc.) at a party.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Clearly the moral focus of this cautionary tale has changed over time, with female rock stars replacing gay-seeming male rock stars as the 'slutty cheerleaders' of the moment.
  As to the fundamental credibility of the story, well — never mind the practicalities of how a person might manage to ingest so much semen in one sitting when the average volume of male ejaculate, according to experts, is one-half to one teaspoon and there are 96 teaspoons in a pint (do the math) — what I'd like to know is, can semen really be so toxic that emergency stomach pumping is required?
  Given that it consists only of water, sugar, proteins, and some harmless trace ingredients, I suspect not.
  2012 Update Kudos to Rod Stewart, who took it upon himself to address the stomach pump allegations in his book, Rod: The Autobiography , published Oct. 23, 2012:
  Interestingly, Stewart describes the rumor as an act of revenge by an employee he had fired, his personal assistant Tony Toon.
  'Toon's revenge was absolutely inspired,' Stewart wrote. 'He fed the press a story in which, as a consequence of an evening spent orally servicing a gang of sailors in a gay bar in San Diego, I had been required to check into a hospital emergency room to have my stomach pumped.'
  Though he acknowledges that the rumor has dogged him ever after, Stewart reflects upon the experience with surprising grace and forgiveness. 'Say what you like about Tony Toon — and God rest his soul,' he wrote, 'but he was good at his job.'
  It's a cautionary tale after all.

"The Bridegroom's Revenge","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/grooms_revenge.htm","2015-11-23 07:28:12","  By David Emery
  Example #1: As told by a reader:
  A bride and a groom are at their wedding reception. Everything is going perfectly when the groom stands up to give a toast. He thanks all the guests for coming and for the stack of presents on the table, then thanks the father of the bride for the beautiful reception.
  He then tells the guests that he has a surprise for all of them. He instructs them to look under their chairs. They do and find a picture taped to the bottom of each seat.
  The guests are shocked and horrified! It's a picture of the bride and the best man having sex! The groom says he had a feeling they were having an affair and hired an investigator who took the photo. He then says to the father of the bride, 'Thanks for the $30,000 sit-down dinner and party, but I'm out of here.' And he walked out.
  He filed for an annulment the following Monday.
  Example #2: As told by a reader:
  I heard this from someone who said their brother was at the wedding...

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Apparently, a man and a woman had a huge wedding. When they were at the reception and it was time for the best man's speech, the groom stood up instead. He said he knew it was highly irregular that he was speaking, but he had something to say. He wanted everyone to know that the wedding was totally legal and on the up and up. The man with him, he continued, was his divorce lawyer. If the wedding guests would all flip over their plates, they would see the reason. With that, he tossed off his champagne and walked out.
  On the bottom of every plate was a picture of the bride and best man walking into a cheap motel room together. The electronic date on the photo was three days before the wedding.
  Example #3: As told by a reader:
  I heard this story about a man and woman who got engaged. They were both from very wealthy families. Eventually the wedding day arrived. It was a huge wedding with hundreds of guests, many of whom had flown or driven great distances to be there. The ceremony went off smoothly and all the guests headed for the lavish reception.
  When it was time for the groom to give his speech he thanked all the guests for their wonderful gifts and for taking the trouble to travel so far to share the happy occasion. He said he was so grateful to all the guests that he had arranged a gift for each person at the reception. All they had to do was reach under their chairs and each would find an envelope stuck to the bottom with the gift in it.
  Naturally, all the guests quickly reached under their chairs and retrieved the envelopes. Each one contained an 8x10 color glossy photo of the bride and the best man having sex and obviously going for it with a will.
  There were gasps of horror and fainting women. Amidst all the bedlam the groom got the final words in by cursing the bride and the best man, stating that he had known of the affair for some time and that his lawyer would be applying for an annulment on the following day.
  Analysis: Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand has traced this story (also known, in a gender-reversed version, as ' The Bothered Bride ') back to a brief item in a 1985 newspaper gossip column that subsequently ran as a full-blown 'news story' in the Weekly World News , a U.S. tabloid. It has also circulated widely since the mid-1990s via forwarded email and social media. While such an incident certainly could have happened, no one has ever come forward with evidence that it did.

  Netlore Archive: A self-described 'spectacularly beautiful' woman posts an online personals ad stating her wish to pair off with a marriageable 'rich guy' in New York City.  Wall Street banker replies, 'Your offer... is plain and simple a crappy business deal.'
  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: September 2007 Status: Unknown (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Gregory D., October 11, 2007:
  THIS APPEARED ON CRAIG'S LIST
  What am I doing wrong?
  Okay, I'm tired of beating around the bush. I'm a beautiful (spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. I'm articulate and classy. I'm not from New York. I'm looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I don't think I'm overreaching at all.
  Are there any guys who make 500K or more on this board? Any wives? Could you send me some tips? I dated a business man who makes average around 100 - 150. But that's where I seem to hit a roadblock. 150,000 won't get me to central park west. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married to an investment banker and lives in Tribeca, and she's not as pretty as I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right? How do I get to her level?
  Here are my questions specifically:
  -Where do you single rich men hang out? Give me specifics - bars, restaurants, gyms
  -What are you looking for in a mate? Be honest guys, you won't hurt my feelings
  -Is there an age range I should be targeting (I'm 25)?
  -Why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the upper east side so plain? I've seen really 'plain jane' boring types who have nothing to offer married to incredibly wealthy guys. I've seen drop dead gorgeous girls in singles bars in the east village. What's the story there?
  -Jobs I should look out for? Everyone knows - lawyer, investment banker, doctor. How much do those guys really make? And where do they hang out? Where do the hedge fund guys hang out?
  -How you decide marriage vs. just a girlfriend? I am looking for MARRIAGE ONLY
  Please hold your insults - I'm putting myself out there in an honest way. Most beautiful women are superficial; at least I'm being up front about it. I wouldn't be searching for these kind of guys if I wasn't able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a nice home and hearth.
  --------------------
  THE ANSWER
  Dear Pers-:
  I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament. Firstly, I'm not wasting your time, I qualify as a guy who fits your bill; that is I make more than $500K per year. That said here's how I see it.
  Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a crappy business deal. Here's why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring my money. Fine, simple. But here's the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity...in fact, it is very likely that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won't be getting any more beautiful!
  So, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and I am an earning asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation accelerates! Let me explain, you're 25 now and will likely stay pretty hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in earnest. By 35 stick a fork in you!
  So in Wall Street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy and hold...hence the rub...marriage. It doesn't make good business sense to 'buy you' (which is what you're asking) so I'd rather lease. In case you think I'm being cruel, I would say the following. If my money were to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades I need an out. It's as simple as that. So a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage.
  Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, I wonder why a girl as 'articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful' as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500K hasn't found you, if not only for a tryout.
  By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then we wouldn't need to have this difficult conversation.
  With all that said, I must say you're going about it the right way.
  I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of lease, let me know. ____________ Rob Campbell J.P.Morgan Diversified Industrials Investment Banking 277 Park Avenue, 16/F, New York , NY 10172

  Analysis: Craigslist is a classified ad website which also attracts its fair share of pranksters, so the authenticity of the above exchange — which began on September 25, 2007 with the post entitled 'What am I doing wrong?' — has been questioned by some people right along.
  'It does look as if the post was made sincerely,' a Craigslist spokesperson told the New York Times two weeks after it first appeared. But reporters' queries to the anonymous poster's mailbox have gone unanswered, and — to no one's surprise, really — she(?) has not stepped forward to claim authorship.
  The Wall Street banker's response bears the signature line of Rob Campbell, an actual employee of J.P. Morgan Chase & Company's investment banking division, but the company denies he authored it, stating that Campbell merely forwarded the message as received, whereupon his email program automatically appended his signature line. This is perfectly plausible given that the same thing happens to 'frequent forwarders' all the time. What's more, the exchange was already making the rounds before Rob Campbell's name became attached to it.
  A well-known Craigslist prankster has also denied authoring the reply.
  Hoax or not, the complementary postings function well together as a humorous commentary on the current state of the 'Battle of the Sexes,' which, as folklorists Dundes and Pagter noted in their 1991 collection Never Try to Teach a Pig to Sing: Still More Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire , remains fraught with tensions 'as old as humankind itself.'

""Earth Didn't Move" for Astronauts, NASA Says","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/astronauts_sex.htm","2015-10-19 03:00:22","  By David Emery
  Pierre Kohler's allegations that NASA space shuttle astronauts conducted 'sex experiments' in outer space aren 't just false, they're based on a well-known Internet hoax.
  According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a French science writer's claim that American astronauts conducted sex experiments while orbiting the earth in the space shuttle in 1996 are completely false.
  Pierre Kohler, author of The Final Mission : Mir, the Human Adventure , alleges the experiments were minutely described in a top secret NASA publication identified only as 'No. 12-571-3570.' The publication also goes into great detail, he says, as to proposed solutions to problems encountered by astronauts who attempted to have sex under weightless conditions. Among those are tethering the participants together with giant elastic bands and having them perform the act inside an inflatable tunnel.
  This text was supposedly discovered — where else? — on the Internet.

  NASA responds that no such document exists, or has ever existed, adding that the supposed title doesn't even correspond to the actual numbering system used by the agency to identify its publications.
  'It’s one of those urban myth things,' NASA spokesman John Ira Petty told MSNBC News.
  Another NASA spokesman labeled the Internet text 'fraudulent.'
  Yet another stated, 'We are not, have not and do not plan to conduct any sex experiments.'
  To be fair, Kohler's book focuses primarily on experiments he claims were conducted by cosmonauts in the USSR space program, but he unambiguously asserts that the United States pursued similar research. The experiments were videotaped, Kohler maintains, and the tapes subjected to rigorous analysis. 'One of the principal findings was that the classic so-called missionary position, which is so easy on earth when gravity pushes one downwards, is simply not possible,' he said in an interview. Not without modifications, anyway.
  Unfortunately for Kohler, who has built his case around the information contained in the mysterious, above-mentioned NASA document, there's no evidence that it exists apart from references to it in another Internet text, ' NASA Publication No. 14-307-1792 .'
  Besides the fact that the 'NASA Publication No. 14-307-1792' is an obvious put-on spoofing the kind of scientific and bureaucratic jargon that tends to go into such studies, there's the teensy-weensy problem that this very document, in its entirety, has turned up in online postings dating back to 1995.
  According to Kohler, the zero-G sex experiments the document supposedly describes weren't conducted until 1996.
  Oops!
  Update: According to Wikipedia , the date of the original online posting of the satirical text 'NASA Publication No. 14-307-1792' has been established as Nov. 28, 1989.

  Homemade web page masquerading as an AP news story published on CNN.com claims that women can decrease their risk of breast cancer by, quote, 'performing the act of fellatio on a regular basis.' Uh-huh. Some less-than-careful mainstream media outlets (they know who they are) bought this hoax hook, line, and sinker. Did you?
  Description: Web hoax / Joke Circulating since: Oct. 2003 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: As posted in an Internet forum, Oct. 9, 2003:
  Study: Fellatio may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer in women
  Thursday, October 2, 2003
  (AP) -- Women who perform the act of fellatio on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.
  Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.
  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.
  'I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act,' said Dr. B.J. Sooner of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. 'I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women.'
  The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.
  'Only with regular performance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine,' said Dr. Inserta Shafteer, one of the researchers at the University. 'Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances.'
  The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.
  In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.
  Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or 'play down' these findings.
  'This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases,' Lictepeen said.
  Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.
  'There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages,' he said.
  Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers.
  The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not. The group of women who had performed fellatio had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.
  'The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio,' Shafteer said. 'It's a cause, not THE cause.'

  Analysis: Is it really necessary to debunk this story? The names alone suffice to show it's a spoof: Dr. B.J. Sooner . Dr. Inserta Shafteer . Dr. Len Lictepeen .
  This was not published by the Associated Press. Or CNN.com.
  In point of fact, this faux report first appeared on a college student's website in October 2003. It vanished without explanation soon afterward, only to reappear 24 hours later with a disclaimer stating that the story — which now bore a byline: 'Brandon Williamson' — was intended for 'entertainment purposes only.' (A revised version was stripped of all graphics and references to CNN, presumably due to threats of litigation.)
  Those who find this sort of prank amusing will probably also enjoy ' Ogling Breasts Increases Men's Lifespans ,' a similar spoof circulating since 2000.

  'In retrospect, lighting the match was my big mistake. But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil,' Eric Tomaszewski told bemused doctors in the Severe Burns Unit of Salt Lake City Hospital. Tomaszewski, and his homosexual partner Andrew 'Kiki' Farnum, had been admitted for emergency treatment after a felching session had gone seriously wrong.
  'I pushed a cardboard tube up his rectum and slipped Raggot, our gerbil, in,' he explained. 'As usual, Kiki shouted out 'Armageddon', my cue that he'd had enough. I tried to retrieve Raggot but he wouldn't come out again,so I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.'
  At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next. 'The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and a flame shot out the tubing, igniting Mr Tomaszewski's hair and severely burning his face. It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers which in turn ignited a larger pocket of gas further up the intestine, propelling the rodent out like a cannonball.'
  Tomaszewski suffered second degree burns and a broken nose from the impact of the gerbil, while Farnum suffered first and second degree burns to his anus and lower intestinal tract.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: Albeit attributed to the Los Angeles Times , this lurid bit of potty humor did not originate in any newspaper. Neither the content nor the style conforms to even the lowest of journalistic standards. It's fake news, a joke, or more precisely a joke bordering on an urban legend , because people insist on claiming it's true. Variants of the story can be found in Internet message board postings dating back to 1993.
  I'm obliged to point out that the term 'felching' is, um, sorely misused in the text. It's an actual slang word that refers to a sexual activity, and that sexual activity has something to do with rectums, but nothing to do with gerbils. Rather than attempt to provide a clinically correct definition of the term, I will refer you to the Internet . The Internet knows more about felching than you likely will want to know yourself. Fair warning.
  The narrative does revolve around an instance of what some like to call 'gerbilling' (or 'gerbil stuffing'), which, simply defined, is — supposedly — the act of inserting a live rodent into one's own or another person's anus for sexual pleasure.
  I say 'supposedly' because despite the fact that a name for such a practice exists, there's no evidence that the practice itself does. Quite the opposite, in fact. 'Both in my professional and personal life, thousands of guys have freely admitted to doing the most out-there, dangerous, risky, stupid, kinky stuff,' sex advice columnist Dan Savage wrote in 1998 . 'But not once in all these years has anyone ever told me that he, or anyone he knows, or anyone anyone he knows knows, has ever put a gerbil in his ass. Like the doomed gerbils themselves, this story has no legs. It is an urban legend.'
  The best known gerbilling story in popular culture is, of course, the Richard Gere story , in which it's said that the actor was supposedly rushed to an L.A. emergency ward many years ago to have a stuck gerbil removed from his rectum. Virtually everyone in America, I'm tempted to say, knows somebody who knows somebody who claims to have been right there when Gere was admitted to the hospital, or knows the surgeon who performed the gerbilectomy, or a nurse who was sworn to secrecy.
  Although Gere has never out-and-out denied the story — and really, who would ever want to actually say the words, 'No I didn't put a gerbil in my butt' — he did once mention it in a magazine interview in which he said, 'I stopped reading the press a long time ago. Lots of crazy things came up about me at first, especially from the tabloids. There is an infamous 'Gere stuck a hamster up his bum' urban myth.'
  The man doesn't know a hamster from a gerbil. What are the odds he had an intimate encounter with either one?

"Survival of the Silliest","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/darwinawards/a/survival_of_the_silliest.htm","2016-05-31 04:53:28","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  What truth is there behind these ' Darwin Award ' winners? I never seem to read anywhere else about these awards for human stupidity except via email. In particular, the 1998 round has an especially troublesome story (see below). Seems to me that there are a lot of clues to its possible fictitious origins. Either way, I'd love to know if you have heard anything about this or other 'Darwin Award' winner stories.
  Truth may be stranger than fiction, but some things are just too strange:
  FLAGSTAFF, AZ: A pre-med student from the University of Arizona was looking to score big with his date on a Friday night. Determined to put the girl in the mood, he drove her up to a spot on Mount Lemmon which overlooked the city of Tucson. They walked to an open knoll where they could see the city lights.
  Overcome by the romantic locale, she succumbed to his pleas and they stripped down, made a bed of their clothes, and passionately began making love. The heavy storm clouds rolling overhead and the low rumble of thunder inside them excited the lovers even more. At the first few flashes of lightning, they never looked up to see the charred remains of once great trees.
  Their idyllic clearing was a hotbed of electrical activity during the warm desert nights. With a blinding light, a bolt of lightning struck the high point on the knoll, which happened to be the pre-med student's ass, and sought the path of least resistance --- straight down! Incredibly, he survived, but was in excruciating pain. The heat of the lightning had fused together flesh and latex so that the lovers were now stuck together like a pair of dogs. The girl, unfortunately, did NOT survive the lightning strike!
  When the student looked down into the vacant eyes of his girlfriend and realized she was dead, his immediate repulsion caused him to jerk away from her, which of course, he couldn't! A wave of pain and nausea made him vomit into the girl's face and open mouth! Heaving only caused more pain and repeated vomiting until he finally passed out.
  Attracted by the smell of 'food,' a bear found its way to the Siamese lovers and began to lick semi-digested pizza and buffalo wings from the dead girl's face. The student came to, but when he saw the bear, there was little he could do but lay there silently in fear. To his horror, the bear became dissatisfied with just a lick and started to eat the girl, loudly crunching her facial bones only inches from his ear. The bear also tasted the student, scraping the back of his skull with its teeth, before moving on.
  Around mid-morning a group of junior girl scouts, up for a fun weekend camp-out, arrived at the campsite where the pre-med student's car was parked. It was only a matter of minutes before three screaming girls discovered the student, who had regained consciousness several times in the night and had managed to drag himself and the partially-eaten girl about 20-feet.
  Doctors managed to 'successfully' separate the student from the corpse, but Mr. Happy looked like a small piece of cauliflower in its flaccid state. The first hint of arousal resulted in so much pain, that the student was unable-- -and unwilling- --to achieve an erection. Future surgeries may produce a reasonably functioning penis, but the student's family jewels, referred to by the doctors as the 'scrotum mass,' are irreparable.
  Although most Darwin Awards are supposed to be won posthumously, we think this guy deserves consideration since he successfully removed himself from the gene pool .

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Dear Reader:
  From a storytelling point of view, I must say that if the discoverers of these lightning-fused lovers hadn't turned out to be a troop of girl scouts, the tale would have sucked me in long enough to bother researching it. But this and other details are just too clever, too perfect, too good to be true. I give it a thumbs-up for humor and a thumbs-down for credibility.
  For those who don't know what the Darwin Awards are, they're yearly prizes given out posthumously ( by definition ) to 'individuals who have given their all in an effort to improve our gene pool ... who have made the ultimate sacrifice of killing themselves by the most extraordinarily stupid means.'
  The joy of the Darwin Awards (and their only real point) lies in the hilarity of the nominated stories. It hardly matters who wins the actual prize. In fact, the yearly announcement is always somewhat anticlimactic.
  As to their general credibility, it's a mixed bag. The Awards first surfaced years ago as a sort of spontaneous creation of the internet and were highly unreliable then, with no single body, self-appointed or otherwise, to authenticate the stories or officially crown the winners. Eventually, two 'official' Darwin Awards sites appeared on the web, one at darwinawards.com and the other (now defunct) at officialdarwinawards.com.
  As you might surmise, there ensued domain name bickering and skirmishes over ownership of material between the two, but one service both sites have tried earnestly to provide is the sorting out of the false stories from the true. The surviving site still does a reasonably good job of it.
  Even so, the internet being what it is, it remains the case that anyone can make up a story, declare it a Darwin Awards nominee (or even a winner) and circulate it to their heart's content, regardless of whether it meets the agreed-upon criteria or any standards of authenticity.
  Such is the case with the present example, which achieved the honor of being posted on darwinawards.com in 1998 — but as an ' urban legend ,' not a Darwin Award winner.

"The World's First Male Pregnancy","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/male_pregnancy.htm","2016-05-30 16:52:51","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  I was pointed to the website www.malepregnancy.com and there is quite a story there. Evidently they are claiming this Mr. Lee is actually pregnant. There are biomedical facts and statistics, live video and photos as well as an interview.
  Is this legit?
  Dear Reader:
  Legit? I think not. We don't even know who the father is.
  The more relevant question is: Is it art? Because that's the spirit in which this elaborate Internet hoax was conceived.
  ' POP! The First Human Male Pregnancy ' purports to follow the medical progress of a Taiwanese man who volunteered to have an embryo implanted in his abdominal cavity. According to the website, the child will be delivered by Caesarean section when it reaches full term (the whole gruesome process is detailed here ).
  If authentic, this would obviously be a true medical first — notwithstanding every 'man gives birth' story we've seen on the covers of supermarket tabloids this past century (e.g., ' Man Gives Birth to a Healthy Baby Boy ' in the July 7, 1992 issue of the Weekly World News ).
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  But it's not true. On the contrary, it's an elaborate put-on conceived by artists Virgil Wong and Lee Mingwei . Both are members of a collective known as 'PaperVeins,' described as 'a multidisciplinary arts group developing work about the human body as seen through medicine, society and technology.'
  GenoChoice , the nonexistent research firm credited with providing the technical know-how to get Mr. Lee knocked up, was also masterminded by Wong (who, online records show, owns both the malepregnancy.com and genochoice.com domain names). 'This is a fictitious web site,' states a disclaimer on the GenoChoice home page, 'created to be an exploration of a very likely scenario that may one day result from new advances in biotechnology and infertility treatments.'
  Moreover, Lee Mingwei's bio attests that he ' ostensibly became the first man to gestate and carry a child in his own body' [emphasis added]. A closer look at the site reveals that the 'streaming videos' and 'live EKG of Mr. Lee,' as well as the 'ultrasound video' of the fetus, are simply animated GIF images. They remain precisely the same from one day to the next.
  So the whole thing is fake. But is it plausible?
  Not very. Some scientists have argued that a male pregnancy is theoretically possible, but in reality the procedure would be so dangerous that the risks would outweigh any possible benefits.
  Essentially what it would require would be inducing an ectopic pregnancy — wherein an embryo is implanted somewhere other than the uterus — in a male subject. In women such pregnancies are considered so hazardous (the number one cause of first-trimester deaths) that they're almost always terminated soon after diagnosis. Even if such a condition could be artificially induced in a male, the subject would run a greater and greater risk of hemorrhaging to death as the pregnancy proceeded.
  So the whole thing is implausible. But is it art?
  Well, sure — if only in the sense that it's an elaborately constructed farce credited to two established conceptual artists. But there's nothing particularly original or groundbreaking here. In a deadpan interview, Lee Mingwei waxes indignant over the fact that historically the idea of a man bearing a child has been considered laughable. It's been the butt of jokes in folklore and popular culture from ancient times because it flies in the face of gender stereotypes in virtually every society, not to mention nature.
  'Now that pregnant men are a reality,' Lee says, tongue planted firmly in cheek, 'no one is laughing anymore!'
  Ah, but they are. Because, in fact, it's the same old joke dressed up as 'art' and represented on a fancy website. Folks are still laughing at the idea of a pregnant man, trust me.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  I read somewhere that in a 1975 Sears catalog, there is a penis visible in one of the pictures. Is this true? It sounds kind of urban legend-y to me, but I'm curious to know.
  Dear Reader:
  One man's 'penis' is another man's 'innocent blotch,' if you know what I mean.
  I'm old enough to remember chuckling furtively over the photo in 1975 when friends were passing the infamous Sears catalog around. Opinion seemed to be divided about half-and-half  some of us were utterly convinced that what we were looking at was the real deal, so to speak, while others scoffed. Cecil Adams has compared it to a Rorschach Test  i.e., the phallus is in the eye of the beholder.
  Real or not, the 'peeking penis' caused quite a stir at the time. Sears eventually tried to explain the phenomenon away as a printing blemish, but by then it had already been immortalized by country singer Jack Barlow (a.k.a. 'Zoot Fenster') in a popular novelty song called 'The Man on Page 602.'

  Netlore Archive: During a lavish wedding ceremony at Clemson University with 300 attendees, the groom suddenly interrupts the proceedings to reveal a shocking secret about the bride and the best man, with photographic evidence to boot.
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: 1995 (online versions) Status: False (see details below)
  'MasterCard Wedding' example #1: Email contributed by Dan M., July 14, 2001:
  For anyone who feels they've been invited to too many weddings lately have a laugh. This is actually true. It was in a local newspaper in South Carolina and even Jay Leno mentioned it on the Tonight Show .
  This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.
  After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.
  To thank everyone for coming, bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.
  He said that this was his gift and told everyone to open their envelopes.
  Inside each envelope was an 8x10 photo of his best man having sex... with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding.
  After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, 'F*CK you!' He turned to his bride and said, 'F*CK you!' Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, 'I'm out of here!'
  He had the marriage annulled the first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway, as if nothing was wrong.
  His revenge:
  1) Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guests for a wedding and reception.
  2) Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And, best of all...
  3) Trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends and their entire families.
  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might see one of those MasterCard 'Priceless' commercials out of this? Huh?

  Subject: Revenge
  This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding.
  He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.

  This guy has balls the size of church bells. This is his world, we just live in it.
  Analysis: This apocryphal tale has undergone some interesting revisions since it first erupted in the summer of 1985. There are two basic versions: one has the bride interrupting the wedding ceremony to reveal that the groom slept with the maid of honor; the other has the groom interrupting to announce that the bride slept with the best man.
  In The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton: 1986), Jan Harold Brunvand reports receiving a flurry of word-of-mouth variants beginning in August 1985, as well as one print version entitled 'The Bothered Bride' by a columnist for the Pioneer Press and Dispatch of St. Paul, Minnesota, and another, 'Bride's Wedding Shocker,' from the tabloid newspaper Weekly World News in December of that same year.
  The story continued to circulate on into the '90s, meriting a write-up by Chicago Tribune reporter Cheryl Lavin (correctly pegging the tale as an urban legend) in November 1990 and turning up on Internet message boards in early 1995 as a ' true story ' that happened at Clemson University. The main difference between the Internet version and previous tellings is the groom's alleged use of photographs of the bride and best man caught in flagrante delicto to inform the wedding guests of their indiscretion. An extended version dating from 2001 features the 'Priceless' tag line from the well-known series of MasterCard TV commercials and continues to circulate to this day. The story is now popularly known as 'MasterCard Wedding.'
  Also known as: 'Clemson Wedding' or 'Wedding Revenge.'

"Is Mountain Dew a Contraceptive?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/mountain_dew.htm","2016-05-18 14:07:20","  A shocking bit of misinformation has captured the hearts and minds of high school and college students of late — the notion that the popular caffeinated soft drink Mountain Dew can be used as a contraceptive.
  If Internet chatter is any indication, it is widely believed among people in this age group that drinking Mountain Dew 'kills sperm cells' or, at minimum, drastically lowers a male's sperm count.
  There are some who fear it may cause impotency, while others seem to view it as a cheap and easy method of birth control.
  Lest you think I'm joking, in 1999 the Wall Street Journal reported that in the fall of that year this factoid 'boomeranged across the country from Oregon to Washington, D.C., and from Texas to Montana.' Its currency continues to perplex health care officials, not to mention PepsiCo, the manufacturer of the allegedly spermicidal soft drink.
  'This is an urban myth ,' says Jonathon Harris, a public affairs manager in the company. He likens it people believing Elvis is still alive and claiming to have bumped into him in a convenience store — i.e., not merely false, but, in Harris's words, 'absurd, unfounded and ridiculous.'
  True believers attribute the soft drink's purported sperm-killing properties to its relatively high caffeine content (55 mg. per 12 oz. can, versus 45.6 mg. in Coke and 37.2 mg. in Pepsi) and/or the presence of a coloring agent named Yellow Dye No. 5, but there's nothing in the scientific literature to support either claim. The FDA determined long ago that Yellow Dye No. 5 poses no physiological threat to non-allergic people, and, as for caffeine, there's evidence to suggest it actually increases the motility and efficacy of sperm cells, not the opposite.
  These misconceptions date back to the mid-1990s, if not further. Variations on the theme have included such claims as Mountain Dew 'causes your testicles to shrink' or 'shrivels your penis.' Where these ideas came from is unclear, but they echo stories going even further back in time (a decade or more) to the effect that certain companies allegedly owned by the Ku Klux Klan or other racist organizations purposely add sterility-inducing ingredients to foods and beverages popular with African Americans.
  The Dew rumor's current growth spurt may be partially due to a surge in the popularity of the product itself. According to figures compiled by Beverage Digest , as of this writing Mountain Dew is the fastest-growing soft drink in the U.S.
  As I mentioned earlier, the spread of these tall tales among young people has some health care officials worried. The state of Wisconsin, to name one governmental authority, has warned parents that the notion that Mountain Dew functions as a spermicide could spark a rise in the number of unwanted pregnancies.
  Marjorie Saltzman, a longtime Planned Parenthood volunteer in Portland, Oregon, has lobbied PepsiCo to address the misinformation through advertising or special warning labels — so far without success, she says. For its part, the company claims it has never received a consumer inquiry or complaint in connection with the rumor.
  To its credit, PepsiCo has responded forthrightly to questions from the press, but Pepsi's PR folks would do well to resist the temptation to adopt a dismissive attitude toward the urban legend. Granted, it's a 'schoolyard tale' with no foundation in fact — comparable to Elvis sightings and the like — but bumping into a dead pop star at the neighborhood 7-11 has never, to my knowledge, resulted in an unwanted pregnancy.
  Just because an idea is silly, that doesn't mean it's harmless.

  'Medical study' supposedly published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims staring at women's breasts every day is good for men's health.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: Don't get your hopes up, guys. No such study was ever published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( check for yourself ).
  A search of the thousands of peer-reviewed articles contained in the National Institutes of Health medical journal database turns up zero items documenting the health benefits of staring at women's breasts, and, for that matter, zero items authored by 'Dr. Karen Weatherby' (who does not exist, so far as I can tell).
  If the story smacks of supermarket tabloid faux-journalism, well, that's precisely what it is. The text first hit the Internet in March or April 2000, mere weeks after a strikingly similar article appeared in the consistently misinformative Weekly World News (nor is this the first time we've encountered baseless Internet rumors traceable to precisely that source). A slightly different version had already appeared in the May 13, 1997 issue of the tabloid.
  A fresh round of breast-staring mania overtook the Internet in March 2011, when Fox News republished the story before checking the facts.
  It showed up again a few months later on the Scottish news site Daily Record & Sunday Mail : ' Doctors Say Looking at Busty Women for 10 Minutes a Day is Good for Your Health .'
  It goes without saying (I hope) that it's unwise to take medical advice from tabloid 'news' stories, still less from forwarded emails. Males who wish to increase their lifespans ought to consider practicing common sense as an alternative — it's more likely to achieve the desired result than any amount of public breast ogling.
  Admittedly, I don't have any medical research to back that up. Volunteers?

  Analysis: This image has been circulating for several years and crops up frequently on sites like Pinterest and Reddit. The earliest post I've found is a Sept. 29, 2011 entry on Boing Boing describing the pictured advertisement as 'a relic of olde-world naiveté.'
  The ad copy reads as follows:
  'Outside of you, Mickey — that milk is the best thing in the world!' enthuses a grinning Minnie Mouse while pointing to a giant bottle of Grand Rapids Creamery milk.
  'INSIDE of you, Minnie,' Mickey Mouse responds, 'my milk is the best thing in the world!'
  It's not wholly implausible that such a risqué ad, whether intentionally suggestive or not, could have been published in some more naive era — say, the 1930s — nor that the innuendo that makes it so funny to us now could have gone right over the heads of its intended audience. We've seen examples of this before .
  Moreover, a milk company called Grand Rapids Creamery really did exist, and published a monthly promotional comic book during the mid-1930s using Disney characters to advertise its products. An ad almost identical to the one pictured above appeared in the June 1934 issue of Grand Rapids Creamery's Mickey Mouse Magazine , but here's the thing. In the original ad copy Mickey Mouse didn't say, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, my milk is the best thing in the world!' What he actually said, more accurately mirroring Minnie's words, was, 'INSIDE of you, Minnie, that milk is the best thing in the world!'
  In short, the text in the viral version has been altered to yield a verbal double entendre that didn't exist in the original. Don't feel bad if you were fooled by it. So was BuzzFeed writer Brian Galindo , not to mention E! Online correspondent John Boone , who wrote: 'Maybe it's just an innocent little double entendre that the ad agency thought was clever and — wink wink — a little bit naughty, do you get it?' The Photoshop job was so convincing that it was included in a Nov. 21, 2012 Cracked.com feature, ' 6 Retro Ads With Accidental Sexual Innuendos .'
  Turns out it was an example of new world, not 'olde world,' naiveté.
  The Walt Disney Company, Disneyland and Disney cartoon characters have been the subjects of many urban legends and online hoaxes over the years. One recent hoax falsely claimed that Harry Potter actress Emma Watson is set to star in a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid . Another used doctored images to demonstrate an ' amazing likeness ' between photos of Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding to Disney's 1950 animated classic, Cinderella . And then, of course, there's the classic urban legend claiming that when Walt Disney died in 1966 his body was cryogenically frozen and preserved for future revival at a secret location in Disneyland. Not true. His body was cremated, in accordance with his wishes.

  'I'm as baffled as you are,' Landers admitted in her reply to 'Baffled Mom,' but that didn't stop her from offering this profoundly liberal-minded advice: 'As long as you trust the mother of these girls to supervise for the duration of the party, I see no harm in it.'
  Well, all this sounded not merely suspicious but suspiciously familiar to Newhouse News Service reporter Dru Sefton, who dove into the archives to see what she could find out about this supposed 'trend.' Just as she suspected, it proved to be a persistent and false urban legend — 'serial prank' might actually be more accurate — one that has caught advice columnists Abigail Van Buren, Ebony Adviser, T.

  Berry Brazelton and now Ann Landers with their proverbial pants down one-by-one since it first surfaced in the mid-1990s.
  'Relax, parents,' Sefton concludes in her article, ' Urban Legend Is Disrobed, but Not Before Another Advice Columnist Bites .' According to various experts Sefton consulted, including a child psychiatrist and the author of a book on pajama parties, nude sleepovers are not 'all the rage' among teen-age girls these days, nor — except perhaps in the erotic fantasies of teen-age boys — have they ever been. Indeed, a Google search on the keyword phrase 'naked slumber party' yields mostly porn results.
  For the record, the current 'Abigail Van Buren,' Jeanne Phillips — who co-wrote the column for several years before taking it over completely from her mother, Pauline Phillips, in 2002 — saw through the hoax and didn't bite. 'I dismissed it as a young boy's prepubescent fantasy,' she told Sefton.
  But her mother had actually published a very similar letter in 1996. 'Dear Abby,' it began. 'My daughter, who is 15, went to  slumber party last weekend. She told me that it was a normal all-girls slumber party — they talked, ate, played games, watched videos and finally slept — except they spent the entire evening totally nude. There were no men in the house, just the eight girls and the host girl's mother, who approved of it. My daughter was so thrilled about it and the girls are talking about the next one. ... I can't come up with a compelling reason to say no.'
  Phillips responded: 'Tell her that you were not raised in an atmosphere that condoned casual nudity and you are uncomfortable with the idea of her attending nude slumber parties. Period.'
  It's interesting that at least four different advice columnists received similarly worded letters on this bogus topic over a period of seven years. Was it the work of one very determined prankster, or a series of copycat hoaxes? It's unlikely we'll ever know the answer to that question.

"The Necrophiliac's Gift","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/necrophiliac.htm","2015-05-28 15:57:31","  By David Emery
  I returned from a brief vacation to find a message in my inbox from Tor Strand, a reporter for the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang .
  'In our country,' he began, 'there is a story going wild among people these days...'
  Oh, boy, here it comes, I thought. He's going to tell me that Scandinavian gangbangers are firing on innocent drivers who flash their headlights at oncoming vehicles. It's happening everywhere else , you know.
  Instead, Mr. Strand surprised and delighted me by recounting the following tale, which he assumed to be an urban legend :

  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  How romantic!
  Strand informed me that precisely the same thing is alleged to have happened in at least a half-dozen Norwegian towns — a strong indication that his assumption is correct: it's an urban legend.
  Diagnosis: myiasis of the vagina
  That said, it's worth noting that the phenomena described aren't completely beyond the bounds of medical possibility. Maggot infestations of living human tissues do occur. The scientific term for it is ' myiasis .' There have even been recorded cases of myiasis of the female sexual organs, though these are extremely rare.
  One case in particular caught my attention as I scanned the medical literature. In the abstract of a study entitled ' Vulvar Myiasis ,' published last year in Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology , researchers summarized 'the case of a 19-year-old pregnant girl diagnosed with vulvar myiasis and concomitant syphilis, vaginal trichomoniasis and genital candidiasis.' Oh, and she also tested positive for HIV.
  The diagnosis of a maggot infestation of the vulva combined with with four common venereal diseases suggests that the myiasis may have been sexually transmitted, too –- another nod toward the plausibility of Tor Strand's Norwegian horror story. One would think the odds against the survival of fly eggs on or in the gentleman's penis between the time of his necrophilic adventure and his encounter with the female protagonist of the story would be quite high, but apparently it's not out of the question.
  'The Bad Date'
  Still, when we find precisely the same story popping up in different places and marked by subtle differences in the telling, it's fair to conclude we're dealing with some type of folklore , even when it's conceivable there's a factual basis for it. Tor Strand made reference to six or seven variants. I can cite yet another: ' The Bad Date ,' shared by Øystein Skundberg in an online discussion in 1998:
  Boy breaks up with girl, who in her despair picks up a man at a bar, comes home with him, and has casual, unprotected sex. After some days, she experiences bad itch in her crotch. The girl goes to a medical doctor, which upon examining her looks very serious and concerned, says nothing, but gives her an appointment with a specialist. Girl off to specialist. He/she examines the girl, turns very grave, makes some notes, and tells her that she will have the results of the test in a week.
  The bewildered girl goes home. The next week, the police turns up on her doorstep to question her. When she ask why, they explain that the police is routinely contacted by doctors in every case of corpse-worm.
  The Skundberg variant employs a classic storytelling device: the three visits. In this example, proper diagnosis of the patient's condition is twice postponed, even though the condition should be perfectly obvious to the first doctor she sees. This is for dramatic effect. Doctor #1 examines her and appears 'concerned,' but refers her to a specialist. The specialist evinces a similar 'grave' reaction, but tells the patient she'll have to wait two weeks for test results. Our poor protagonist remains in the dark about her affliction until she's visited a week later by a policeman, who nonchalantly informs her that doctors routinely report all cases of 'corpse worm' to the authorities. Gasp!
  Maggots and metaphors
  Even if it stretches credulity, a well-honed horror story is bound to be a hit, and this one has clearly caught on in Norway. Its popularity may also stem from the fact that it can serve as a poignant and frightful metaphor for the dangers of indulging in unprotected sex in the age of HIV and AIDS. Maggots, which feed on carrion, have long been a literary symbol for death. In the present narrative, casual intercourse with a stranger leads to a carrion-like condition of the genitals — a symbolic brush with death through the act of sex. The imagery is powerful and disturbing, the moral perfectly suited to the times.
  I doubt we've heard the last of this one.

"Are John Dillinger's Private Parts on Display at the Smithsonian?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/john_dillinger.htm","2015-08-21 14:32:13","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  You are no doubt tired of hearing this, so I will be brief and not waste much of your time. I believe I read an article by Robert Anton Wilson a ways back regarding the Smithsonian or some D.C. museum housing private parts of famous people — John Dillinger, for example. Is there any truth to this folklore?
  Dear Reader:
  No truth that I could uncover. Moreover, the very idea that so august and respectable an edifice as the Smithsonian Institution would house an exhibit of celebrity genitalia rings absurd. They've denied it time and time again.
  'In response to your recent inquiry,' begins a statement from the management of the Smithsonian quoted in Dillinger: The Untold Story (Indiana University Press, 2005), 'we can assure you that anatomical specimens of John Dillinger are not, and have never been, in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution.'
  A spokesperson queried by the New York Times in 1994 put it even more bluntly: 'We have no penises.'

  There seems little room for doubt.
  What about Walter Reed Army Medical Center?
  There's another well-known museum in Washington, D.C., the National Museum of Health & Medicine at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, whose exhibits do boast both celebrity body parts and diseased/abnormal sexual organs. But though it is home to such fascinating oddments as President Eisenhower's gall bladder and John Wilkes Booth's vertebrae, you won't find private parts of famous people anywhere on the premises, I'm told. Specifically, according to the Museum's online FAQ , you won't find the private parts of Prohibition-era gangster John Dillinger:
  The mystery of the posthumous pelvic bulge
  Despite decades of denials, the Smithsonian Institution alone receives over a hundred requests per year for viewings of the purportedly pickled penis, says a report in Maxim magazine.
  There must be a reason for all this prurient interest, and as it turns out one needn't search far to find it. For several years running one of the most popular entries on the now-defunct World Sexual Records website was this question: 'Is it true that John Dillinger had a 20-inch penis?' It's a line of inquiry that goes back at least half a century, I discovered, suggesting that the size of Dillinger's organ has long been an urban legend unto itself.
  It all started, apparently, with the photograph mentioned above showing Dillinger's draped cadaver shortly after he was gunned down by FBI agents in 1934. In it, there appears to be an abnormally large, er, protrusion in the pelvic region — so large a protrusion, in fact (the height of which has been estimated at anywhere from 13 to 28 inches), that one of the pathologists in attendance felt compelled to remove the anomalous appendage and preserve it for posterity.
  Or so the story goes.
  Skeptics have objected all along
  Skeptics have objected all along that the disproportionate protuberance — which isn't even visible in other photographs of the cadaver — could be explained by factors as mundane as a raised knee under the sheet or the placement of the cadaver's arm, etc. It's even conceivable that the entire tableau was staged as someone's idea of a joke. For what it's worth, the official autopsy report makes no mention of a detached or missing penis — in fact, it makes no mention of Dillinger's private parts at all.
  None of which is to say that someone with privileged access to the corpse couldn't have made off with the precious organ between the autopsy and burial and preserved it in formaldehyde; stranger things have happened. There's no shortage of people who claim to have seen it. For that matter, a con artist could have passed off the pickled privates of an imposter as Dillinger's at some point in time, unintentionally giving rise to this very urban legend .
  It isn't too far a stretch to imagine John Dillinger's Penis as a lucrative sideshow attraction back in the day . . . right next to the jar containing Adolf Hitler's Brain.

"About That Thing with Richard Gere and the Gerbil ...","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/richard_gere.htm","2016-01-23 16:23:36","  I don't mean to sound cranky, but it's more than a bit wearisome that the first thing that pops out of some people's mouths when they learn I write about urban legends is, 'What about that thing with Richard Gere and the gerbil ? Is that true?'
  You learn a lot about human nature in this racket. Or should I say, a lot of your worst suspicions about human nature are confirmed, time and time again.
  Like, people everywhere are suckers for gossip about sex.
  Weird sex. The-weirder-the-better sex. We're obsessed with it, in fact, and that seems to short-circuit our capacity for rational thought.
  How many here already know what ' gerbilling ' is? Raise your hands.
  Now, how many of you actually believe that anyone really does this sort of thing on a regular basis?
  Raise your hands.
  I see. Shame on you.
  For those of you still sitting in the dark, here's a definition: gerbilling (sometimes referred to as gerbil stuffing ) is the practice, most often attributed to gay men, of inserting a live rodent into one's rectum (or that of a partner) for erotic pleasure.
  And what are the known facts about gerbilling? In reality, it's not a 'practice' of any group of people, gay or otherwise. And while the activity, dangerous as it may be (gerbils have claws!), has surely been tried by someone, somewhere, sometime — maybe even more than once — it is not, if I may repeat myself, a common erotic pastime in any known culture or subculture, gay, straight, or otherwise.
  The burden of proof is on those who claim otherwise .
  The specific rumor we're here to address goes something like this:
  Several years ago, 'they' say, Richard Gere was admitted into the emergency room of a Los Angeles hospital with a foreign object lodged in his rectum. Some say Gere was alone when he arrived, others say he was accompanied by a friend (former love interest Cindy Crawford tops the list).
  In any case, an x-ray was taken and it was determined that the foreign object was a gerbil (either alive or dead at that point, depending on who tells the story). Mr. Gere was rushed to surgery, where it literally took a team of doctors to extract the unfortunate animal. Some say the gerbil was found to have been shaven and declawed; others claim it had been encased in a special plastic pouch. I've even heard it said that the gerbil was Gere's own beloved pet (appropriately named 'Tibet' in this variant). In any event, when the gerbilectomy was done the medical team was sworn to secrecy (unsuccessfully, we must conclude), and Gere went on his merry way, suffering no permanent harm other than to his reputation.
  'Is it true?' you ask.
  There isn't a shred of evidence that it ever happened. And while Gere himself has neither confirmed nor denied it — indeed, he has rarely spoken of it at all — neither have credible witnesses come forward in the twenty-some-odd years this story has been circulating to offer firsthand testimony to back it up.
  'I've never worked harder on a story in my life,' National Inquirer reporter Mike Walker told the Palm Beach Post after spending months trying to verify the rumor in 1995.
  He came away convinced he'd been chasing an urban legend.
  Richard Gere wasn't the only, nor even the first, American celebrity to be defamed with such allegations. Identical rumors circulated during the 1980s about a Philadelphia TV news anchorman , and later about a certain linebacker for the Cleveland Browns.
  How, why, and where did the story come to be attached to Richard Gere? No one knows, exactly. Some commentators point out that shortly after Gere achieved national attention for his appearance in the film Pretty Woman , an anonymous hoaxer forged a fax alert purporting to originate from the ASPCA deriding the actor for what it labeled 'gerbil abuse.' The accusation bounced from one end of Hollywood to the other, and beyond. But whether this was the legend's actual point of origin remains uncertain.
  Why would someone invent such a story? For the same reasons any vicious rumor about a celebrity gets started. Movie stars are wealthy, powerful people, always in the public eye and always, therefore, the subject of envy.
  They're walking targets for defamation. There exist in this world people who seek to bolster their own self esteem by sullying other people's reputations — by trying, in essence, to steal a bit of that celebrity's fame and glory for themselves. So it has been since time immemorial.
  The story bears every hallmark of an urban legend .
  While the basic narrative has remained consistent through the years, smaller details have varied and mutated, exactly as one would expect in a story told and retold tens of thousands times over.
  Like every classic urban legend, the tale of Richard Gere and the gerbil conveys a moral message, perhaps best articulated, if half-facetiously, by Cecil 'The Straight Dope' Adams: 'Stick to mammals your own size.'
  Lastly and most poignantly, the presumption that the story is valid always rests on the alleged personal experience of witnesses other than the storyteller, someone who was 'there when it happened' but who is always at least two or three acquaintances removed from the person speaking or writing.
  Here's a verbatim example from (where else?) the Internet:
  And another:
  Everyone I've questioned who reported having heard the story offers some variation of the the above: 'I know someone who knows someone who was working in that hospital when it happened.'
  Based on how frequently that claim has been made, I calculate there must have been no fewer than a hundred thousand people on staff at 'that hospital' ( Cedars Sinai ) that night. Surely you know one of them, too.
  Update: In 2006, actor Sylvester Stallone publicly stated that he believes Richard Gere blames him personally for starting the rumor. Or was Stallone slyly trying to take credit for it? You be the judge.

  Synopsis: Man arrives at hospital with scrotum swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit. The doctors examining him find he has one testicle missing and a gaping wound that appears to be held together by staples. Then he tells them his story...
  Description: Viral story Circulating since: 1991 Status: True
  Example:
  When a 40-year old man arrived at a hospital asking to see a doctor specializing in 'men's troubles', he was shown to a cubicle. There, he gingerly unwrapped three yards of foul smelling, stained gauze from around his scrotum, which had swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit.
  On further inspection, it was discovered that his left testicle was missing completely and, embedded within the swollen, tender and weeping wound, were a number of dark objects which the patient confessed were one inch staple nails from an industrial staple gun.
  It transpired that the man spent lunchtimes alone in the workshop, where he regularly enjoyed the sexual thrill of placing his penis on the moving canvas fan belt of a piece of machinery. One day, the excitement had caused him to lose his concentration and the fan-belt had snatched his scrotum into the fly-wheel, throwing him several feet across the floor and removing his left testicle. Rather than go to hospital, he self-administered first aid using a staple gun and then continued work when his colleagues returned. It was two weeks before he got around to visiting the hospital.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: It's tempting to dismiss this grisly story as a prurient joke, but we have it on good authority — that of attending physician Dr. William A. Morton, Jr., who penned a now-famous journal article on the case in 1991 — that the incident really happened. David Herzog, a reporter for the Allentown Morning Call , confirmed the details of the case with Morton in 1992. Morton's article, a dubious claim to fame if there ever was one, originally appeared in the journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality .
  The text of that article has circulated via fax, forwarded email and social media ever since, spawning a great many shorter, less accurate versions of the story (such as the one above) in the process. It's irresistable, let's face it.
  Thanks to the Internet, 'Scrotum Self-Repair' has enjoyed such a wide distribution that folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand saw fit to include it in his 1999 omnibus of urban legends Too Good to Be True , citing word-of-mouth variations (e.g., 'the scrotum is said to have swollen to the size of a basketball') that have spun off from Dr. Morton's original published text. Interestingly, many of those spoken-word variants had been conveyed by doctors and medical students who had themselves heard them on the job. For such a science-based calling, the medical profession is a hotbed of urban legendry.
  Probably the main reason the story captures people's imaginations so is that it revolves around what is essentially an act of masturbation — and no ordinary act of masturbation, at that. So, it's a cautionary tale , of sorts, though I doubt very many people need to be instructed or reminded not to perform sexual acts on themselves (or on anyone else) in close proximity to power tools.
  Among the most frequently asked questions about urban legends is whether they ever turn out to be true. Well, here you go. I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a better affirmative example than this.
  Users (and abusers) of power tools beware!

  She thought nothing of him again until she and her daughter pulled into their driveway. She saw his briefcase and realized she had forgotten him! She opened it looking for some form of identification so she could notify him about his belongings. Inside she found nothing but a knife and a roll of duct tape!

  Example #2 As told by a reader:
  A young woman was leaving a local shopping mall, only to find that she had a flat tire. A well-dressed young man carrying a briefcase came up to her and asked if she needed help. She told him she would call AAA, but when she did she was told it would be over an hour before a truck would be dispatched to her site. The gentleman urged her to let him fix her flat and she finally allowed him to do so.
  When he was finished, he asked if she would give him a ride to the other side of the mall, as his car was parked there. Looking at her watch, she realized how late it was and apologized to the young man saying that she needed to get home as it was her daughter's birthday and her husband was at home with the two children awaiting her arrival. The man went on his way.
  When she got home, she told her husband what had happened at the mall and about the man who came to her aid. The husband went out to look at the tire and saw that the man had inadvertently left his briefcase in the trunk of the vehicle. He brought it into the living room and they opened it to see if they could find the man's name and phone number.
  Upon opening the briefcase, they found only five items: a rag, chloroform, duct tape, a body bag and an ice pick (which was probably used to cause the flat tire ).
  Analysis: A newer version of this urban legend dating from 1998 was set in the parking lot of an actual, specific shopping center in Columbus, Ohio, the Tuttle Crossing Mall. According to local police and mall officials, however, no such incident ever took place there.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand refers to the story as 'one of the most common and most fully analyzed of all contemporary legends,' which is partly a function of its age. A variant known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag' (or ' The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker ') dates back to the horse-and-buggy era. In that version, a driver consents to give a ride to an elderly woman who turns out, upon closer examination, to have extremely hairy arms — she's a man in disguise! Justifiably panicked, the driver invents a ruse to get the 'woman' out of his vehicle and speeds off to safety, only to discover a handbag left behind in the passenger seat containing just one item: a hatchet.
  Every variant of this cautionary tale shares the 'close call' motif — the driver, always a lone female, nearly falls into the clutches of a would-be assailant but escapes just in time . In some versions she senses a tell-tale sign of danger — the old woman's man-like arms, for example, or, in the Tuttle Mall variant, the good samaritan's creepy insistence on being driven across the parking lot after he fixes the driver's flat tire. In other versions, including as the ones retold above, the driver escapes due to pure happenstance — she suddenly recalls a pressing appointment and speeds off before the assailant can climb into the car. Either way, the close call is an obligatory narrative turn, else who would be left to (supposedly) tell the tale?

"The Uses and Abuses of Superglue","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/business/a/superglue.htm","2014-07-19 15:14:49","  I found this posted online, original source unknown:
  Fact or fiction?  It's hard to say for sure, but the fact that the selfsame item has been posted and reposted on the Internet as 'fresh news' for 15 years running casts a smidgen of doubt on its authenticity.
  Befitting its status as a modern miracle invention, superglue looms large in urban legendry. In its purest form the stuff can withstand a ton of pressure on a one-square-inch bond. It sets in seconds and can be used to stick anything to just about anything else, permanently. Since its discovery 60-odd years ago, the ultra-sticky substance known to consumers as Super Glue, Krazy Glue, Permabond and Kola Loka has inspired a plethora of folktales which generally fall into one of three categories: Origins, Mishaps and Pranks.
  Superglue origins
  The following was culled from a message board posting:
  Not quite. Although superglue has been used with great success in place of sutures for certain medical procedures, the oft-made claim that it was originally invented for this purpose is false.
  In fact, superglue (known to chemists as cyanoacrylate ) was invented quite by accident. Twice. In both cases, scientists were hoping to come up with new plastic compounds for use in applications such as gun sights and jet canopies but happened unexpectedly upon a formulation that stuck to basically everything it touched.
  The first time it happened, during World War II, researchers found it a nuisance. The second time, during the 1950s, a light bulb went on in somebody's head. The product was first sold commercially in 1958.
  Superglue mishaps
  Found on the web, attributed to the Indianapolis Star , February 7, 1994:
  True! A survey of the medical literature on superglue indicates this kind of mishap is far more common than one might assume. Apparently, people mistake the stuff for other, similarly-packaged products such as eye or ear drops all the time, and end up in the emergency room. In one study, researchers compiled a list of 14 different cases all of which occurred in a single year. This type of mishap, dubbed 'inadvertent self-administration of superglue' by physicians, has inspired consumer groups to call for repackaging of the adhesive.
  Hobbyists and home repair enthusiasts have been known to share tales of accidental adhesions, the consequences of which are usually benign and easily remedied. 'Have you had a little superglue mishap? Get your fingers stuck together?' asks one practical advice columnist. 'Use an old wash cloth and nail polish remover to clean that melted mess in no time!'  For what it's worth, I'm told that only nail polish removers containing acetone will work, but this is still handy advice in sticky situations.
  Superglue pranks
  From The Sun , a London tabloid, in 1996:
  Disbelieve if you will, but according to the BBC a strangely similar incident happened more recently in the United States, where, the story goes, 'a gambler sued a casino for 30,500 pounds after claiming he got stuck to a glue-smeared toilet seat and had to waddle through the casino for help.' (Drat those American toilets — no panic button!)
  'Superglue Revenge'
  And then there are the stories of, um, interpersonal bonding — the suspected criminal who superglued himself to his girlfriend to prevent police from arresting him; the woman who affixed herself to her foreign-born husband to stop authorities from deporting him; and the red-faced woman who showed up in the emergency room with both hands stuck to her boyfriend's private parts.
  Add a motive like revenge to such scenarios and you are smack in the middle of urban legends territory (in case you had any doubt up to this point).
  The best known of all cyanoacrylatic abuse tales is 'Superglue Revenge,' in which an angry wife/girlfriend allegedly waits until her philandering or abusive husband/boyfriend falls asleep then glues his penis to another body part (most often his thigh) — a cautionary tale to be heeded if there ever was one.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported several 'Superglue Revenge' variants in his 1984 collection of urban legends, The Choking Doberman . A Hollywood version popular in the early 1990s claimed that actress Sean Young did it to then-boyfriend James Woods during an exceptionally tempestuous break-up. Ms. Young, who believes the story was maliciously promulgated by Woods himself, dismissed it as a lie in a 1993 Playboy interview.
  In one of those disconcerting examples of life imitating legend, a 16-year-old girl in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was charged with assault in July 2000 for gluing her cheating boyfriend's penis to his abdomen. The girl claimed she meant it as a joke, but the boyfriend wound up in the hospital and juvenile authorities were not amused.
  Do not try this at home!

  Bob: Yes, Olga?
  Olga: Uh...
  Henry: Go ahead.
  Bob: Yes, Olga.
  Olga: I'm trying to think. Um... Gee, Henry, what did you say?
  Bob: Hey, don't ask him. He can't help you out at all.
  Olga: Is it in the ass? [Last three words bleeped]
  Bob: No, no, no... No... What I'm talking about is the weirdest location, the weirdest place...
  Olga: The weirdest location. I don't know.
  The video clip received its widest viewing in 2002 when it was aired on an NBC special called The Most Outrageous Game Show Moments . After that, Eubanks was no longer in denial. This is what he wrote in his memoir entitled It's in the Book, Bob! in 2004:
  One particular episode on the show that was alleged to have occurred -- or did occur -- has spawned nothing short of an urban legend. It even inspired the title of this book. I am, of course, referring to the famous (or infamous) 'In The Butt' incident. Did it happen? And if so, exactly what happened? I sincerely told people for many years that it never happened. Then someone showed me a clip and proved me wrong. It did happen, but not precisely the way mythology and collective memory have it happening.
  Eubanks' emphasis on the point that it didn't happen precisely the way people had said it did wasn't mere quibbling. Though based on a real incident, the story had taken on a life of its own and didn't entirely line up with the facts. Variation is one of the defining characteristics of an urban legend . It wasn't just the dialogue that varied — one of the most commonly shared versions of the story before the video clip came to light portrayed the newlywed couple as African American, and the famous line, 'That'd be the butt, Bob,' was quite often attributed to the husband, not the wife.
  To demonstrate just how far afield a true story can go once it's divorced from its origin, here's a variant I received years ago from a reader in England:
  A newlywed couple in England were at their reception, where the DJ was playing Mr & Mrs. If you're not in the know, Mr and Mrs was a British TV game where one partner was asked questions about the other whilst they were out of earshot, and then the question was repeated to see if their answers matched. The DJ was asking the groom all sorts of questions such as 'Which side of the bed does she sleep?' and 'What's her most disgusting habit?' when he came to the final question: 'Where's the strangest place you've ever had sex?' The groom started by laughingly replying that he had no intention of answering, until eventually, egged on by the baying audience, he replied: 'In the back of my car.' A huge roar of approval went up as the bride was led back into the room, to give her replies to the questions. The DJ went through all the questions again until finally he got to the last: 'Where's the strangest place you've ever had sex?'
  The bride started shaking her head and muttering 'No way' as the crowd began to bay for a reply. Even the grannies and the old aunts were getting involved, pleading for the answer. Eventually the groom came over and gently took her by the arm saying 'It's okay, honey, I told them.' 'You're sure?' she asked, nervously. 'Of course, darling, I'm sure,' he replied. 'Okay,' she said. 'If you're sure.' Then slowly, holding the microphone close to her chest, the bride announced to all their assembled relatives and friends: 'Up the bottom.'

"The Uses and Abuses of Superglue","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/business/a/superglue.htm","2014-07-19 15:14:49","  I found this posted online, original source unknown:
  Fact or fiction?  It's hard to say for sure, but the fact that the selfsame item has been posted and reposted on the Internet as 'fresh news' for 15 years running casts a smidgen of doubt on its authenticity.
  Befitting its status as a modern miracle invention, superglue looms large in urban legendry. In its purest form the stuff can withstand a ton of pressure on a one-square-inch bond. It sets in seconds and can be used to stick anything to just about anything else, permanently. Since its discovery 60-odd years ago, the ultra-sticky substance known to consumers as Super Glue, Krazy Glue, Permabond and Kola Loka has inspired a plethora of folktales which generally fall into one of three categories: Origins, Mishaps and Pranks.
  Superglue origins
  The following was culled from a message board posting:
  Not quite. Although superglue has been used with great success in place of sutures for certain medical procedures, the oft-made claim that it was originally invented for this purpose is false.
  In fact, superglue (known to chemists as cyanoacrylate ) was invented quite by accident. Twice. In both cases, scientists were hoping to come up with new plastic compounds for use in applications such as gun sights and jet canopies but happened unexpectedly upon a formulation that stuck to basically everything it touched.
  The first time it happened, during World War II, researchers found it a nuisance. The second time, during the 1950s, a light bulb went on in somebody's head. The product was first sold commercially in 1958.
  Superglue mishaps
  Found on the web, attributed to the Indianapolis Star , February 7, 1994:
  True! A survey of the medical literature on superglue indicates this kind of mishap is far more common than one might assume. Apparently, people mistake the stuff for other, similarly-packaged products such as eye or ear drops all the time, and end up in the emergency room. In one study, researchers compiled a list of 14 different cases all of which occurred in a single year. This type of mishap, dubbed 'inadvertent self-administration of superglue' by physicians, has inspired consumer groups to call for repackaging of the adhesive.
  Hobbyists and home repair enthusiasts have been known to share tales of accidental adhesions, the consequences of which are usually benign and easily remedied. 'Have you had a little superglue mishap? Get your fingers stuck together?' asks one practical advice columnist. 'Use an old wash cloth and nail polish remover to clean that melted mess in no time!'  For what it's worth, I'm told that only nail polish removers containing acetone will work, but this is still handy advice in sticky situations.
  Superglue pranks
  From The Sun , a London tabloid, in 1996:
  Disbelieve if you will, but according to the BBC a strangely similar incident happened more recently in the United States, where, the story goes, 'a gambler sued a casino for 30,500 pounds after claiming he got stuck to a glue-smeared toilet seat and had to waddle through the casino for help.' (Drat those American toilets — no panic button!)
  'Superglue Revenge'
  And then there are the stories of, um, interpersonal bonding — the suspected criminal who superglued himself to his girlfriend to prevent police from arresting him; the woman who affixed herself to her foreign-born husband to stop authorities from deporting him; and the red-faced woman who showed up in the emergency room with both hands stuck to her boyfriend's private parts.
  Add a motive like revenge to such scenarios and you are smack in the middle of urban legends territory (in case you had any doubt up to this point).
  The best known of all cyanoacrylatic abuse tales is 'Superglue Revenge,' in which an angry wife/girlfriend allegedly waits until her philandering or abusive husband/boyfriend falls asleep then glues his penis to another body part (most often his thigh) — a cautionary tale to be heeded if there ever was one.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand reported several 'Superglue Revenge' variants in his 1984 collection of urban legends, The Choking Doberman . A Hollywood version popular in the early 1990s claimed that actress Sean Young did it to then-boyfriend James Woods during an exceptionally tempestuous break-up. Ms. Young, who believes the story was maliciously promulgated by Woods himself, dismissed it as a lie in a 1993 Playboy interview.
  In one of those disconcerting examples of life imitating legend, a 16-year-old girl in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was charged with assault in July 2000 for gluing her cheating boyfriend's penis to his abdomen. The girl claimed she meant it as a joke, but the boyfriend wound up in the hospital and juvenile authorities were not amused.
  Do not try this at home!

""That'd Be the Butt, Bob"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/in_the_butt_bob.htm","2016-02-06 18:18:55","  By David Emery
  Submitted by a reader...
  During a taping of The Newlywed Game , a popular '70s TV show in which recently married couples tried to predict how their spouses would answer personal questions, host Bob Eubanks asked a female contestant how her husband would respond to the following: 'Where's the most unusual place you've ever made whoopee?' She answered: 'That'd be the butt, Bob.'
  Analysis: This is a story which, for many years, was thought to be completely false, not least because one of the sources best placed to confirm or deny its accuracy, Newlywed Game host Bob Eubanks, repeatedly and strenuously denied it. This was his response, for example, when asked about it in 1997 by Entertainment Weekly :
  It never happened. No matter where I go, it’s mentioned three or four times a day. Everybody swears they saw it. I’m going to write a book and call it That Would Be in the Book , Bob .
  At one point Eubanks even offered $10,000 to anyone who could prove that the incident took place.

  No one was more surprised than he when proof did finally surface that it had. A 1977 episode of the show rebroadcast by the Game Show Network in 1999 contained this exchange between Eubanks and a newlywed couple named Henry and Olga:
  Bob: Here's the last of our five-point questions. Girls, tell me where, specifically, is the weirdest place that you personally, girls, have ever gotten the urge to make whoopee. The weirdest place, Olga?
  Olga: Um... (audience laughter)

"What Is Women's History?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/pockettales/fl/Sex-in-Mythology-What-Could-Be-More-Natural.htm","2016-04-09 02:38:02","  By Jone Johnson Lewis
  In what way is 'women's history' distinct from the broader study of history? Why study 'women's history' and not just history? Are the techniques of women's history any different from the techniques of all historians?
  The discipline called 'women's history' began formally in the 1970s. The feminist perspective led some to notice that women's perspective and earlier feminist movements were largely left out of the history books. While there had been writers for centuries who had written about history from a women's perspective and criticized standard histories for leaving women out, this new 'wave' of feminist historians were more organized. These historians, mostly women, began to offer courses or lectures that highlighted what history looked like when a woman's perspective was included. Gerda Lerner is considered one of the major pioneers of the field, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese founded the first women's studies department, for instance.
  continue reading below our video
  10 Best Universities in the United States
  These historians asked questions like 'What were women doing?' in various periods of history. As they uncovered a nearly-forgotten history of women's struggles for equality and freedom, they realized that a short lecture or single course would not be adequate. Most of the scholars were surprised at the amounts of material that were, indeed, available. And so the fields of women's studies and women's history were founded, to seriously study not only the history and issues of women, but to make those resources and conclusions more widely available so that historians would have a more complete picture to work from.
  They uncovered some sources, but also realized that other sources were lost or unavailable. Because at most times in history women's roles were not in the public realm, their part in history often didn't make it into the historical records. This loss is, in many cases, permanent. We don't, for instance, even know the names of the wives of many of the early kings in British history. Nobody thought to record or preserve those names. It's not likely we'll find them later, though there are occasional surprises.
  To study women's history, a student has to be deal with this lack of sources. That means that historians taking women's roles seriously must be creative: the official documents and older history books often don't include much of what's needed to understand what women were doing in a period of history. Instead, in women's history, we supplement those official documents with more personal items, like journals and diaries and letters, and other ways that women's stories were preserved. Sometimes women wrote for journals and magazines, too, though the material may not have been collected as rigorously as writings by men have.
  The middle school and high school student of history can usually find appropriate resources analyzing different periods of history as good source materials to answer common historical questions. But because women's history has not been studied as widely, even the middle or high school student may have to do the kinds of research usually found in college history classes: finding more detailed sources that illustrate the point, and forming conclusions from them.
  As an example: if a student is trying to discover what a soldier's life was during the American Civil War, there are many books that address that directly. But the student who wants to know what a woman's life was like during the American Civil War may have to dig a bit deeper. She or he may have to read through some diaries of women who stayed at home during the war, or find the rare autobiographies of nurses or spies or even women who fought as soldiers dressed as men.
  Fortunately, since the 1970s, much more has been written on women's history, and so the material that a student can consult is increasing.
  In uncovering women's history, one other conclusion that many of today's students of women's history have come to: the 1970s may have been the beginning of the formal study of women's history, but the topic was hardly new. And many women had been historians -- of women and of more general history. Anna Comnena is considered the first woman to write a book of history.
  For centuries, there had been books written that analyzed women's contributions to history. Most had gathered dust in libraries or had been tossed out in the years in between. But there are some fascinating earlier sources that cover topics in women's history surprisingly astutely.
  Margaret Fuller 's Woman in the Nineteenth Century is one such writer. A writer less known today is Anna Garlin Spencer. She was better known in her own lifetime. She was known as a founder of the social work profession for her work at what became the Columbia School of Social Work. She was also recognized for her work for racial justice, women's rights, children's rights, peace and other issues of her day. An example of women's history before the discipline was invented is her essay, ' The Social Use of the Post-Graduate Mother .' In this essay, Spencer analyzes the role of women who, after they've had their children, are sometimes considered by cultures to have outlived their usefulness. The essay may be a bit difficult to read because some of her references are not as well known to us today, and because her writing is a style current nearly a hundred years ago, and sounds somewhat alien to our ears. But many ideas in the essay are quite modern. For instance, current research on the witch crazes of Europe and American also looks at issues of women's history: why was it that most of the victims of the witchhunts were women? And often women who didn't have male protectors in their families? Spencer speculates on just that question, with answers much like those current today in women's history.
  In the earlier 20th century, historian Mary Ritter Beard was among those who explored the role of women in history.
  What we call 'women's history' is an approach to the study of history. Women's history is based on the idea that history, as it is usually studied and written, largely ignores women and women's contributions.
  Women's history assumes that ignoring women and women's contributions leaves out important parts of the full story of history. Without looking at the women and their contributions, history is not complete. Writing women back into history means gaining a fuller understanding of history.
  A purpose of many historians, since the time of the first known historian, Herodotus, has been to shed light on the present and the future by telling about the past. Historians have had as an explicit goal to tell an 'objective truth' -- truth as it might be seen by an objective, or unbiased, observer.
  But is objective history possible? That's a question those studying women's history have been asking loudly. Their answer, first, was that 'no,' every history and historians makes selections, and most have left out the perspective of women. Women who played an active role in the public events were often forgotten quickly, and the less obvious roles women played 'behind the scenes' or in private life are not easily studied. 'Behind every great man there's a woman,' an old saying goes. If there is a woman behind -- or working against -- a great man, do we truly understand even that great man and his contributions, if the woman is ignored or forgotten?
  In the field of women's history, the conclusion has been that no history can be truly objective. Histories are written by real people with their real biases and imperfections, and their histories are full of conscious and unconscious errors. The assumptions historians make shape what evidence they look for, and therefore what evidence they find. If historians do not assume that women are part of history, then the historians won't even be looking for evidence of women's role.
  Does that mean that women's history is biased, because it, too, has assumptions about women's role? And that 'regular' history is, on the other hand, objective? From the perspective of women's history, the answer is 'No.' All historians and all histories are biased. Being conscious of that bias, and working to uncover and acknowledge our biases, is the first stop towards more objectivity, even if full objectivity is not possible.
  Women's history, in questioning whether histories have been complete without paying attention to the women, is also trying to find a 'truth.' Women's history, essentially, values searching for more of the 'whole truth' over maintaining illusions that we already have found it.
  So, finally, another important assumption of women's history is that it's important to 'do' women's history. Retrieving new evidence, examining old evidence from the perspective of the women, looking even for what lack of evidence might speak of in its silence -- these are all important ways to fill in the 'rest of the story.'

  They uncovered some sources, but also realized that other sources were lost or unavailable. Because at most times in history women's roles were not in the public realm, their part in history often didn't make it into the historical records. This loss is, in many cases, permanent. We don't, for instance, even know the names of the wives of many of the early kings in British history. Nobody thought to record or preserve those names. It's not likely we'll find them later, though there are occasional surprises.
  To study women's history, a student has to be deal with this lack of sources. That means that historians taking women's roles seriously must be creative: the official documents and older history books often don't include much of what's needed to understand what women were doing in a period of history. Instead, in women's history, we supplement those official documents with more personal items, like journals and diaries and letters, and other ways that women's stories were preserved. Sometimes women wrote for journals and magazines, too, though the material may not have been collected as rigorously as writings by men have.
  The middle school and high school student of history can usually find appropriate resources analyzing different periods of history as good source materials to answer common historical questions. But because women's history has not been studied as widely, even the middle or high school student may have to do the kinds of research usually found in college history classes: finding more detailed sources that illustrate the point, and forming conclusions from them.
  As an example: if a student is trying to discover what a soldier's life was during the American Civil War, there are many books that address that directly. But the student who wants to know what a woman's life was like during the American Civil War may have to dig a bit deeper. She or he may have to read through some diaries of women who stayed at home during the war, or find the rare autobiographies of nurses or spies or even women who fought as soldiers dressed as men.
  Fortunately, since the 1970s, much more has been written on women's history, and so the material that a student can consult is increasing.
  In uncovering women's history, one other conclusion that many of today's students of women's history have come to: the 1970s may have been the beginning of the formal study of women's history, but the topic was hardly new. And many women had been historians -- of women and of more general history. Anna Comnena is considered the first woman to write a book of history.
  For centuries, there had been books written that analyzed women's contributions to history. Most had gathered dust in libraries or had been tossed out in the years in between. But there are some fascinating earlier sources that cover topics in women's history surprisingly astutely.
  Margaret Fuller 's Woman in the Nineteenth Century is one such writer. A writer less known today is Anna Garlin Spencer. She was better known in her own lifetime. She was known as a founder of the social work profession for her work at what became the Columbia School of Social Work. She was also recognized for her work for racial justice, women's rights, children's rights, peace and other issues of her day. An example of women's history before the discipline was invented is her essay, ' The Social Use of the Post-Graduate Mother .' In this essay, Spencer analyzes the role of women who, after they've had their children, are sometimes considered by cultures to have outlived their usefulness. The essay may be a bit difficult to read because some of her references are not as well known to us today, and because her writing is a style current nearly a hundred years ago, and sounds somewhat alien to our ears. But many ideas in the essay are quite modern. For instance, current research on the witch crazes of Europe and American also looks at issues of women's history: why was it that most of the victims of the witchhunts were women? And often women who didn't have male protectors in their families? Spencer speculates on just that question, with answers much like those current today in women's history.
  In the earlier 20th century, historian Mary Ritter Beard was among those who explored the role of women in history.
  What we call 'women's history' is an approach to the study of history. Women's history is based on the idea that history, as it is usually studied and written, largely ignores women and women's contributions.
  Women's history assumes that ignoring women and women's contributions leaves out important parts of the full story of history. Without looking at the women and their contributions, history is not complete. Writing women back into history means gaining a fuller understanding of history.
  A purpose of many historians, since the time of the first known historian, Herodotus, has been to shed light on the present and the future by telling about the past. Historians have had as an explicit goal to tell an 'objective truth' -- truth as it might be seen by an objective, or unbiased, observer.
  But is objective history possible? That's a question those studying women's history have been asking loudly. Their answer, first, was that 'no,' every history and historians makes selections, and most have left out the perspective of women. Women who played an active role in the public events were often forgotten quickly, and the less obvious roles women played 'behind the scenes' or in private life are not easily studied. 'Behind every great man there's a woman,' an old saying goes. If there is a woman behind -- or working against -- a great man, do we truly understand even that great man and his contributions, if the woman is ignored or forgotten?
  In the field of women's history, the conclusion has been that no history can be truly objective. Histories are written by real people with their real biases and imperfections, and their histories are full of conscious and unconscious errors. The assumptions historians make shape what evidence they look for, and therefore what evidence they find. If historians do not assume that women are part of history, then the historians won't even be looking for evidence of women's role.
  Does that mean that women's history is biased, because it, too, has assumptions about women's role? And that 'regular' history is, on the other hand, objective? From the perspective of women's history, the answer is 'No.' All historians and all histories are biased. Being conscious of that bias, and working to uncover and acknowledge our biases, is the first stop towards more objectivity, even if full objectivity is not possible.
  Women's history, in questioning whether histories have been complete without paying attention to the women, is also trying to find a 'truth.' Women's history, essentially, values searching for more of the 'whole truth' over maintaining illusions that we already have found it.
  So, finally, another important assumption of women's history is that it's important to 'do' women's history. Retrieving new evidence, examining old evidence from the perspective of the women, looking even for what lack of evidence might speak of in its silence -- these are all important ways to fill in the 'rest of the story.'

  In what way is 'women's history' distinct from the broader study of history? Why study 'women's history' and not just history? Are the techniques of women's history any different from the techniques of all historians?
  The discipline called 'women's history' began formally in the 1970s. The feminist perspective led some to notice that women's perspective and earlier feminist movements were largely left out of the history books. While there had been writers for centuries who had written about history from a women's perspective and criticized standard histories for leaving women out, this new 'wave' of feminist historians were more organized. These historians, mostly women, began to offer courses or lectures that highlighted what history looked like when a woman's perspective was included. Gerda Lerner is considered one of the major pioneers of the field, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese founded the first women's studies department, for instance.
