  The Internet is a font of medical information, as we all know, both good and bad. And when we say bad, we mean really, really bad! Here are seven examples of some of the worst medical advice ever given out on the Internet. Want to stay healthy? Get your medical advice from a professional physician.
  Straight from the New England Journal of Medicine — or so we're told — comes a peer-reviewed study demonstrating that just 10 minutes a day of 'staring at the charms of a well-endowed female' is equivalent to a 20-minute aerobic workout for men. By this method, says head researcher Dr. Karen Weatherby, the average male can expect to extend his lifespan four to five years. More »

  According to a viral message circulating since the mid-2000s, drinking cold water after a meal 'will solidify the oily stuff that you have just consumed' and retard digestion. This 'sludge' is then broken down by stomach acid and coats the intestines, where it will 'turn into fats and lead to cancer.' It is best, therefore, to drink hot soup or warm water with meals. So says the Internet. More »
  Here's some good news for cold water drinkers (see below). Everyone knows that lemons are beneficial to your health, but did you know that they're a 'proven remedy' for all forms of cancer? So claims a popular viral message declaring the anti-carcinogenic properties of lemons '10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy.' The info is attributed to Baltimore's Institute of Health Sciences, which, unsurprisingly, denies having released any such statement. Ever. More »
  All hail the miraculous absorptive power of raw onions, which, if distributed in open bowls or dishes around the home, will draw germs and viruses from the air and protect your entire family from the flu. This technique was supposedly used with great success during the devastating worldwide influenza epidemic of 1918-1919, though there is no historical evidence that this was actually the case, nor any scientific reason to suppose that onions absorb disease-causing agents of any kind.

  If you found the previously mentioned 'medical study' recommending that men stare at women's breasts to improve their heart health shocking, wait till you read this one. A purported CNN news story dated Oct. 3, 2003 claimed that researchers at North Carolina state University found that women who performed oral sex on men one to two times a week reduced their chances of getting breast cancer by 40 percent! Lest you're tempted to believe this nonsense, consider the name of the head researcher: Dr. B.J. Sooner. More »
  Never mind that respected and trustworthy medical sources such as the Mayo Clinic advise treating minor burns by first immersing the skin in cool water then covering it with dry, sterile gauze, this forwarded email says it's preferable to cover the injured area with plain white flour for 10 minutes and 'experience a miracle.' Quick healing without pain or blisters guaranteed! More »
  Shocking 'police alerts' from India warn that an HIV-positive worker at a Pepsi-Cola plant in New Delhi purposely contaminated products with his blood. To avoid contracting AIDS, the messages advise, consumers should avoid all beverages produced by the company, including Pepsi, Slice, Tropicana Orange Juice, and 7-Up. This is news to the CDC, which has stated repeatedly that HIV cannot be transmitted in this manner. More »

  Please take care while u eat on the road side. and pls fwd this mail to your dear one.
  Analysis: These scary viral alerts are based on a common myth about HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), namely that it can be spread via contaminated food or drink. Not so , according to the Centers for Disease Control. The virus can't survive long outside the human body, so you can't catch AIDS by eating food handled by an infected person — 'even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen,' says the CDC.
  HIV is destroyed by exposure to air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid. In short, AIDS is not a food-borne illness.
  Even if it were a food-borne illness, there would still be cause for skepticism about this story. It's claimed that the 10-year-old patient in the story 'fell sick' with AIDS just 15 days after consuming pineapple tainted by the blood of an HIV-positive vendor. It normally takes months or years for AIDS symptoms to appear.
  The list of foods and beverages supposedly contaminated by HIV-infected workers keeps growing, regardless. To date, the list include: ketchup , tomato sauce , Pepsi-Cola , Frooti drinks , and take-out shawarmas .
  Though all these warnings are fictional and there's no real danger of getting AIDS by consuming these products, it's still probably a good idea to be careful in general what you eat from roadside stands.
  It's an equally good idea to be careful what you believe on the Internet.

"Is It True that Poinsettias Are Poisonous to Pets?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/christmaslore/p/Poinsettias-Poisonous-Myth.htm","Are Poinsettias 'Poisonous' to Dogs, Cats and Children?","2010-12-01 23:19:29","  By David Emery
  Claim: Poinsettia plants are poisonous, especially to small children and pets.
  Status: False.
  Analysis: Despite its fatal reputation, the humble Christmas poinsettia ( Euphorbia pulcherrima ) is only mildly toxic when ingested, according to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center . At worst, it can cause irritation of the mouth and stomach, and in some cases vomiting.
  Popular misconceptions to the contrary apparently stem from a single, unsubstantiated report in 1919 to the effect that a small child had died after chewing on a poinsettia leaf. A survey of the peer-reviewed medical literature from then until now turns up zero documented cases of human or animal fatalities resulting from the consumption of poinsettia plants. In point of fact, a 1996 study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine found that out of 22,793 reported cases of poinsettia exposure in children, not only were there no fatalities, but 92.4% of the subjects experienced no toxic effects at all .

  ( Nota bene: Another decorative plant popular during the winter holidays, mistletoe, is not so harmless .)
  The poinsettia is native to Mexico (where it's known as La Flor de Noche Buena ), as is its connection to the Christmas holiday:
  The legend regarding Euphorbia pulcherrima begins long ago with a peasant girl in Mexico, faced with a problem on Holy Night: she lacked the means to contribute a gift in the Christ Child ceremony at the church, as all the other children would be doing. The girl was, however, reassured that, to use a modern expression, 'it's the thought that counts.'
  Taking this advice, she picked some roadside weeds on the way to church to make a bouquet. But when she arrived at the church and it was time for her to present her gift, the bouquet of weeds was transformed into something much more colorful: red Christmas poinsettias! Thus was born an enduring Christmas tradition, as we continue to associate these flowers with the holiday season.
  (Source: David Beaulieu )
  The poinsettia was first brought to the United States around 1830 by American diplomat Joel Roberts Poinsett.

"Is It True That Asparagus Can Cure Cancer?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/asparagus_cancer.htm","Can Asparagus Cure Cancer?","2009-04-29 21:42:39","  Viral article attributed to a biochemist offers medical case histories collected with the help of alleged cancer expert 'Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S.' purporting to prove that eating asparagus may prevent and/or cure cancer.
  Description: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: 2008 Status: FALSE (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by Elizabeth, Feb. 24, 2009:
  Analysis: Exactly who Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. is and what his qualifications are as a cancer and nutrition expert we do not know, for the simple reason that his name doesn't appear anywhere in print apart from this one online article.
  The periodical in which it was allegedly published, the Cancer News Journal , no longer exists but apparently devoted itself to 'alternative' cancer therapies. An article with the identical title ('Asparagus for Cancer') and similar if not identical content appeared under the byline 'Karl Lutz' in the February 1974 edition of Prevention magazine. In any case, contrary to the impression given above there are no peer-reviewed medical studies proving that eating asparagus alone 'prevents' or 'cures' cancer.
  That's not to say asparagus offers no cancer-fighting benefits whatsoever — there's a good chance it does, given that it contains vitamin D , folic acid , and the antioxidant glutathione , all thought to play some role in lowering risk factors for certain cancers. By all means, eat your asparagus! The thing is, lots of other foods provide the same nutritional benefits and more besides, so emphasizing one particular vegetable over all the other health-promoting foods available is surely counter-productive.
  Generally speaking, medical experts recommend a diet high in fiber, fruits and vegetables and low in fats and nitrates for optimal resistance to cancer. At the risk of stating the obvious, it should also be noted that dietary measures ought never to be regarded as a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and treatment of any disease, especially cancer.

  IMPORTANT INFORMATION : MUST SHARE
  A 21 year old girl had worn a pair of contact lenses during a barbecue party.(An event or meal at which food is cooked outdoors over an open grill or fire) While barbecuing she stared at the fire charcoals continuously for 2-3 minutes.
  After a few minutes, She started to scream for help and moved rapidly, jumping up and down. No one in the party knew why she was doing this? Then she admitted into the Hospital, the doctor said she'll be blind permanently because of the contact lenses that she had worn.
  Contact lenses are made by plastics, and the heat from the charcoal melted her contact lenses.
  DO NOT WEAR CONTACT LENSES WHERE OVERHEATING and FLAMES are concerned.... or while COOKING...!
  Friends if u feel the information is important, Please SHARE this message to all your near & dear ones who use contact lens .. !!

  Contact Lenses
  Pls pass this to all your friends to those who wear contact lenses, pls remove them when you have or attend a BBQ party or whatsoever that got to do with flames...
  I heard a horrible true story about contact lenses.... It happened to a 21year old guy at Malacca, he wore a pair of contact lenses during a barbecue party. While, he was barbecuing, he stared at the fire charcoals. After a few seconds, he started to scream for help and moved rapidly, jumping up and down. No one in the party knew why...When he arrived at the Hospital, the doctor said he'll be blind permanently courtesy of the contact lenses that he had worn. Contact lenses are made by plastics, and the heat from the charcoal melted his contact lenses. So, DO NOT WEAR CONTACT LENSES WHERE OVERHEAT AND FLAMES ARE CONCERNED...
  Analysis: Please note that with the exception of a few minor revisions over time, the wording of this perennially circulating text hasn't changed since it originally appeared on the Internet in 2002.
  No names are divulged, nor, apart from the claim in the very earliest variant of the text that it took place in Malacca (a city in Malaysia), are we told where the barbecue incident supposedly happened. There's no good reason to suppose it did happen.
  The general notion that plastic contact lenses can melt under extreme heat and become 'fused' to one's eyeballs is even older, dating from the late 1960s when industrial safety warnings circulated in the wake of anecdotal reports claiming that welders had suffered severe cornea damage and blindness when their contacts were melted by the heat and/or radiation of electric arc flashes. Though baseless, those warnings continued to circulate well into the 1980s (see J.H. Brunvand, The Choking Doberman and Other 'New' Urban Legends , W.W. Norton, 1984).
  As noted in an American Welding Society fact sheet published in 2000, the arc flash rumor has been repeatedly debunked by medical and safety experts:
  Since 1967, the American Welding Society has received reports concerning welders who have claimed to have had contact lenses fused to their eyes, either by the heat of the arc or by microwave radiation. Not one of these reports has been substantiated, and safety bulletins issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Safety Council (NSC) have all indicated such incidents could not possibly have occurred.
  This echoes the conclusion reached in a 1995 publication of the American Chemical Society which stated that 'the basic laws of physics indicate that such a fusion could not have happened. Heat from a welding arc or electrical spark is not intense enough to dry up the eye's fluid, nor could a contact lens concentrate rays to intensify the heat.'
  The same reasoning applies to the claim that the heat from a backyard barbecue could melt someone's contact lenses. 'It's nonsense,' writes plainspoken optometrist Dr. Simon Kay . 'If it was hot enough to melt his contact lenses his face would be on fire!'
  A 2012 article from Mulamoottil Eye Hospital & Research Center in Kerala, India summed up the entire case as follows:

"Do Plastic Water Bottles Really Cause Cancer?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/bottled-water.htm","Viral Warning: Don't Drink Bottled Water Left in Car","2007-06-05 23:49:05","  By David Emery
  A forwarded message circulating online warns consumers not to drink bottled water that has been sitting in a warm car for any length of time because, supposedly, the heat causes cancer-producing toxins to 'leak' from the plastic into the water. How accurate is it?
  Description: Email rumor / Viral text Circulating since: April 2007 Status: False as written / Scientific research is ongoing
  2013 example of the rumor As posted on Facebook, May 4, 2013:
  Plastic Bottled Water DIOXIN Danger
  LET EVERYONE WHO HAS A WIFE/GIRLFRIEND/ DAUGHTER KNOW PLEASE!
  Bottled water in your car is very dangerous! On the Ellen show, Sheryl Crow said that this is what caused her breast cancer. It has been identified as the most common cause of the high levels of dioxin in breast cancer tissue..
  Sheryl Crow’s oncologist told her: women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The heat reacts with the chemicals in the plastic of the bottle which releases dioxin into the water. Dioxin is a toxin increasingly found in breast cancer tissue. So please be careful and do not drink bottled water that has been left in a car.
  Pass this on to all the women in your life. This information is the kind we need to know that just might save us! Use a stainless steel canteen or a glass bottle instead of plastic!
  This information is also being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ... No plastic containers in microwaves. No plastic water bottles in freezers. No plastic wrap in microwaves.
  Dioxin chemical causes cancer, especially breast cancer. Dioxins are highly poisonous to cells in our bodies. Don’t freeze plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic. Recently the Wellness Program Manager at Castle Hospital, was on a TV program to explain this health hazard.
  He talked about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating food in the microwave using plastic containers..... This especially applies to foods that contain fat.
  He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastic releases dioxin into the food.
  Instead, he recommends using glass, such as Pyrex or ceramic containers for heating food... You get the same result, but without the dioxin.. So, such things as TV dinners, instant soups, etc., should be removed from their containers and heated in something else.
  Paper isn’t bad but you don’t know what is in the paper. It’s safer to use tempered glass, such as Pyrex, etc.
  He reminded us that a while ago some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the styrene foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons....
  Also, he pointed out that plastic wrap, such as Cling film, is just as dangerous when placed over foods to be cooked in the microwave. As the food is nuked, the high heat causes poisonous toxins to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food. Cover food with a paper towel instead.
  This is an article that should be share to anyone important in your life!

  2007 example of the rumor Email text contributed by Jori M., April 22, 2007:
  ...a friend whose mother recently got diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor told her women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The doctor said that the heat and the plastic of the bottle have certain chemicals that can lead to breast cancer. So please be careful and do not drink that water bottle that has been left in a car and pass this on to all the women in your life.
  This information is the kind we need to know and be aware and just might save us!!!!
  *The heats causes toxins from the plastic to leak into the water and they have found these toxins in breast tissue. Use a stainless steel canteen or a glass bottle when you can*!
  Note: Newer variants of the above warning reiterate a previously circulated claim that microwaving food in plastic containers and/or plastic wrap releases dioxin into the food. Those allegations are discussed here .
  Analysis: False as written, though research into potential health hazards associated with disposable water bottles is ongoing (see updates at the bottom of this page).
  Plastic bottles of the type used for packaging commercially marketed drinking water in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as 'food contact substances' and held to the same safety standards as food additives. This means, among other things, that the FDA reviews test data on the safety of the plastics used in disposable water bottles — including the potential for hazardous chemicals to leaching or 'migrate' from the plastic into the water — and has thus far established that they pose no significant risk to human health. The water itself is also tested and required to meet basic quality standards similar to those set by the Environmental Protection Agency for public drinking water.
  Disposable vs. reusable
  It's important to note that the plastic used in the manufacture of pre-packaged, disposable water bottles is different from the plastics believed to pose a human health threat in other applications such as baby bottles, plastic children's toys, and reusable sports water bottles. Disposable water bottles do not contain bisphenol A (BPA) , for example, about which safety concerns have been raised.
  That's not to say that water sold in plastic bottles is one hundred percent free of all contaminants, or that chemical leaching from plastics to liquid never takes place. Studies done on water bottled in FDA-approved polyethylene terephthalate (PET) , for example, did find that trace amounts of potentially hazardous substances had apparently migrated from the plastic into the water. The important point to take away, however, is that those amounts were minuscule, and well within the human safety limits set by FDA and EPA regulators.
  Germs a greater concern?
  According to Dr. Rolf Halden of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, consumers face a much greater risk from potential exposure to microbial contaminants in bottled water — germs, to you and me — than from chemical ones. For that reason, most experts suggest not refilling or reusing empty bottles.
  It should also be noted that the plastics used in the manufacturer of reusable water bottles vary in composition and quality and may be more susceptible to chemical leaching than the disposable type.
  Regarding Sheryl Crow
  Some versions of this warning contain the additional claim that musician Sheryl Crow announced during a pre-2008 appearance on the Ellen Degeneres TV show that she got breast cancer as a result of drinking bottled water. While it's true that Crow has discussed her bout with cancer on Degeneres' show more than once and reportedly cautioned viewers against drinking water from heated plastic bottles during one of those appearances, I've found no evidence confirming that she explicitly blamed her own cancer on water bottles. Citing advice from her own nutritionist, Crow did issue a warning against drinking water from heated bottles in a Sep. 2006 statement on her website, but, again, did not claim it was the cause of her own illness.
  Update (2009): German study on chemical leaching
  A new European study raises concerns about the safety of disposable water bottles, which are currently regarded as safe by the FDA and other government health agencies. Researchers in Germany found evidence of a man-made estrogen-like compound leaching into water packaged in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. This type of substance, known as an 'endocrine disruptor,' has the potential to interfere with estrogen and other reproductive hormones in the human body. Please note that the authors of the study conclude by saying that more research is required to determine whether, and to what degree, this poses an actual health risk to human beings.

  Update (2014): China/Univ. of Florida study on chemical leaching
  A study on water stored in PET bottles for a relatively long period of time (four weeks) at temperatures up to 158 degrees Fahrenheit found that levels of the chemicals BPA and antimony, a carcinogen, gradually increased. Though only one brand of the 16 tested yielded amounts of these chemicals exceeding EPA safety standards, researchers said more testing is needed to ensure the safety of the products.

"Return of an Urban Legend: The Blue Star LSD Tattoo","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Blue-Star-LSD-Tattoo.htm","The Blue Star LSD Tattoo","2010-11-10 15:50:51","  Message from a reader dated Sep. 21, 1998:
  Email chain letter dated Oct. 7, 1998:
  Press release from Danbury Hospital, Connecticut, June 11, 1998:
  From Mickey Mouse Acid to the Blue Star Tattoo
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand first addressed rumors about incidents involving so-called 'Mickey Mouse Acid' in his 1984 book, The Choking Doberman and Other 'New' Urban Legends . He described it as 'the most insidious urban drug legend' going because it implied, as do more recent variants, that drug dealers purposely decorate their wares with colorful cartoon images to make them attractive to small children.
  In the words of photocopied flyers proliferating throughout the 1980s, 'Mickey Mouse Acid (LSD) has been circulated widely throughout some parts of New England as a part of or in the form of a 'sticker' or label. It may be available to school age children...
  All Disney cartoon characters have been used in the distribution of this LSD.'
  Citing a 1982 press clipping describing a 'children's 'tatoo' [sic] which may contain LSD,' Brunvand theorized that the notion may have originated in an earlier (1980) police memorandum pointing out a particularly worrisome feature of a form of LSD known as 'blotter acid' (tabs of paper impregnated with LSD and imprinted with colorful images of cartoon characters): 'Children may be susceptible to this type of cartoon stamp believing it a tattoo transfer.'
  Dave Gross, keeper of the online Blue Star LSD FAQ , concurs. All it took after those first cautionary mentions, he adds, was a church group copying the vaguely-understood information into an anti-drug flyer for the urban legend to be 'on a roll.' By 1987 the tattoo warning had mutated into more or less its current form, with references to strychnine contamination, images of a 'Blue Star' (a commercial trademark), and illustrations ranging from butterflies to clowns to cartoon characters from Disney and elsewhere.
  As noted above, the flyer specifically purporting to originate from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut first surfaced in 1992. Since that time it has circled the globe many times over via photocopied posters, faxes, and forwarded email.
  Both Brunvand and Gross, having tracked the legend for years, maintain there has never been a documented case of a child mistaking blotter acid for a 'tattoo transfer' and accidentally ingesting a dose of LSD. The media have sometimes reported this accurately, sometimes not.
  Longevity
  How to explain the longevity of this urban legend and its periodic surges in popularity? For starters, there are no horror stories more compelling than those involving threats to the well-being of children.
  Consider the tale of drug smugglers using the corpses of children to transport cocaine across the U.S. border, a legend which has been around even longer than warnings about LSD tattoos (and which also undergoes frequent revivals).
  To whatever extent new eruptions of these legends can be described as cyclical, perhaps they correlate with changes in cultural attitudes toward drugs.
  In the 1980s, following what are often described as the 'excesses' of the 1970s, there was a backlash against drug use which coincides with the moment these stories made their earliest public appearances. The 'Just Say No' attitude of the Reagan era gave way to a renewed curiosity about drugs among young people coming of age in the 1990s, which in turn sparked another anti-drug backlash. And so it goes.
  Underlying truths
  As I've often pointed out in these pages, contemporary legends tend to represent our collective anxieties, particularly those for which there aren't any obvious or simple remedies. Though the stories themselves may not be corroborated in real life, the fears they represent often are.
  Just last month (September 1998), CNN ran a terrifying news story about some fourth-graders who fell ill after consuming LSD which had been injected into a vial of commercial breath freshener. According to police, one of the children had innocently shared the contaminated product with her classmates after finding it on her way to school.
  Are children literally in danger of getting dosed with LSD through drug-laced tattoos? It appears not. Are they endangered by the careless drug use of the adults around them? Clearly they can be. It's an example of how a false story can paint a true picture of the things we're most afraid of.

  It has been reported that this is happening in Zimbabwe as well, please make sure you iron your undergarments before you wear them and make sure that your clothes are ironed when they are dry and not damp. The picture is horrible but I felt that I should share with you. After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the holes would leave in time. Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the disease, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time lapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan's pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor. Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation. She waited for two weeks and finally was able to react the dermatologist. Sadly,a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment. To Miss McKinley's surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast. Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices. What she didn't know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: This viral message has three distinct components:
  1. The text, which appears to have been fabricated. 2. The photograph, which also appears to have been fabricated. 3. The linked video, which is authentic, albeit completely unrelated to the text and image.
  The fabricated image first turned up on the Internet, uncaptioned, in June 2003. As David Mikkelson of Snopes.com observes, it appears to have been created by combining elements of two separate images, one of a female breast and the other of a lotus seed pod .
  The cautionary tale about 'anthropologist Susan McKinley' and the breast larvae infestation she supposedly experienced (also described as 'boob worms' and 'nipple bugs' in other versions of the story) was attached to the image by person(s) unknown in August 2003.
  The video — which demonstrates that larvae infestations of the breast, though extremely rare, do occur — was downloaded from the website of a medical journal in 2005 and attached to the already-circulating email, again by person(s) unknown. As originally published, it accompanied a scientific study entitled ' Furuncular Myiasis of the Breast Caused by the Larvae of the Tumbu Fly (Cordylobia Anthropophaga) .' The case, which was recorded in Nigeria, not South America, is described as follows:
  Please note that while the particulars of the 'Susan McKinley' email remain unsubstantiated and the story is almost certainly a fabrication, its anonymous author does appear to know a thing or two about the causes of furuncular myiasis of the breast. The email warns: 'Please make sure you iron your undergarments before you wear them and make sure that your clothes are ironed when they are dry and not damp.' Compare that to the journal article's explanation of how the 70-year-old patient in Nigeria was exposed to infestation: 'She usually spreads her washed dresses on a line near the bush and does not iron them before wearing them.'

"The Legend of the Cadaver's Arm","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Cadaver-Arm.htm","The Cadaver's Arm","2015-08-01 04:00:08","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Severed Arm'
  A friend of a friend knew this girl in nursing school named Sarah. Sarah was in that part of the program where they were dissecting corpses to study anatomy, and she was kind of squeamish — no, very squeamish — around the dead bodies. It wasn't that no one else nauseated by the experience; they were, but they were too 'cool' to let on. But one day Sarah just completely lost it and threw up in front the class. That's when some of the other students started picking on her.
  At some point a group of them got together and decided to play a prank on her. One day, when the anatomy professor wasn't looking, they removed a cadaver's arm and managed to sneak it out of the classroom in a backpack.
  There was a party at the dormitory that night, and everyone had a little too much to drink, even Sarah, who normally didn't imbibe that much. She decided to go to bed early, so went back to her dorm room alone, washed up, and got into bed in the dark.

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  She froze. She felt something cold and rubbery and wet in the bed with her. She flipped on the light and saw the severed, bloody cadaver arm that the other girls had placed there. She began to scream, and kept on screaming, and couldn't stop.
  When the other girls got to her room, they found Sarah, white as a ghost and laughing maniacally while gnawing on the severed arm.
  She spent the rest of her life in an insane asylum.
  Analysis: There are umpteen variations of this story, including one wherein the pranksters attach the severed cadaver's arm to a light cord in the victim's dorm room, so the first thing she does when she enters the dark room is reach up and grab it. And scream bloody murder, of course.
  In other versions the severed arm prank is supposedly a sorority initiation rite. Most often the pranksters are girls, but sometimes they're all boys, or a mix of both genders. In every case the victim is female.
  'The Cadaver Arm' is actually quite old and well-traveled, dating back as far as the turn of the 20th century. A version of it is recounted, for example, in the Spanish novel The Tree of Knowledge , the English translation of which was published in 1928:
  There was a story of a second-year student who had played the following prank on a friend, who, he knew, was rather timid. He took a dead mans arm, wrapped it in his cloak and went up to greet his friend.
  'How do you do?' he said, putting out the hand of the corpse from beneath his cloak.
  'Well, and you?' — answered the other and shook his hand but shuddered at the coldness of it — and was horrified when he saw the arm of a dead man coming out from the cloak.
  Many more variants, most from the late 1960s and early 1970s, can be found in the Indiana Folklore Collection on the website of the Wabash Valley Visions & Voices Digital Memory Project.

"Was This 'Cancer Update' from Johns Hopkins Real?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/ss/Cancer-Update-From-Johns-Hopkins.htm","Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins?","2013-12-30 19:57:39","  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: 2007 Status: FALSE (see details below)
  Example: Forwarded email contributed by Clintene B., June 7, 2007:
  AFTER YEARS OF TELLING PEOPLE CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRY (TRY THE KEY WORD) AND ELIMINATE CANCER JOHN HOPKINS IS FINALLY STARTING TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY .
  Cancer Update from John Hopkins
  1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.
  2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.
  3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumours.
  4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.
  5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.
  6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.
  7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.
  8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.
  9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.
  10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.
  11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.
  CANCER CELLS FEED ON:
  a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.
  b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soya milk cancer cells are being starved.
  c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.
  d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains,seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment.About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts)and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).
  e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine.Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.
  12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrified and leads to more toxic buildup.
  13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.
  14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence,Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.
  15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.
  16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.

  CANCER UPDATE FROM JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL , U S - PLEASE READ
  1. No plastic containers in micro.
  2. No water bottles in freezer.
  3. No plastic wrap in microwave.
  Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in its newsletters. This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as well.
  Dioxin chemicals causes cancer, especially breast cancer.
  Dioxins are highly poisonous to the cells of our bodies.
  Don't freeze your plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic.
  Recently, Dr. Edward Fujimoto, Wellness Program Manager at Castle Hospital , was on a TV program to explain this health hazard. He talked about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers.
  This especially applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of fat, high heat, and plastics releases dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Instead, he recommends using glass, such as Corning Ware, Pyrex or ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results, only without the dioxin. So such things as TV dinners, instant ramen and soups, etc., should be removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. It's just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc. He reminded us that a while ago some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons.
  Also, he pointed out that plastic wrap, such as Saran, is just as dangerous when placed over foods to be cooked in the microwave. As the food is nuked, the high heat causes poisonous toxins to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food. Cover food with a paper towel instead.
  This is an article that should be sent to anyone important in your life.
  Analysis: This misinformative article has been circulating since 2007, most recently surfacing in the form of a blog post entitled ' How to Avoid Cancer .' Contrary to what's claimed, however, none of the information originated from Johns Hopkins , which has disavowed the article in its entirety.
  The basic premise of the article is that standard medical treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation damage the body and are less effective than 'alternative' dietary treatments which supposedly fight cancer by strengthening the immune system. But while it's true that chemotherapy and radiation have harsh side effects and diet can be a contributing factor in the development of cancer, the notion that dietary changes alone can 'eliminate' cancer and are preferable to standard treatments flies in the face of current medical knowledge.

  Fw: Careful with dust!!!
  Its just like from an alien movie be very careful when u get caught with dust.... as following pics will show effects of bad dust to a person.
  While he was walking he felt an eye irritation, thinking that it was just regular dust, he started to rub his eye, in an effort to remove the dust.... then his eyes got really red, and he went and bought some eye drops from a pharmacy.... few days passed n his eyes were still red and seems a little swollen.
  Again he dismissed it as the constant rubbing and that it will go away. The days go by the swelling of his eye got worse, redder and bigger.... till he decided to go and see a doctor for a check up.
  The doctor immediately wanted an operation, being afraid of a tumor growth or cyst. At the operation, what was thought to be a growth or cyst, actually turned out to be a live worm..... what was thought initially to be just mere dust actually was an insect's egg...... because of that, my friends, if u do get caught in dust, and the pain persists, pls go see a doctor immediately...... thank you....

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Description: Viral images and text Circulating since: Nov. 2002 Status: Images are authentic; the story not so much
  Analysis: Bizarre as it may seem, the photos above are authentic, though the same cannot be said of the accompanying text, which is an utter fabrication.
  There's no way to determine who assembled the collage, which has circulated anonymously since 2002, but I did manage to locate the source of the individual images, an article entitled 'Anterior Orbital Myiasis Caused by Human Botfly,' published in the July 2000 edition of the Archives of Ophthalmology , a journal of the American Medical Association.
  Myiasis is the medical term for a maggot (fly larva) infestation of a living body. In this case, the patient was a 5-year-old boy treated by U.S. Air Force surgeons in a rural area of the Republic of Honduras. 'The respiratory pore of a late-stage larva of the human botfly ( Dermatobia hominis ) was located in the anterior orbit,' says the article abstract. 'The larva was gently removed under general anesthesia through a small incision in the conjunctiva.'
  That is to say, the patient had a worm in his eye. Doctors put him under and removed it through a small incision on the surface of his eyeball. Apparently, the patient was none the worse for wear in the aftermath.
  It would appear that the journal article itself was not consulted at all when the email tale above was composed. Neither 'bad dust' nor excessive eye rubbing are cited by the authors as causes of the larva infestation in the 5-year-old patient. It resulted from contact with insects.
  According to entomologists, the human botfly lays its eggs on the bodies of other insects (such as mosquitoes), which then transfer the eggs to animal or human hosts by direct contact. When a botfly egg hatches, the larva burrows into the host's skin (or, in this case, eye) head-first and begins feeding.
  This nasty creature is found mainly in Central and South America, but there are other species of flies known to responsible for cases of myiasis in North America, mainly blowflies. According to an epidemiological study conducted in 2000, most instances of myiasis acquired in the U.S. resulted from blowflies laying their eggs in pre-existing wounds.
  None of which is quite as terrifying as the claim that any one of us could end up with an eye worm simply by being exposed to too much dust — which helps explain why the true facts of the case aren't circulating with the photos. In folklore, the story's the thing. Accuracy takes a back seat to the emotional impact of the narrative; or, as folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand succinctly puts it, 'The truth never stands in the way of a good story.'

"Will a Copper Penny Cure a Bee Sting?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/bee_sting.htm","Copper Pennies and Bee Stings","2007-04-10 23:27:31","  By David Emery
  Viral message claims that taping a copper penny over a bee sting (or hornet sting) will provide overnight relief from redness and swelling. A penny for your bite!
  Description: Folk remedy Circulating since: Aug. 2006 Status: No scientific basis
  Example: Email contributed by Tilbury, August 14, 2006:
  Just wanted to share a bit of information for school.
  A couple of weeks ago I was unfortunate enough to get stung by both a bee and hornet while working in the garden. My arm swelled up so off to the doctor I went. The clinic gave me cream and an antihistimine. The next day the swelling was getting progressively worse so off to my regular doctor I went. Infected arm - needed an antibiotic. What was interesting is what Dr. Mike told me. The next time you get stung put a penny on the bite for 15 minutes. I thought, wow next time (if there ever is one) I will try it.
  Well that night Suzy's niece got stung by two bees. When she came over to swim I looked at the bite and it had already started to swell. So off I went to get my money. Taped a penny to her arm for 15 minutes. The next morning, there was no sign of a bite. Wow were we surprised. Her niece we decided just wasn't allergic to the sting.
  Well guess what happened again on Saturday night. I was helping Suzy dead head her flowers and guess what, you are right I got bit again two times by a hornet on my left hand. Was I ticked. I thought here I go again having to go to the doctor for yet another antibotic. Well I promptly went into the house, again got my money out and taped two pennies to my bites and then sat and sulked for 15 minutes. The penny took the string out of the bite immediately. I still wasn't sure what was going to happen. In the meantime the hornets were attacking Suzy and she got bit on the thumb. Again the penny. The next morning I would only see the spot where he had got me. No redness, no swelling. Went over the see Suzy and hers was the same. Couldn't even tell where she got bit. Then Suzy got stung again on Monday night on her back cutting the grass. This penny thing is going to make us money at school. Again it worked.
  Just wanted to share the marvelous information in case any of you are experiencing the same problem at home. We need to have a stock of pennies on hand at school.
  Dr. Mike said somehow the copper in the penny counteracts the bite. I would never had believed it. But it definitely does work.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: Does putting a penny on a bee sting or insect bite really provide relief from pain, or is that just an old wives' tale? Unfortunately, there's no scientific proof either way. The use of coins as a topical remedy for insect bites and stings has never been clinically tested.
  Is it possible that the copper content of a penny could somehow 'counteract' the effects of a bee sting? Maybe, though it seems unlikely. There are medical studies touting the successful use of skin creams containing 'copper peptide complexes' — mixtures of copper and amino acids — to accelerate the healing of wounds, but these carefully formulated ointments are a far cry from the random grimy penny dug out from the bottom of someone's coin purse. And unless it was minted before 1982, the typical U.S. penny in circulation today consists of a mere 2.5 percent copper. The rest is zinc.
  Copper pennies, bee stings, and folk medicine
  We do find copper coins mentioned as a curative in traditional folk medicine sources, though it is rarely in the context of insect bites or stings. In western countries the medicinal use of copper has generally been confined to the treatment of rheumatism ('Place a penny in the shoe or wear a copper bracelet around the wrist to relieve chronic pain') and warts ('Rub a copper penny over a wart 20 times and it will disappear'). The practice of rubbing copper coins on the skin, called 'coining,' is even more common in Asian folk medicine, which holds it to be helpful in treating fever, coughs, colds, and other mundane complaints.
  For bee stings in particular, topical home remedies of every conceivable kind have been tried and sworn by, including raw garlic, onion juice, chewing tobacco, wet tea bags, dill pickles, and even store-bought meat tenderizer. The latter supposedly works because it contains an enzyme called papain which breaks down the toxins in insect venom.
  Ironically, bee stings themselves — the very affliction we seek to cure — are believed to have curative powers by practitioners of Chinese folk medicine, who for 3,000 years have prescribed bee venom to relieve arthritis, back pain, and even liver disease. Bee sting therapy has also become popular of late in the United States as an alternative treatment for multiple sclerosis. According to proponents, bee venom contains melittin, an anti-inflammatory substance believed to be 100 times more potent than hydrocortisone. Please note, however, that no major clinical studies have yet been published to verify the treatment's effectiveness. Moreover, some people are allergic to bee stings and risk a severe reaction, even death.

"Did a Woman Really Lick Cockroach Eggs off an Envelope?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/cockroaches/a/fear_of_licking.htm","Fear of Licking","2005-03-17 19:09:01","  In the world according to urban folklore, horrors await us at every turn, lurking even in the most ordinary places. We are warned to beware of pay-phone coin slots booby-trapped with infectious needles, chicken sandwiches pocked with pus-filled tumors and toilet seats infested with venomous spiders.
  Is nothing safe anymore? Consider how dangerous it can be just to lick an envelope.
  In 1999, rumor had it that a number of people fell down dead after moistening the glue on ATM deposit envelopes with their tongues.
  Why? Because, supposedly, someone had adulterated the glue with cyanide, a fatal poison. The moral of the story was clear: envelope licking can be hazardous to your health. Don't do it.
  Not enough people paid heed, apparently, as evidenced by the following report sent to me by a reader in January 2000:
  Huh. Not to impugn the integrity of our correspondent's co-worker's spouse, but... baloney! The entire scenario smacked of urban legend — so much so that I demanded to know where the alleged incident took place. Virginia, I was told.
  Picture my skeptical reaction when, just a few days later, I began receiving copies of a forwarded email claiming that precisely the same thing had just happened to a postal worker in California:
  A true story? I think not. The separate accounts you have just read, the first set in Virginia and the second set clear across the country in California, arrived in my inbox five days apart (and more have arrived since). They are variants of the same urban legend . Any way you tell it, the urban legend is false.
  Consider this. A pregnant cockroach carries her eggs in a hard capsule called an ootheca, in which they incubate, intact, until the larvae (or 'nymphs') hatch, bursting the capsule open from the inside. The eggs themselves are tiny and delicate, and couldn't survive at all outside the ootheca, let alone flourish within the body of a mammalian host. It would be highly improbable, is what I'm saying, to find viable cockroach eggs strewn about on random surfaces — least of all on the folded flap of an envelope.
  Consider, too, the logical inconsistencies in the story. How is it that when the victim visited her doctor the first time, reporting a paper cut and showing visible signs of 'abnormal swelling,' he found 'nothing wrong'? And what was the point, during the second doctor visit, of X-raying the poor woman's tongue?
  The 'lump' allegedly detected by the x-ray was already in plain sight.
  Infestation legends derive from and play on people's horror of insects. The subtype in which 'creepy crawlers' invade the human body provoke an especially visceral response and are particularly popular for that reason. 'Roach Eggs on Envelopes' is very similar to the 1998-vintage ' Roach Eggs in Tacos ' legend, wherein cockroach larvae ingested in a fast food restaurant purportedly incubated in the lining of the victim's mouth.
  In a general way, both stories resemble 'The Spider Bite ,' an older legend about a traveler in a foreign country who discovers a seemingly innocuous insect bite on her body after an outing:
  It's not as if wayward insects never, ever find their way into crevices of the human body — they sometimes do, to the horror not only of the victim but of anyone who happens to hear the tale.
  But the bulk of infestation legends are just that: legends. They are concocted out of the teeniest, tiniest grains of truth, a generous sprinkling of latent dread, and a heaping helping of imagination. It's hard to resist sharing them with the ones you love.
  Reuters ran a news story a few years back about a British woman who complained to her doctor of a headache and 'strange noises in her ear.' On examining her, the doctor found a large spider lodged next to her eardrum.
  'The doctor removed the spider with a syringe,' the article continued, 'but also raised an unsavory possibility — that the arachnid was a female intent on laying eggs.'
  No spider eggs were found during the examination, however. So, why raise the 'unsavory possibility' at all?
  'Tis obvious: to make a good story that much better.

He is pleased (and in no small measure relieved) to report that no ill effects were noted during or after consumption of the shockingly inexpensive meal.
  Dear Urban Legends:
  There is a very strange rumor going around the Youngstown, Ohio area about Taco Bell being infested with cockroaches. Here's the story as I heard it:
  One of my friend's cousin's friends (of course you've got the dog in there somewhere, too) went to a local Taco Bell and ate what, I don't know. But supposedly the next day her gums swelled up and she called her dentist. He asked her where she ate and she told him. He told her to come in as soon as possible. She got there and there were cockroach eggs in her gums. He then contacted the local police department and they went to the Taco Bell and found live and dead cockroaches in the meat.
  Now let me tell you that:
  It seems like a hoax to me. I'm thinking that the people around here are so bored with their lives they have to do something to liven them up. My question to you is, is this the only time you've heard of this, or is it going around other areas too?
  Dear Reader:
  Thank you for asking. As a matter of fact, I hadn't heard this story until you passed it along just now, but a bit of Googling reveals that similar reports have been popping up all over the United States since the beginning of 1998.
  The two earliest variants I found, set in Boone, North Carolina, were recorded in the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup in March of that year:
  Example #1:
  Example #2:
  Three months later in June, another version was reported by someone in San Jose, California. The informant supplied a wealth of appetizing details, the specific menu items consumed by the victim and the exact location of the restaurant.
  Example #3:
  And then there was the following variant reported on October 20, no location specified. Note that in this case the victim's gums are said to have been bleeding, not her throat. Note, too, that the victim was the daughter of a friend of a coworker of the informant.
  Example #4
  By mid-November 1998, our burgeoning urban legend had received the full dramatic treatment in an anonymous email forwarded to and from Internet users all across the United States. Apart from the implication that the alleged incident took place in San Francisco, the outline of the story remained the same.
  Which brings us to the question, how credible is this story?
  The answer, giving due consideration to the known facts about cockroach reproduction and human physiology, as well as practical questions concerning the method by which these infestations allegedly took place, is that it is scarcely credible at all.
  Its validity presupposes the likelihood that:
  1. One or more pregnant roaches landed in a batch of chicken meat and remained there undetected by food service workers;
  2. The roach — or, at minimum, her egg capsule (called an ' ootheca ') — survived the standard 140-degree (F.) heat of the steam table;
  3.
  The roach's crunchy body was not seen, tasted or otherwise detected by the customer who allegedly ate it;
  4. The egg capsule wasn't swallowed intact, but instead ruptured during mastication, spilling out its contents in the customer's mouth;
  5. The eggs 'somehow got into her saliva glands' as opposed to being swallowed by the victim and digested;
  6. The eggs survived exposure to digestive enzymes in the victim's saliva;
  7. The victim was one of those fewer than one-in-four people who are allergic to cockroaches.
  8. Precisely the same thing happened more than once, to Taco Bell customers in various locations around the U.S.
  In the mold of fast food horror legends of yore
  Granted, any one, or two, or, for the sake of argument, even three of the above could conceivably have occurred, but all of them at once?
  In more than once instance? Believe it if you will, but in so doing prepare to admit you are taking a rather large leap of faith.
  The more supportable conclusion is that 1998 saw the birth of a new urban legend following the form of earlier food contamination tales, most notably ' The Kentucky-Fried Rat ,' in which a 'funny-tasting piece of chicken' from a KFC restaurant is discovered to be a deep-fried rodent.
  Such legends play, of course, on the reputed uncleanliness and low quality standards of fast food restaurants everywhere.
  Which reminds me. Have you heard the one about the guy who was eating a chicken sandwich at a certain fast food restaurant in Santa Fe and bit into a pus-filled abscess ?
  Or maybe it was in Toronto. Anyway, true story!

"Is There a Nasty Secret Ingredient in Your Energy Drink?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/fl/Do-Energy-Drinks-Contain-Bull-Semen.htm","Is There Bull Sperm in Your Energy Drink?","2014-04-08 18:02:18","  By David Emery
  According to online rumors, Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar and other brand-name energy drinks contain a secret ingredient to pep you up: bull semen. As it happens, there is an ingredient in most energy drinks called taurine . But is it really made using an extract from bull testicles?
  As shared on Facebook, April 1, 2014:
  Did You Know Your Energy Drinks Contain BULL URINE & SEMEN
  Energy Drinks Contain Ingredient Extracted From Bull Urine And Semen. A study done by Longhorn Cattle Company, tested some of the top energy drink brands such as Red Bull, monster etc. What they found might leave your stomach in a knot. They found that the drinks do, in fact, contain bull semen.
  Despite longstanding rumors to the effect that top-selling energy drinks such as Red Bull , Rockstar , and Monster contain unlisted ingredients such as bull sperm, bull urine and/or testosterone extracted from bull testicles, there is no truth to any of these claims.

  Where did people get this notion? It was apparently inspired by the fact that all of these beverages do contain taurine , which name was derived from taurus , which is Latin for bull .
  Scientists chose that name because, even though taurine occurs naturally in all fish and animal tissues (including human tissues), the first time they managed to isolate the amino acid it was from a specimen of ox bile. Ox bile isn't bull semen, it's produced by the gall bladder. But it's still an unpleasant-sounding substance. If that's still worrisome to anyone, rest easy.
  The taurine used in Red Bull and other energy drinks is completely synthetic. It's not made from animal tissues of any kind. It is an ingredient suitable for vegans.
  Why do they put taurine in energy drinks? To make good on the name 'energy drink.' Some studies have suggested that taurine may improve athletic performance and can even, combined with caffeine (another ingredient found in these products), improve mental acuity. Please note the use of the words 'may' and 'can' in the previous sentence. Further research needs to be done to confirm that taurine provides these specific health benefits.
  According to the Mayo Clinic, up to 3,000 mg. of supplemental taurine per day is considered safe for human consumption. Energy drinks typically contain around 1,000 mg. per serving (one 8.4-ounce can, in the case of Red Bull).
  Some doctors warn that energy drinks should be consumed in moderation , but that's mainly due to their high caffeine content, not because there's any danger of a bull semen overdose.

  Forwarded emails and text messages warn mobile phone users not to accept calls from certain numbers which allegedly transmit a high-frequency signal causing brain hemorrhage and death. Similar rumors have circulated since 2007 and have been repeatedly debunked by authorities.

  It's not a joke rather, its TRUE. 27 persons died just on receiving calls from these numbers. Watch Aaj Tak (NEWS), DD News and IBN 7.
  Forward this message to all u'r friends and colleagues, and relatives
  Analysis: (Updated) Don't panic, it's a hoax. Variants of the so-called 'red number,' 'cursed phone number,' or 'death call' hoax first appeared on April 13, 2007 ( Friday the 13th ) in Pakistan, where they caused widespread panic and inspired a slew of ancillary rumors, including the claim that the phone calls, if listened to, could also trigger impotence in men and pregnancy in women. According to news reports, Pakistanis were heard trading secondhand stories of actual deaths that had supposedly occurred, with some claiming the fatalities were the handiwork of ancestral spirits enraged by the construction of a cell phone tower over a graveyard.
  In an effort to quell the hysteria, government officials and mobile phone providers issued statements disproving the rumors, but, just as they began to subside in Pakistan, similar messages commenced spreading throughout Asia, the Middle East, and finally Africa. MTN Areeba, the largest cellular network in Ghana, released a statement echoing the assurances previously made by other providers: 'A full scale national and international priority investigation has been conducted in the last 48 hours,' a spokesperson said. 'The investigation has confirmed that these rumours are completely unsubstantiated and have no technological evidence to support them.'
  According to engineers, cell phones are incapable of emitting sound frequencies that could cause immediate physical injury or death.
  Earlier (2004) variant suggests rumor may have originated in Africa
  In July 2004 a much simpler version of this rumor caused a minor outbreak of panic in Nigeria. An example of the forwarded text message published on South Africa's Independent Online news website read as follows:
  'This is an absolute hoax and should be treated as such,' said a representative of Nigeria's largest cellular provider at the time, VMobile, in a statement to the press.
  Nokia version immediately followed
  A bogus ' confidential letter ' apparently inspired by the Nigerian rumor began circulating around the same time, purporting to have been written by a Nokia executive who claimed that 'use of our mobile phones can cause spontaneous death to the user in certain circumstances.'
  'The problem manifests itself when the phone is dialled from certain numbers,' continued the letter, replete with misspellings and poor English grammar. 'The mobile base sends out massive quantities of electromagnetic energy, whic resonates from the mobile phone's antenna. As the user answers his phone, the energy surges into his body, resulting in both coronary heart failure and brain haemorraging, generally followed by severe external bleeding and rapid death.'
  Nokia quickly disavowed the letter, dismissing it as a 'work of fiction.'

"Are Raw Egg Whites a Legitimate Burn Remedy?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/Egg-Whites-For-Burns.htm","Egg Whites as a Burn Remedy? No","2011-07-27 23:41:31","  By David Emery
  A viral message recommends covering burned skin with raw egg whites as a 'miracle healing' home remedy. Is there any scientific basis for it? What do medical professionals say?
  In this case, the email should be immediately trashed, perhaps with a warning to the person spreading it. Egg whites are not an appropriate treatment for burns, according to medical authorities. Following the advice in the email could result in more injury or delay appropriate treatment.
  Viral text contributed by a reader, July 20, 2011
  Fwd: BURNS
  Good to know!!
  A young man sprinkling his lawn and bushes with pesticides wanted to check the contents of the barrel to see how much pesticide remained in it. He raised the cover and lit his lighter; the vapors inflamed and engulfed him. He jumped from his truck, screaming. His neighbor came out of her house with a dozen eggs, yelling: 'bring me some eggs!' She broke them, separating the whites from the yolks. The neighbor woman helped her to apply the whites on the young man's face. When the ambulance arrived and when the EMTs saw the young man, they asked who had done this. Everyone pointed to the lady in charge. They congratulated her and said: 'You have saved his face.' By the end of the summer, the young man brought the lady a bouquet of roses to thank her. His face was like a baby's skin.
  Healing Miracle for burns:
  Keep in mind this treatment of burns which is included in teaching beginner fireman this method. First aid consists to spraying cold water on the affected area until the heat is reduced and stops burning the layers of skin. Then, spread egg whites on the affected area.
  One woman burned a large part of her hand with boiling water. In spite of the pain, she ran cold faucet water on her hand, separated 2 egg white from the yolks, beat them slightly and dipped her hand in the solution. The whites then dried and formed a protective layer.
  She later learned that the egg white is a natural collagen and continued during at least one hour to apply layer upon layer of beaten egg white. By afternoon she no longer felt any pain and the next day there was hardly a trace of the burn. 10 days later, no trace was left at all and her skin had regained its normal color. The burned area was totally regenerated thanks to the collagen in the egg whites, a placenta full of vitamins.
  This information could be helpful to everyone: Please pass it on

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  As in the case of a similar email recommending a coating of plain white flour to relieve and heal minor burns, the above text advising the use of raw egg whites for the same purpose runs contrary to accepted medical practice.
  Conventional wisdom did once hold that minor burns were best treated by slathering traumatized skin with various oils, salves, and poultices — and even ready-to-hand household items like raw egg whites or flour if no other dressings were available — but this is no longer the case, and hasn't been for quite some time.
  Current medical sources, including the Mayo Clinic and the American Red Cross , recommend treating a minor (first- or second-degree) burn by immersing it in cool water, then covering it loosely with dry, sterile gauze.
  Those would be the measures taught to firefighters-in-training — not, as claimed above, applying raw egg whites to a burn victim's skin.
  A 2010 article in the Journal of Emergency Nursing explicitly recommends against treating burns with raw egg whites. The study, entitled 'First-Aid Home Treatment of Burns Among Children and Some Implications at Milas, Turkey,' compares the outcomes of pediatric burn cases in which about half of the subjects had been treated with 'inappropriate remedies' such as tomato paste, yogurt, and raw egg whites.
  'No data supporting any benefit of applying or placing such types of agents on burned areas has been found,' the author noted. Moreover, he wrote, '[t]he risk of infection from applying most of these inappropriate remedies to a fresh burn wound is obvious. For example, eggs can serve as an excellent culture medium for micro-organisms.' And, in one particular case cited in a related study, a 13-month-old child with a second-degree burn went into anaphylactic shock after his parents treated it by rubbing a raw egg on his skin. It turned out he was allergic to eggs.
  'Many of these burn injuries and incorrectly applied first-aid burn treatments can be avoided,' the 2010 article concludes. 'Educational programs that emphasize applying only cold water to burn injuries would be helpful in reducing burn-related morbidity.'
  As would a reduction in the circulation of forwarded emails touting unscientific 'miracle cures.'

"Read About South Korea's Bizarre Fear of 'Fan Death'","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/fan_death.htm","The Scourge of Fan Death","2008-08-26 19:55:22","  By David Emery
  If you've ever fallen asleep in a closed room with an electric fan running, you're lucky to be alive.
  That's what many folks in South Korea believe, at any rate, including some government health authorities. The Korean Consumer Safety Board's 2005 Summer Safety Guide listed 'asphyxiation from electric fans and air conditioners' as one of the top five summer hazards, with 20 cases reported between 2003 and 2005.
  'Doors should be left open when sleeping with the electric fan or air conditioner turned on,' the bulletin recommends. 'If bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long, it causes bodies to lose water and hypothermia. If directly in contact with a fan, this could lead to death from increase of carbon dioxide saturation concentration and decrease of oxygen concentration.'
  For this reason, most electric fans sold in South Korea are equipped with an automatic shut-off timer, and some even carry a warning: 'This product may cause suffocation or hypothermia.'
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  I know what you're thinking: there couldn't possibly be any scientific basis for this. And you're right. It's a bona fide Korean urban legend, reinforced by 35 years of media coverage of alleged fan-related fatalities. Even many doctors believe in 'fan death,' apparently, though some, citing a dearth of published research, refuse to grant it credence.
  'There is little scientific evidence to support that a fan alone can kill you if you are using it in a sealed room,' Dr. John Linton of Severance Hospital in Seoul told JoongAng Daily in 2004. 'Although it is a common belief among Koreans, there are other explainable reasons for why these deaths are happening.' Like other skeptical health professionals, Linton suspects most of the deaths are attributable to pre-existing health conditions that go unreported in media coverage.
  'People believe in fan death because -- one -- they see a dead body and -- two -- a fan running,' Seoul National University Hospital professor Yoo Tai-woo said in a 2007 interview with Reuters. 'But normal, healthy people do not die because they slept with a fan running.'
  JoongAng Daily also contacted a Canadian expert on hypothermia, Gord Giesbrecht, who said he'd never heard of such a thing as fan death. 'It's hard to imagine, because to die of hypothermia, [one's body temperature] would have to get down to 28, drop by 10 degrees overnight,' he said. 'We've got people lying in snowbanks overnight here in Winnipeg and they survive.'
  Some fan death believers say hypothermia isn't the real culprit anyway. One theory holds that the fan creates a 'vacuum' around the face, suffocating the victim. Another holds that running a fan or air conditioner in a closed room causes a build-up of carbon dioxide, also suffocating the victim. Both of these explanations smack of pseudoscience.
  It should be stated that South Korea isn't the only country with health-related urban legends. Ask most Americans, for example, and they will earnestly tell you that if you swallow chewing gum it will stay in your stomach for seven years (if not for the rest of your life), and that sitting too close to a television set will ruin your eyesight. Neither of these is true, but on the other hand no one believes doing these things will kill you, either.
  Though recent news coverage reveals a slight upsurge in public skepticism about fan death, the belief still seems to be widely entrenched in Korean culture. Severance Hospital's John Linton has called for a medical task force to conduct autopsies in fatalities attributed to electric fans to determine the true causes of death. This seems like the best approach -- indeed, the only approach to take -- if the scourge of 'fan death' is to be eradicated in South Korea once and for all.

"Did a Study Say Fellatio Decreases Risk of Breast Cancer in Women?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/Fellatio-Breast-Cancer.htm","Did a Study Say Fellatio Decreases the Risk of Breast Cancer in Women?","2010-12-02 16:44:30","  By David Emery
  Homemade web page masquerading as an AP news story published on CNN.com claims that women can decrease their risk of breast cancer by, quote, 'performing the act of fellatio on a regular basis.' Uh-huh. Some less-than-careful mainstream media outlets (they know who they are) bought this hoax hook, line, and sinker. Did you?
  Description: Web hoax / Joke Circulating since: Oct. 2003 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: As posted in an Internet forum, Oct. 9, 2003:
  Study: Fellatio may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer in women
  Thursday, October 2, 2003
  (AP) -- Women who perform the act of fellatio on a regular basis, one to two times a week, may reduce their risk of breast cancer by up to 40 percent, a North Carolina State University study found.
  Doctors had never suspected a link between the act of fellatio and breast cancer, but new research being performed at North Carolina State University is starting to suggest that there could be an important link between the two.
  In a study of over 15,000 women suspected of having performed regular fellatio over the past ten years, the researchers found that those actually having performed the act regularly, one to two times a week, had a lower occurance of breast cancer than those who had not. There was no increased risk, however, for those who did not regularly perform.
  'I think it removes the last shade of doubt that fellatio is actually a healthy act,' said Dr. B.J. Sooner of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. 'I am surprised by these findings, but am also excited that the researchers may have discovered a relatively easy way to lower the occurance of breast cancer in women.'
  The University researchers stressed that, though breast cancer is relatively uncommon, any steps taken to reduce the risk would be a wise decision.
  'Only with regular performance will your chances be reduced, so I encourage all women out there to make fellatio an important part of their daily routine,' said Dr. Inserta Shafteer, one of the researchers at the University. 'Since the emergence of the research, I try to fellate at least once every other night to reduce my chances.'
  The study is reported in Friday's Journal of Medical Research.
  In 1991, 43,582 women died of breast cancer, as reported by the National Cancer Institute.
  Dr. Len Lictepeen, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said women should not overlook or 'play down' these findings.
  'This will hopefully change women's practice and patterns, resulting in a severe drop in the future number of cases,' Lictepeen said.
  Sooner said the research shows no increase in the risk of breast cancer in those who are, for whatever reason, not able to fellate regularly.
  'There's definitely fertile ground for more research. Many have stepped forward to volunteer for related research now in the planning stages,' he said.
  Almost every woman is, at some point, going to perform the act of fellatio, but it is the frequency at which this event occurs that makes the difference, say researchers.
  The reasearch consisted of two groups, 6,246 women ages 25 to 45 who had performed fellatio on a regular basis over the past five to ten years, and 9,728 women who had not. The group of women who had performed fellatio had a breast cancer rate of 1.9 percent and the group who had not had a breast cancer rate of 10.4 percent.
  'The findings do suggest that there are other causes for breast cancer besides the absence of regular fellatio,' Shafteer said. 'It's a cause, not THE cause.'

  Highest Paid Male Actors Ever
  Analysis: Is it really necessary to debunk this story? The names alone suffice to show it's a spoof: Dr. B.J. Sooner . Dr. Inserta Shafteer . Dr. Len Lictepeen .
  This was not published by the Associated Press. Or CNN.com.
  In point of fact, this faux report first appeared on a college student's website in October 2003. It vanished without explanation soon afterward, only to reappear 24 hours later with a disclaimer stating that the story — which now bore a byline: 'Brandon Williamson' — was intended for 'entertainment purposes only.' (A revised version was stripped of all graphics and references to CNN, presumably due to threats of litigation.)
  Those who find this sort of prank amusing will probably also enjoy ' Ogling Breasts Increases Men's Lifespans ,' a similar spoof circulating since 2000.

"Creepy, Scary Babysitting Experience","http://paranormal.about.com/od/hauntedplaces/a/tales_11_04_10t.htm","Creepy Babysitting Experience","2011-04-05 22:12:31","  My scary experience happened to me when I was babysitting my cousin's six children in the neighboring reservation called Little Saskatchewan. It was June, 2007. It was already 10:00 p.m.; I know because the kids were supposed to be in bed at 9:30, so I got them all ready for bed, and off they went. I sat around for a while, made a snack, and went to the computer room to waste some time, since I wasn't tired yet.
  I decided to call a friend, since I was feeling uneasy about being up alone in Kathy's house (the nearest neighbor was quite a way across a field) and it was so quiet after the kids were asleep. I was talking on the phone to my friend. It made me forget about the uneasy feeling I had earlier. I decided to go outside for a cigarette.
  I sat on the back door steps, still on the phone. I told my friend to wait until I was done, because I wasn't too scared when I talking on the phone.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  I finished my cigarette and let my friend go. I wanted to do some things around the house. As I was walking inside, I noticed the front door across the living room was wide open. No one ever uses the front door. It was even taped shut -- summer in the country, in Manitoba, is the worst for mosquitoes.
  I walked fast to go close it. I even put a small table in front of it so it wouldn't open again. I checked the kids quickly; they were all sound asleep. Feeling very creeped out, I proceeded to go to the computer room to get my mind off what happened. As I was sitting there, I heard a knock at the window. There were blinds on it, so I couldn't see out. I got up and walked to the living room, pretending I didn't hear it.
  Suddenly, I heard knocking at the front window, then the kitchen window, then all the windows at the same time. It got louder and louder. I flipped! I know this part is really cliché but, I grabbed a knife and the phone and ran and sat with my back against the back door, where there were no windows. Then I heard a scratch that started at the top of the door all the way to the bottom.
  As it got to the back of my head, I started to cry. I quickly called my friend back and told him everything. His only advice was to tell me to call someone to pick me up, which was not a possibility, since I didn't know anyone in Lil Sask (as we call it) and that there were six kids sleeping in the bedroom. I calmed down enough to get off the phone, and made a bed in the living room with the lights on and I fell asleep.
  In the morning, I took a walk outside to look around. There was no evidence of any being here, no footprints, nothing. I didn't tell Kathy what happened. I just wanted to go home and get away from there. I told my mom a few days later; she then told Kathy, of course. Kathy admitted that before when her sister was sleeping over on the couch, that she awoke to a little girl -- with no face! -- standing in front of her. After that, no amount of money would make me babysit for Kathy overnight again.

"About the US Environmental Protection Agency the EPA","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/technologyandresearch/a/aboutepa.htm","The US Environmental Protection Agency","2007-05-20 23:18:03","  Just as the U.S. needs the military to protect its interests in the world, so too it needs an agency to police its natural resources at home. Since 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has fulfilled that role, setting and enforcing standards to safeguard the land, air, ​and water as well as protect human health.
  Founded as a federal agency in 1970 following a proposal by President Richard Nixon , the EPA was an outgrowth of the growing public alarm over environmental pollution over the course of a century and a half of immense population and industrial growth. The EPA was established not only to reverse years of neglect and abuse of the environment, but also to ensure that government, industry and the public take better care to protect and respect the fragile balance of nature for future generations.
  Headquartered in Washington, D.C. , the EPA employs more than 18,000 people across the country, including scientists, engineers, lawyers and policy analysts.
  It has 10 regional offices - in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle -- and a dozen laboratories, all headed by an administrator who is appointed by and answers directly to the President of the United States .
  The EPA's primary responsibilities are to develop and enforce environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act , which must be obeyed by federal, state and local governments, as well as by private industry. The EPA helps to formulate environmental laws for passage by Congress and it has the power to issue sanctions and levy fines. Among the EPA's accomplishments are a ban on use of the pesticide DDT; supervising the cleanup of Three Mile Island , site of the nation's worst nuclear power plant mishap; mandating the phased elimination of chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone-depleting chemical found in aerosols; and administering the Superfund , which finances the cleanup of contaminated sites throughout the nation.
  The EPA also assists state governments with their own environmental concerns by providing research grants and graduate fellowships; it supports public education projects to get people directly involved in protecting the environment on a personal and public level; it offers financing assistance to local governments and to small businesses to bring their facilities and practices into compliance with environmental regulations; and offers financial assistance for large-scale improvement projects like the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund , the goal of which is to provide cleaner drinking water.
  Most recently, the EPA has been assigned to lead the federal government’s effort to address climate change and global warming by reducing carbon pollution and emissions of other greenhouse gasses from U.S. transportation and energy sectors. To help all Americans address these issues, the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program focuses on improving energy efficiency in homes, buildings, and appliances. In addition, the EPA formulates vehicle fuel efficiency and pollution emissions standards. By partnering with states, tribes, and other federal agencies, the EPA works to enhance the ability of local communities to deal with climate change through its Sustainable Communities initiative .
  The EPA also publishes a great deal of information for public and industrial education about protecting the environment and limiting the impact of people and their activities.

"Does Flour Really Work as a Burn Remedy?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/Flour-For-Burns-Home-Remedy.htm","Flour as a Burn Remedy","2011-04-01 19:50:45","  By David Emery
  Flour for burns? This viral message claims covering burned skin with plain white flour will immediately stop any pain and promote healing without so much as a blister. Medical professionals such as those at the Mayo Clinic advise relying on proven remedies instead.
  Email text. 2011
  FW: Burn Remedy
  My experience with burns is this:
  Once I was cooking some corn and stuck my fork in the boiling water to see if the corn was ready. I missed and my hand went into the boiling water....
  A friend of mine, who was a Vietnam vet, came into the house, just as I was screaming, and asked me if I had some plain old flour...I pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it. He said to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes which I did. He said that in Vietnam, this guy was on fire and in their panic, they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out...well, it not only put the flour out, but he never even had a blister!!!!
  SOOOO, long story short, I put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 minutes, pulled it out and had not even a red mark or a blister and absolutely NO PAIN. Now, I keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time I burn myself, I use the flour and never ONCE have I ever had a red spot, a burn nor a blister! *cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour.
  Miracle, if you ask me. Keep a bag of white flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did. I even burnt my tongue and put the flour on it for about 10 minutes. and the pain was gone and no burn. Try it! BTW, don't run your burn area under cold water first, just put it right into the flour for 10 minutes and experience a miracle!

  Once upon a time — a century-and-a-half ago, to be exact (see references below) — dredging a minor burn with ordinary wheat flour was considered an acceptable medical treatment, even by some physicians. But so were dressing the wound with white lead paint, greasy poultices, and turpentine-soaked cotton. All these treatments were eventually discredited and abandoned as medical knowledge progressed.
  Up-do-date medical sources such as the Mayo Clinic and the American Red Cross advise treating a minor (first- or second-degree) burn by immersing it in cool water, then covering it loosely with dry, sterile gauze. Scientific studies have proven these measures effective.
  The purpose of running cool water over the burn is to draw heat away from the skin, reducing swelling and pain. The purpose of a sterile bandage is to minimize air flow over the wound (which can exacerbate pain) and to protect the skin should blistering occur. It stands to reason that covering burned skin with refrigerated flour might produce some of the same benefits, but it could also cause complications (if your skin begins to blister, do you really want it coated with nonsterile flour?). Why take risks with an outmoded remedy?
  There's no scientific reason to suppose (and certainly no peer-reviewed studies to prove) that plunging your scalded limb into a bag of cold flour will lead to a better prognosis than immersing it in cool water and applying a proper bandage.
  Beware of all medical advice that arrives via forwarded email or viral Facebook post.
  For historic reference, here are quotes from medical sources. Keep in mind that at this time the standard treatment for many diseases was bloodletting. Pasteur, Koch, and Lister were just developing knowledge of germs and using ​antiseptic technique. Women died of sepsis soon after childbirth because doctors did not believe in handwashing. Antibiotics wouldn't be developed until the middle of the next century.

  Those aren't my words. They represent the considered opinion of the medical professionals at Mayo Clinic, who further recommend: 'The best approach to hangovers is to avoid them by not overimbibing in the first place.'
  Rest, plenty of water, and over-the-counter pain medications are the nearest thing you'll find to a hangover 'cure,' doctors say. Even so, homespun remedies abound, some of them dating back hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
  Premised on the quaint notion that the best thing for what ails you is more of what ails you, ' hair-of-the-dog-that-bit-you ' nostrums have been popular since Shakespeare's time (before that, etymologists tell us, the phrase referred quite literally to a method of treating dog bites).

  The Bloody Mary , invented during the Roaring Twenties, is still touted as the ideal morning-after pick-me-up. Another evil-sounding but reputedly effective concoction popularly believed to relieve the more painful symptoms of a hangover is called Black Velvet and consists of equal parts champagne and flat Guinness. Hemingway, it is said, relied on a morning-after tonic of tomato juice and beer.
  I have a friend of Mexican descent who swears by menudo (boiled tripe) first thing in the morning. Fatty, high-calorie foods like menudo have long figured among the most popular homespun hangover cures. The ancient Romans ate deep-fried canaries , supposedly. The Greeks, we're told, sought relief by devouring sheep's lungs. Among the ancients generally, dining on boiled cabbage before a drinking binge was widely thought to be the best preventative. One prescription from the Medieval period touts the combination of eel and bitter almonds.

"Is a Dog's Mouth Cleaner Than a Human's?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/dog_breath.htm","Is a Dog's Mouth Really Cleaner Than a Human's?","2005-06-25 19:00:28","  By David Emery
  Believe it or not, the idea that a dog's mouth is sterile actually has its roots in medical literature. It has long been noted by physicians that human bites are more likely to become infected than those of other mammals, including dogs. Once statistics to that effect were published in journals and began to be repeated by medical professionals, folk wisdom took off from there.
  Bite Wounds vs. Closed-Fist Injuries
  Lately, however, the accuracy of those statistics has come under attack, with critics objecting that some of the human 'bites' compared to animal bites in earlier studies weren't really bites at all. A 1988 review published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine found the following:

  And a 1995 review in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology concurred:
  Although the issue remains scientifically controversial, the revisionists have a very good point. Until recently, the statistics on human bite wounds didn't differentiate between what we would ordinarily consider a bite and so-called closed-fist injuries — the type of hand wound suffered by a human being who slugs another human being in the mouth.
  By their very nature, such wounds are deeper and more serious than bites passively sustained, and thus more likely to result in complications. Their inclusion in general bite-wound statistics, some researchers now argue, skewed past pathological comparisons of human bites with animal bites .

  Viral alert warns that evildoers are exposing innocent victims to the AIDS virus by attaching HIV-contaminated needles to gas pump handles.
  Description: Internet hoax Circulating since: June 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by R. Anderson, June 13, 2000:
  Please read and forward to anyone you know who drives.
  My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.
  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months.
  We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.
  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.
  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.
  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.

  HIV/AIDS Needles hidden under gas pumps
  In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIC positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
  Analysis: Not to worry. On June 20, 2000, mere days after the overwrought warning above first slammed inboxes across the Internet, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department issued a press release declaring it a hoax.
  'The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has had no reports of such incidents and there is no 'Capt. Abraham Sands' at the JSO,' the statement said. Nor had any such incidents been reported elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, according to the CDC, there are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted via needle-sticks in non-health care settings, ever (see statement below).
  The viral warning was, and is, entirely fictitious.
  It did add an interesting new wrinkle to the HIV needle-stick rumors already circulating online in various forms since 1997. Previous variants warned of tainted syringes planted in movie theater seats and pay phone coin slots , not to mention random 'stealth prickings' (for lack of a better phrase) in night clubs and other crowded public places. Now we have tainted needles on the handles of gas pumps to contend with. Where will they turn up next?
  Copycat pranks
  All these variants have been investigated and deemed false by authorities with the sole exception of a spate of apparent copycat pranks that occurred around the beginning of 1999 in western Virginia. According to police there, actual hypodermic needles were found in the coin slots of public phones and bank night deposit slots in a couple of small towns in the area. None were found to be contaminated with HIV or any other biological agent. Presumably the pranksters were imitating rumors that had already been circulating online for months.
  Groundless though it may be, the conviction that unknown assailants are intentionally spreading AIDS by hiding contaminated needles in public places remains popular, especially on the email forwarding circuit. One reason is that these tales and other urban legends like them provide an outlet for unspoken fears — of strangers, of the motives of some of the more marginal members of society, of AIDS itself. They're cautionary tales , albeit ones that don't really function as such — not literally, at any rate — in that they fail to address the primary way HIV is actually transmitted: unsafe sex.
  'Pump' at your own risk
  Which raises an interesting point. By virtue of the fact that each of these fictitious scenarios depicts the transmission of HIV via acts of penetration, each works as a metaphor for sex. Consider the claim that one risks exposure to HIV simply by inserting one's finger into the coin slot of a public phone. The imagery isn't pretty, but it's apt.
  Now we're being warned to be careful when pumping gas , to take all due precautions before sliding the nozzle into the tank.
  Sound advice? Metaphorically speaking, yes!
  Statement from the CDC on needle-stick rumors and AIDS:
  Have people been infected with HIV from being stuck by needles in non-health care settings?
  No. While it is possible to get infected with HIV if you are stuck with a needle that is contaminated with HIV, there are no documented cases of transmission outside of a health-care setting.
  CDC has received inquiries about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC 'confirmed' the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to be rumors/myths.

"Hand Sanitizer Hazardous to Children","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/hand_sanitizer.htm","English Fingerplay Songs for Kids","2016-09-26 01:42:55","  By Kenneth Beare
  Fingerplays - Learning Through Movement Here are a number of English fingerplay songs which combine movements of the hands and fingers with key vocabulary . The act of singing and acting out on the fingers children make both a kinetic and musical connection to the new words, also known as a multiple intelligences approach to learning. Fingerplays are usually chanted, although some songs also have movements which are in parentheses after each spoken line.
  'Three Little Monkeys' can have as many verses as you like to practice the numbers . Here are the last two verses as examples.
  Verse 1
  Three little monkeys jumping on the bed, (tap three fingers on palm)
  One fell off and bumped is head. (one finger falls off, then hold head)
  Mama called the doctor and the doctor said: (hold imaginary telephone to your ear)
  'No more little monkeys jumping on the bed.' (shake finger)
  Verse 2
  Two little monkeys jumping on the bed, (tap three fingers on palm)
  One fell off and bumped is head. (one finger falls off, then hold head)
  Mama called the doctor and the doctor said: (hold imaginary telephone to your ear)
  'No more little monkeys jumping on the bed.' (shake finger)
  Verse 1
  Little bunny Foo-Foo hopping through the forest (raise your hand up and down as if hopping along through the forest)
  Scooping up the chipmunks and bopping them on the head. (pound fist into palm)
  Down came the good fairy and she said: (drop shaking hand from above to below)
  Little bunny Foo-Foo, I don't want to see you (shake finger)
  Scooping up the chipmunks and bopping them on the head (raise your hand up and down as if hopping along through the forest)
  I'll give you three chances, (raise three fingers)
  And if you're not good, I'll turn you into a goon. (raise both hands up into the sky and shake them as if frightened)
  Verse 2
  So, the very next day... (repeat except the fairy Godmother says 'two chances')
  Verse 3
  So, the very next day... (repeat except the fairy Godmother says 'one chance')
  Final Moral
  The moral of this story is: Hare today, Goon Tomorrow! (play on words of the common saying: 'Here today, gone tomorrow')
  1
  Clap, clap, clap your hands as slowly as you can. (clap your hands slowly)
  Clap, clap, clap your hands as quickly as you can. (clap your hands quickly)
  2
  Shake, shake, shake your hands as slowly as you can. (shake your hands slowly)
  Shake, shake, shake your hands as quickly as you can. (shake your hands quickly)
  3
  Rub, rub, rub your hands as slowly as you can. (rub your hands slowly)
  Rub, rub, rub your hands as quickly as you can. (rub your hands quickly)
  4
  Roll, roll, roll your hands as slowly as you can. (roll your hands slowly)

"HIV Needles in Movie Theater Seats","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/needle_stick.htm","HIV+ Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles?","2007-08-01 15:55:48","  By David Emery
  Viral alert warns that evildoers are exposing innocent victims to the AIDS virus by attaching HIV-contaminated needles to gas pump handles.
  Description: Internet hoax Circulating since: June 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by R. Anderson, June 13, 2000:
  Please read and forward to anyone you know who drives.
  My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.
  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months.
  We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.
  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.
  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.
  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.
  ********* PLEASE HELP US BY MAINTAINING A VIGILANCE AND BY FORWARDING THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES. THE MORE PEOPLE WHO KNOW OF THIS THE BETTER PROTECTED WE CAN ALL BE. **********

  2013 version via social media: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 26, 2013:
  HIV/AIDS Needles hidden under gas pumps
  In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIC positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
  Analysis: Not to worry. On June 20, 2000, mere days after the overwrought warning above first slammed inboxes across the Internet, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department issued a press release declaring it a hoax.
  'The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has had no reports of such incidents and there is no 'Capt. Abraham Sands' at the JSO,' the statement said. Nor had any such incidents been reported elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, according to the CDC, there are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted via needle-sticks in non-health care settings, ever (see statement below).
  The viral warning was, and is, entirely fictitious.
  It did add an interesting new wrinkle to the HIV needle-stick rumors already circulating online in various forms since 1997. Previous variants warned of tainted syringes planted in movie theater seats and pay phone coin slots , not to mention random 'stealth prickings' (for lack of a better phrase) in night clubs and other crowded public places. Now we have tainted needles on the handles of gas pumps to contend with. Where will they turn up next?
  Copycat pranks
  All these variants have been investigated and deemed false by authorities with the sole exception of a spate of apparent copycat pranks that occurred around the beginning of 1999 in western Virginia. According to police there, actual hypodermic needles were found in the coin slots of public phones and bank night deposit slots in a couple of small towns in the area. None were found to be contaminated with HIV or any other biological agent. Presumably the pranksters were imitating rumors that had already been circulating online for months.
  Groundless though it may be, the conviction that unknown assailants are intentionally spreading AIDS by hiding contaminated needles in public places remains popular, especially on the email forwarding circuit. One reason is that these tales and other urban legends like them provide an outlet for unspoken fears — of strangers, of the motives of some of the more marginal members of society, of AIDS itself. They're cautionary tales , albeit ones that don't really function as such — not literally, at any rate — in that they fail to address the primary way HIV is actually transmitted: unsafe sex.
  'Pump' at your own risk
  Which raises an interesting point. By virtue of the fact that each of these fictitious scenarios depicts the transmission of HIV via acts of penetration, each works as a metaphor for sex. Consider the claim that one risks exposure to HIV simply by inserting one's finger into the coin slot of a public phone. The imagery isn't pretty, but it's apt.
  Now we're being warned to be careful when pumping gas , to take all due precautions before sliding the nozzle into the tank.
  Sound advice? Metaphorically speaking, yes!
  Statement from the CDC on needle-stick rumors and AIDS:
  Have people been infected with HIV from being stuck by needles in non-health care settings?
  No. While it is possible to get infected with HIV if you are stuck with a needle that is contaminated with HIV, there are no documented cases of transmission outside of a health-care setting.
  CDC has received inquiries about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC 'confirmed' the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to be rumors/myths.

  These are all hoaxes — or, to be more precise, they're all versions of the same hoax. Following the advice of unsourced viral alerts like these is an ineffective, if not outright counter-productive, way of maintaining computer or network security. Protecting oneself from real virus and Trojan threats requires a few simple though critically important measures.

"HIV Needles in Pay Phone Coin Slots","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa110498.htm","Dirty Needles, Pay Phones and You","2016-02-07 14:44:07","  November 4, 1998
  THE LATEST email scare story is already spawning new variations as recipients spice it up with their own personal touches before forwarding it on to others.
  Here are three versions in current circulation: Example #1:
  Subject: This is serious!
  Subject: VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!
  ALERT! ALERT! FYI.. Don't use that telephone
  There is something new happening that everyone should be aware of.
  Drug users are now taking their used needles and putting them into the coin return slots in public telephones. People are putting their fingers in to recover coins or just to check if anyone left change. They are getting stuck by these needles and infected with hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. This message is posted to make everyone aware of this danger. Be aware! The change isn't worth it!
  P.S. - This information came straight from phone company workers, through the EMT instructor. This did NOT come from a hearsay urban legend source.
  Example #2:
  A weird story crossed my desk and thought I'd pass it along.
  A friend-of-a-friend is currently going through EMT class and they've been warned (told) to be very careful reaching into any slot for return change. I guess the latest 'thing' is placing used hypodermic needles into change-return slots, causing people to get pricked when they reach in for their change. These needles are showing up primarily at public pay phones, but obviously it could spread easily and quickly (e.g. stamp machines, vending machines, etc).
  Please be careful. Thanks for your attention.
  Example #3:
  According to a Singaporean Tan Kim Leng, recently many people were reported sick (diseases like Hepatitis B, Aids, etc.) after being poked by a needle, what happened is this. Some cruel, sickening people would place an infected needle or pin inside the little compartment of the public telephone where you get the return change, (the opening with a flipping metal door where you put your fingers in to get back your remaining coins after you used the public phone) and this is how you get in touch with the needle and you get infected. Many cases had been reported, I mean many severe cases. Quite a number of the employee of Singapore Telecom (those who went round to collect the coins in the public phones were infected too). As far as we know, it has not been announced publicly, but very soon they would. Just be more careful if you really need to use the public phones, you may use, but insert the exact amount, otherwise, just forego those changes, I'm sure your life worth much more than these. Remember to spread this piece of information to as many people as possible, especially to your children and the elderly at home or those who do not have a cellular phone.
  By the way, Tan Kim Leng is heading the Jurong Branch Police Station in Singapore, if you watch the Singapore news tonight, you probably would have seen him on TV.
  This is a true incident that happened in Jarkata & Singapore discovered by a doctor. Sooner or later it will spread over the region including Hong Kong & Taiwan as well. So, please be alert with public phones and beware of aids !!
  Analysis: It's scary, sounds authoritative, and is replicating in every part the world at this very moment. Is it an urban legend? Yes.
  Moreover, the fact that more than one version is circulating demonstrates that anonymous senders are altering the text at will. As is the case with most such email alerts, the information they contain is inherently unreliable.
  Ah, but is it true ?
  No. As of this writing, no actual cases have been documented. (Note: see update on apparent copycat incidents in Virginia.)
  Which is not to say that an incident of the kind described may not have happened somewhere, sometime. Odds are it has occurred at least once, though I've been unable to locate a single news report anywhere to substantiate that.
  What renders the rumor incredible as a whole is the implication that the placing of used needles in coin return slots is a common occurrence and that everyone, everywhere is endangered by it.
  Are we to believe that a worldwide junkie convention took place wherein it was decided that public phones are the new needle disposal receptacle of choice? Was a resolution passed that instead of throwing away entire syringes (which won't fit into a coin return slot), all needles must henceforth be purposely detached and secreted somewhere where they can harm others?
  Not likely.
  Furthermore, what's the motive? Are we to think that drug addicts are a malicious and hateful lot by nature? There's no good reason to suppose it. Sure, they're notoriously irresponsible; sure, they're often found to be involved in criminal activities beyond using illegal drugs; but it doesn't follow that we should expect them to commit random acts of evil.
  Though absurd in its specifics, the rumor echoes on a deeper level the conviction most of us have that the world is not as safe and sane a place as it used to be. It supplies anecdotal 'evidence' to support a growing trend toward fear and distrust of strangers, particularly those who live on the seemier margins of society. Although the rumor was unfounded when it first erupted, reports of copycat incidents (Feb. 1999) now lend it an unfortunate after-the-fact credibility and nourish that underlying sense of insecurity. The dividing line between paranoia and prudent caution becomes harder and harder to discern.

"Inflammatory Breast Cancer","http://womensissues.about.com/od/womensbodiesminds/a/ElectiveMastect.htm","'I Chose a Prophylactic Double Mastectomy...and I Didn't Have Breast Cancer'","2008-10-28 16:10:14","  She knows some will say that her prophylactic double mastectomy was a radical choice and that she might never have developed breast cancer.
  But she wasn't willing to live with the threat hanging over her head.
  Sophie has told very few friends and relatives about what she's done, partly because her privacy is important to her and partly because she knows reactions may vary. In a culture where many women choose lumpectomy instead of mastectomy to keep their breasts intact, she understands how painful and difficult a decision like this can be.
  In her own words, Sophie explains why she chose a double mastectomy and how it's changed her life.
  My sister and I both grew up under the “breast cancer” cloud. Our mother was diagnosed at age 34 and died at 41. The knowledge that breast cancer could be hereditary was with me 24/7.
  I know other women growing up with a family history of breast cancer feel the same way. You know what your legacy is, but because you're in your twenties you still feel immune. However, every form you fill out, every interview you have in the examining room, your family history looms large. Nobody wants to take any chances with you.
  It wasn't until my 30th birthday - when I had my baseline mammogram and my chart had the stamp of “family history”- that the fear began.
  The grief of my mother's loss, and the knowledge that it was due to breast cancer had always been present in my life. But once I turned 30 and became a mother, the fear kicked in. I had so much more to lose now. I didn't want to leave my children motherless as I had been.
  Each year I had annual mammograms and extra exams by a surgeon.
  Extra precautions were taken including many biopsies that turned up nothing but frayed nerves. The mammograms were especially unnerving. 'Seek and you shall find,' I thought...and worried. Each year as I sat in my gown waiting to be told I could get dressed and no more “views” were needed, I thought, 'This could be it—the year it happens to me.'
  When I was 36 I decided to take the test for the breast cancer gene: BRCA 1 & 2. It was a simple blood test. I paid around $1,000 out of pocket. I made a deal with myself. If the genetic test came back negative I would let myself off the hook. I would continue to be vigilant about early detection but I wouldn’t identify so much with every woman’s sad breast cancer story. I would try to remind myself that I wasn’t doomed and breast cancer wasn’t coming to get me as it had my mother. We didn’t know if my mother carried the gene but if I tested negative I would assume (or pretend) that I was in the general female population and maybe a diagnosis of breast cancer was not my fate.
  The test came back negative. I cried with relief. I knew from my research that hereditary breast cancers were actually the minority of cases but l I was still relieved in a big way that I didn’t carry the breast cancer gene.
  The black cloud dissipated for a few years. But then it came back with a vengeance.
  My sister was diagnosed with pre-menopausal breast cancer at age 48. It was a nightmare but on some level we knew it was coming.
  That’s just how it feels when you live under the cloud.
  My sister had a double mastectomy, chemo, radiation, hair loss—the works.
  'Okay,' I thought. 'Time to make another deal with myself.' I asked my sister to undergo genetic testing. I reasoned that if she tested positive for the breast cancer gene I could let myself off the hook big time since I tested negative. I could assume it was hereditary and I escaped.
  If she tested negative I would assume it does run in our family and they just haven’t identified the genetic code for this kind of aggressive familial breast cancer. In that case I would have a prophylactic double mastectomy.
  She tested negative.
  I knew I was next.
  And finally, that was what led me to this decision.
  For years, I'd thought about having a prophylactic double mastectomy and wondered what compelling thing would have to happen in my life for me to do it. If any biopsy came back positive...when I heard of new people being diagnosed...I thought about what I'd do.
  Since a close family member was an oncologist, I knew about every different circumstance and all the possibilities and options out there.
  When I heard what other people had done and how they took different approaches, I remember thinking, 'If that had been me, that breast would have come off.'
  So when my sister was diagnosed - and the genetic testing showed we were both negative for the breast cancer gene -I opted to have my breasts removed.
  I’ve heard people, including some doctors, say that having two healthy breasts removed in the name of prevention is a radical step. Not for me.
  I realize there might have been a possibility that I'd never develop breast cancer.
  But it's not about statistics - it's about how you feel inside. It gets to the point that you just don't want this hanging over your head anymore.
  I was married, had my children and was ready to say good-bye to my two anxiety provoking appendages.
  To be perfectly honest, I was more afraid of the enormity of the mastectomy and reconstruction process than sad over losing my breasts. I’ve always been a baby about medical procedures and this whole thing seemed too bad to be true.
  I had to find a general surgeon to remove the breasts and then find a plastic surgeon to work side-by-side with him to start the reconstruction process.
  If you opt to have reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy you need to have “expanders” placed behind the chest muscle and have saline injected into the “expanders” every few weeks until you have reached your desired breast size.
  Then you have another surgery where the permanent implants replace the expanders.
  So I did all that, but I kept it a secret from nearly everyone except a few close friends. It was a personal decision that I didn’t want to discuss for several reasons, the main one being personal privacy.
  Breasts are a private part that we keep hidden from the public. I had a large chest growing up and when I was younger, guys stared at it and I was never flattered - I felt uncomfortable. Once I had the double mastectomy, I didn't want to be the object of curiosity. I didn't want to invite more people to stare at my reconstructed chest.
  There are a couple of positives that the implants offer. Because I was large chested, the shoulder straps of my bras always dug into my shoulders. If I wanted any support, I had to wear uncomfortable underwire bras that I would always take off the minute I got home. With implants, you don't need to wear a bra, thus no more uncomfortable straps. Another benefit is that your breasts are now firm and perky. No more 'National Geographic Hanging Breast' syndrome - I finally had more than a few inches between my belly button and the bottom of my breasts. It makes you look younger and thinner.
  Still, it's not worth the trade. The first year, every time I went to roll on my side in bed at night, I woke up from the pain. There was the healing process, and there was soreness.
  I discovered there isn’t any real support for women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy. The support goes to the women who are having the surgery because of a cancer diagnosis, and rightly so. They have a lot more challenges ahead of them than I did.
  My plastic surgeon’s office offered very little information of any kind. I had to call them the day before the surgery to ask what I should bring to wear home from the hospital.
  I had no idea what to expect. The only information came from a 5 minute video I saw in the office that detailed the surgical procedure. The film was geared toward breast cancer patients.
  They didn't give me any guidance or support, or explain all the things I should be doing to make healing easier. Technically, my surgeon did a good job but I had no idea of what to expect afterwards.
  Keeping it a secret makes it more difficult to get first-hand information and advice. If you join a breast cancer support group you have any number of people to help you with the process. While you're in the hospital, a survivor visits you and provides support. But if you're not a survivor and you keep it a secret, you miss out on that support.
  Because I didn’t share my situation I did not have a ‘community’ of people helping me. I traded emotional support and casseroles for privacy.
  My plastic surgeon was technically proficient but a real jerk. He inserted implants that were not the size I asked for. They were huge and too big for my frame. I had to wait three months and have the implant surgery redone by someone else.
  During that time I googled answers to my many questions, relying on a few excellent plastic surgery websites that offered detailed information.
  At the time I did this, all the plastic surgery-based TV reality shows were big hits. You could see surgeons reshaping imperfections. I couldn't help but compare those TV results to my misshapen results -an end product that even doctors themselves admit falls short of what reconstructive breast surgery should be able to achieve.
  Although these shows provided a glimpse of what goes on, every woman who's undergone reconstructive surgery at the time of her mastectomy knows it's a lengthy and challenging medical procedure. And afterwards, I couldn't complain to my doctors about the outcome. The surgeon who inserted the too-large implants was very dismissive when I asked about the cosmetic results, saying to me, 'Be thankful that you don't have cancer.'
  However, the relief in not having any breasts far outweighed anything else.
  My children were too young to understand what was going on, so I simply said I was going to be in the hospital for a few days. I explained, 'Because Mommy's sister just had breast cancer and Mommy doesn't want to get it, they have invented a special operation where they scoop out the insides of Mommy's breast and give me a new inside so I won't get cancer.' They just accepted what I said and we didn't talk about it all that much.
  I know what I went through as a young woman with a family history, so I would hate to pass on to a daughter the continuing worry of breast cancer. There's a feeling of doom that you internalize. I've had friends whose mothers also faced breast cancer and beat it. Our lives are so different. Their story isn't one that has a sad, sad ending. For a girl watching her mother die, it has a unique and profound effect on her and her life forever. For them, it's not on the front burner as it was for me.
  I read an article recently where a woman had a prophylactic double mastectomy and the doctor himself tried to talk her out of it, telling her it was a drastic measure and she really didn't need to do it. The woman said, 'They don't know what it's like walking around knowing that they may soon get breast cancer.' The removal of your breasts takes away that risk.
  If I were brave, I would have ridden it out. I wasn't brave - I was aggressive. My level of worry was escalating every year and I just couldn't live with the tension. Yet I can see how other people wouldn't make the choice that I made.
  If I were brave, I wouldn't have to eliminate the unknown fear. But I was scared and tired of being vigilant. The relief that I experience from not having the threat and worry of breast cancer hanging over my head far outweighs any hardship I experienced medically and emotionally.
  Today, I think nothing of these implants and I don't think of myself harboring a big secret.
  I don't worry about anyone's opinion of what I did. It isn't a matter of right or wrong. I saw it with such clarity - it was the best thing for me to do. And with all of it behind me, and the overwhelming fear no longer present in my life, I truly have no regrets.

  Forwarded email claims the humble lemon is a 'miraculous product' that kills cancer cells and has been proven '10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy.'

  Lemon - kills Cancer Cells
  A must-read - The surprising benefits of lemon! I remain perplexed!
  Institute of Health Sciences 819 N. L.L.C. Charles Street Baltimore, MD 1201.
  This is the latest in medicine, effective for cancer!
  Read carefully & you be the judge.
  Lemon (Citrus) is a miraculous product to kill cancer cells. It is 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy.
  Why do we not know about that? Because there are laboratories interested in making a synthetic version that will bring them huge profits. You can now help a friend in need by letting him/her know that lemon juice is beneficial in preventing the disease. Its taste is pleasant and it does not produce the horrific effects of chemotherapy. How many people will die while this closely guarded secret is kept, so as not to jeopardize the beneficial multimillionaires large corporations? As you know, the lemon tree is known for its varieties of lemons and limes. You can eat the fruit in different ways: you can eat the pulp, juice press, prepare drinks, sorbets, pastries, etc... It is credited with many virtues, but the most interesting is the effect it produces on cysts and tumors. This plant is a proven remedy against cancers of all types. Some say it is very useful in all variants of cancer. It is considered also as an anti microbial spectrum against bacterial infections and fungi, effective against internal parasites and worms, it regulates blood pressure which is too high and an antidepressant, combats stress and nervous disorders.
  The source of this information is fascinating: it comes from one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world, says that after more than 20 laboratory tests since 1970, the extracts revealed that: It destroys the malignant cells in 12 cancers, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreas ... The compounds of this tree showed 10,000 times better than the product Adriamycin, a drug normally used chemotherapeutic in the world, slowing the growth of cancer cells. And what is even more astonishing: this type of therapy with lemon extract only destroys malignant cancer cells and it does not affect healthy cells.

  Analysis: While it's true that recent scientific studies have shown that lemons and other citrus fruits contain compounds which may have anti-carcinogenic properties, I've found nothing in the medical literature to support the wildly exaggerated claims above — the claim that lemons are 'a proven remedy against cancers of all types,' for example, or the claim that lemons are '10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy.'
  Nor have I found evidence to support the statement that these claims originated from 'one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world.'
  A representative of the Institute of Health Sciences told me the organization did not publish the text, was not the source of the claims, and indeed, as an allied health school, isn't in the business of providing medical information to the general public.
  What the actual research says
  Several substances occurring naturally in citrus fruits have been found to have cancer-fighting potential in scientific studies, of which the two most promising appear to be limonoids and pectin.
  Limonoids , a class of natural compounds found mainly in the skin and seeds of citrus fruits, are being studied as both a preventative and a treatment for cancer. For example, research has shown that particular limonoids can inhibit the spread of breast cancer cells in vitro . Further research is needed to determine their clinical effectiveness in human beings.
  Modified citrus pectin , derived from the natural pectin found in the pulp and peel of citrus fruits, has been shown in animal and in vitro studies to reduce the metastasization of cancer cells. Again, further research is needed to prove their clinical effectiveness in humans.
  It goes without saying that lemons and other citrus fruits are nutritious and health-promoting in myriad ways, so while the jury may still be out on exactly how and to what extent they're effective in preventing and treating cancer, they should certainly be regarded as an essential component of a healthy diet.

"Leftover Onions Are Poisonous","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/leftover_onions_are_poisonous.htm","Are Leftover Onions 'Poisonous,' as Claimed on the Internet?","2010-02-04 20:21:07","  By David Emery
  A viral text circulating since April 2008 claims that raw, leftover onions are 'poisonous' and should never be kept for re-use, even in a refrigerator, because they are 'a huge magnet for bacteria,' supposedly, and especially prone to spoilage. Food scientists do not concur.
  Description: Viral message Circulating since: April 2008 Status: Mostly false See also: Do Onions Absorb Flu Germs?
  Example: Email text contributed by Mikki D., November 24, 2009:
  FW: LEFT OVER ONIONS ARE POISONOUS!!!
  I have used an onion which has been left in the fridge, and sometimes I don't use a whole one at one time, so save the other half for later.
  Now with this info, I have changed my mind.... will buy smaller onions in the future.
  I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products, Makers of mayonnaise.. Mullins is huge, and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family. My friend, Jeanne, is the CEO.
  Questions about food poisoning came up, and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.
  The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula. He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.
  Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz. During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise. People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil. Ed's answer will surprise you. Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe.
  'It doesn't even have to be refrigerated. No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary.' He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment. He then talked about the quaint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.
  Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?). Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors. It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES.
  He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions. You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion.. He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.
  It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)
  Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble. Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.
  So, how's that for news? Take it for what you will. I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on. For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Analysis: Versions of this text have been circulating since mid-2008, with the earliest examples attributed to food writer 'Zola Gorgon' (aka Sarah McCann). I have not been able to locate the exact date or venue of its original appearance.
  While the article makes a valid point about the relative safety of commercially-produced mayonnaise versus the other ingredients typically found in homemade potato salad (e.g. onions and potatoes), it exaggerates the danger of keeping and using leftover raw onions.
  According to science writer Joe Schwarcz , onions are in no sense a 'magnet for bacteria.' In fact, Schwarcz writes, cut onions contain enzymes that produce sulphuric acid, which inhibits the growth of germs. Onions can become contaminated during handling, but there's nothing about them that makes them intrinsically more susceptible to bacterial growth or spoilage than any other raw vegetable.
  'So unless you have sliced your onions on a contaminated cutting board, or handled them with dirty hands,' Schwarcz explains, 'you can safely put them in a plastic bag and store them and there will not be any bacterial contamination.'
  The notion that onions are a 'bacteria magnet' may stem from an old wives' tale dating at least as far back as the 1500s, when it was believed that distributing raw onions around a residence guarded against the bubonic plague and other diseases by 'absorbing the elements of infection.'
  Though it has no scientific basis whatsoever, some people still believe this today .

  Description: Viral text Circulating since: 2007 Status: Unsubstantiated
  Summary: Viral message circulating via email and social media claims spraying an outside area with Listerine mouthwash repels and/or kills every mosquito in the vicinity.
  Example: Email contributed by J.F., October 9, 2007:
  Subject: mosquito killer
  The best way of getting rid of mosquitoes is Listerine, the original medicinal type. The Dollar Store-type works, too. I was at a deck party awhile back, and the bugs were having a ball biting everyone. A man at the party sprayed the lawn and deck floor with Listerine, and the little demons disappeared. The next year I filled a 4-ounce spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever I saw mosquitoes. And voila! That worked as well. It worked at a picnic where we sprayed the area around the food table, the children's swing area, and the standing water nearby. During the summer, I don't leave home without it.....Pass it on.
  A USERS COMMENTS:
  I tried this on my deck and around all of my doors. It works - in fact, it killed them instantly. I bought my bottle from Target and it cost me $1.89. It really doesn't take much, and it is a big bottle, too; so it is not as expensive to use as the can of spray you buy that doesn't last 30 minutes. So, try this, please. It will last a couple of days. Don't spray directly on a wood door (like your front door), but spray around the frame. Spray around the window frames, and even inside the dog house if you have one.

  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  Analysis: There are no scientific studies to confirm or disprove these anecdotal claims, though laboratory tests have shown that standard chemical-based mosquito repellents are generally more effective and longer-lasting than botanical-based alternatives, of which Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash would have to be counted as one.
  The primary active ingredient in Listerine is eucalyptol, a derivative of eucalyptus oil, which in turn is commonly used in botanical insect repellents. According to various clinical studies it actually does repel mosquitoes. However, the eucalyptus-based compounds tested in these studies contained much higher concentrations of the essential oil than that found in Listerine Antiseptic — 40 percent to 75 percent concentrations as opposed to Listerine's .092 percent — and were applied topically, not sprayed in the air or on surrounding objects. Given Listerine's extremely low eucalyptol content, it's doubtful the product would function very effectively as a repellent — not for long, at any rate — even if applied directly to the skin.
  The claim that Listerine sprayed around door and window frames actually kills mosquitoes is even more dubious. Listerine consists mostly of water and alcohol, which means it evaporates quickly whenever and wherever it is sprayed. I have no doubt that drenching mosquitoes with the stuff would kill a significant number of them, but there's little reason to suppose that spraying it on hard surfaces would have any lingering mosquito-killing effect.

  Analysis: It's true that an early draft of what came to be known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ('Obamacare') would have established a national medical device registry to track the safety and efficacy of all kinds of medical devices including, but not limited to, 'implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining' ones (such as heart pacemakers, stents, neurostimulators, ophthalmic devices, drug delivery systems, and biometric monitors).
  It did not mandate the use of any such devices, however.
  Let me repeat: It did not mandate the use of any such devices.
  Nowhere in any version of the health care bill did it say Americans must have microchips or any other devices implanted anywhere in their bodies. The only thing the proposed registry was designed to 'track' was the efficacy and safety of medical devices.
  In any case, the provision that would have created the national medical device registry was entirely stricken from the final legislation signed into law by President Obama.
  Miscronstrued and misrepresented
  The language in bills such as this is dense, technical, and sometimes hard to decipher. It is easy to misconstrue, and therefore easy to misrepresent. For example, one Internet posting quotes part of the stricken passage about a national medical device registry and claims it stipulates that 'all Americans may be compelled to receive a micro-chip, similar to that used in the identification and control of animals, in order to receive State mandated health care.'
  Read the passage carefully . It says no such thing.
  The enacted version of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains no mention of implantable medical devices at all, much less implantable RFID chips, much less a provision requiring all U.S. citizens to have them.

"Lead in Lipstick","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/fl/Gold-Ring-Test-for-Lead-in-Lipstick.htm","Gold Ring Test for Lead in Lipstick","2016-08-20 23:31:32","  By David Emery
  A viral alert circulating since May 2003 claims major-brand lipsticks contain cancer-causing lead, which consumers can test for by scratching the surface of a product with a 24K gold ring.
  Analysis: There's no such thing as a 'gold ring test' for lead in cosmetics. The handy home test for lead in lipstick touted in the message is bogus. Certain metals, including gold, may leave a dark streak when scratched across various surfaces, but this is reportedly an artifact of the metals themselves, not an indicator of a chemical reaction with lead or any other specific substance. No scientific explanation or proof has ever been offered to support the claim that contact with gold reveals the presence of lead in lipsticks.
  Moreover, while tests by the FDA and consumer groups confirm the presence of trace amounts of lead in name-brand lipsticks, the government maintains that the products are safe for human use.
  This much-forwarded message is long on misinformation and short on facts. It's true that laboratory tests have shown that many name-brand lipsticks sold in the United States contain trace amounts of lead from the dyes used in manufacturing. According to statements from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Cancer Society, however, the lead content of these coloring agents meets all current safety standards set by U.S. government agencies, and poses no serious health threat to consumers .
  Moreover, the message is both inaccurate and misleading when it implies that cancer is the primary health hazard posed by lead exposure. Though lead is indeed listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen, it has other, more direct health effects — including brain damage, nerve disorders and reproductive problems — that are far more worrisome .
  For accurate information on known and suspected health hazards associated with cosmetic products and ingredients, including lipstick, see the cosmetics section of the FDA website (plus updates below).
  Rumor: In May 2003, an email began making the rounds claiming that many of the most popular lipsticks on the market contain lead and will cause cancer. The email then offers a way to test lipsticks to see if they have lead.
  Fact: A search of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website finds that lead content of coloring agents used in lipstick is regulated by that agency, and that the levels permitted are not a health problem.
  A new version of this message circulating since September 2006 contains the additional claim that the material was authored by a Dr. Nahid Neman of the breast cancer unit of Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto. No such person exists.
  New test results published by a consumer advocacy group, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics , confirmed the outcome of previous tests showing that some name-brand lipsticks sold in the United States do, in fact, contain trace amounts of lead. One-third of the 33 products tested contained an amount of lead in excess of 0.1 ppm (parts per million), the group said, which is the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's upper limit for allowable lead in candy. The FDA has not set an overall limit for lead in cosmetics, though it does regulate how much lead is permitted in coloring agents used in their manufacture. The consumer group is calling for reformulation of the lead-containing products and stricter oversight by the Food & Drug Administration. FDA spokesperson Stephanie Kwisnek responded in a statement to the Associated Press that the agency will examine the new test results and determine what action, 'if any,' may be needed to protect public health.
  Following up on test results published by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration conducted its own tests on the same brands of lipstick and concluded the following:
  FDA found lead in all of the lipsticks tested, ranging from 0.09 ppm to 3.06 ppm with an average value of 1.07 ppm. FDA concludes that the lead levels found are within the range that would be expected from lipsticks formulated with permitted color additives and other ingredients that had been prepared under good manufacturing practice conditions.
  Is there a safety concern about the lead found by FDA in lipsticks?
  No. FDA has assessed the potential for harm to consumers from use of lipstick containing lead at the levels found in its testing. Lipstick, as a product intended for topical use, is only ingested incidentally and in very small quantities. FDA does not consider the lead levels that it found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern.
  More laboratory tests commissioned by the FDA found traces of lead in at least 400 shades of name-brand lipstick. However, the federal agency continues to insist the levels aren't harmful. 'We do not consider the lead levels we found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern,' says the FDA website. 'The lead levels we found are within the limits recommended by other public health authorities for lead in cosmetics.' Consumer groups continue to challenge the FDA's position, arguing that even small amounts of lead are unacceptable.
  As posted on Facebook, April 8, 2013:
  An email contributed by Richard L. on Nov. 5, 2004:
  Subject: Dangers of Lead in Lipstick
  Even lipstick isn't safe anymore...what's next? Brands don't mean everything. Recently a brand called 'Red Earth' decreased their prices from $67 to $9.90. It contained lead. Lead is a chemical which cause cancer.
  The brands which contain lead are:
  I. CHRISTIAN DIOR 2. LANCOME 3. CLINIQUE 4. Y.S.L (Yves St. Laurent) 5. ESTEE LAUDER 6. SHISEIDO 7. RED EARTH (Lip Gloss) 8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner) 9. MARKET AMERICA-MOTNES LIPSTICK.
  The higher the lead content, the greater the chance of causing cancer.
  After doing a test on lipsticks, it was found that the Yves St. Laurent (YSL) lipstick contained the most amount of lead. Watch out for those lipsticks which are supposed to stay longer. If your lipstick stays longer, it is because of the higher content of lead.
  Here is the test you can do yourself:
  1. Put some lipstick on your hand. 2. Use a gold ring to scratch on the lipstick. 3. If the lipstick color changes to black then you know the lipstick contains lead. Please send this information to all your girlfriends, wives and female family members.
  This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Dioxin carcinogens causes cancer. Especially breast cancer

  A forwarded message circulating online warns consumers not to drink bottled water that has been sitting in a warm car for any length of time because, supposedly, the heat causes cancer-producing toxins to 'leak' from the plastic into the water. How accurate is it?
  Description: Email rumor / Viral text Circulating since: April 2007 Status: False as written / Scientific research is ongoing
  2013 example of the rumor As posted on Facebook, May 4, 2013:
  Plastic Bottled Water DIOXIN Danger
  LET EVERYONE WHO HAS A WIFE/GIRLFRIEND/ DAUGHTER KNOW PLEASE!
  Bottled water in your car is very dangerous! On the Ellen show, Sheryl Crow said that this is what caused her breast cancer. It has been identified as the most common cause of the high levels of dioxin in breast cancer tissue..
  Sheryl Crow’s oncologist told her: women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The heat reacts with the chemicals in the plastic of the bottle which releases dioxin into the water. Dioxin is a toxin increasingly found in breast cancer tissue. So please be careful and do not drink bottled water that has been left in a car.
  Pass this on to all the women in your life. This information is the kind we need to know that just might save us! Use a stainless steel canteen or a glass bottle instead of plastic!
  This information is also being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ... No plastic containers in microwaves. No plastic water bottles in freezers. No plastic wrap in microwaves.
  Dioxin chemical causes cancer, especially breast cancer. Dioxins are highly poisonous to cells in our bodies. Don’t freeze plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic. Recently the Wellness Program Manager at Castle Hospital, was on a TV program to explain this health hazard.
  He talked about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating food in the microwave using plastic containers..... This especially applies to foods that contain fat.
  He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastic releases dioxin into the food.
  Instead, he recommends using glass, such as Pyrex or ceramic containers for heating food... You get the same result, but without the dioxin.. So, such things as TV dinners, instant soups, etc., should be removed from their containers and heated in something else.
  Paper isn’t bad but you don’t know what is in the paper. It’s safer to use tempered glass, such as Pyrex, etc.
  He reminded us that a while ago some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the styrene foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons....
  Also, he pointed out that plastic wrap, such as Cling film, is just as dangerous when placed over foods to be cooked in the microwave.

  2007 example of the rumor Email text contributed by Jori M., April 22, 2007:
  ...a friend whose mother recently got diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor told her women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The doctor said that the heat and the plastic of the bottle have certain chemicals that can lead to breast cancer. So please be careful and do not drink that water bottle that has been left in a car and pass this on to all the women in your life.
  This information is the kind we need to know and be aware and just might save us!!!!
  *The heats causes toxins from the plastic to leak into the water and they have found these toxins in breast tissue. Use a stainless steel canteen or a glass bottle when you can*!
  Note: Newer variants of the above warning reiterate a previously circulated claim that microwaving food in plastic containers and/or plastic wrap releases dioxin into the food. Those allegations are discussed here .
  Analysis: False as written, though research into potential health hazards associated with disposable water bottles is ongoing (see updates at the bottom of this page).
  Plastic bottles of the type used for packaging commercially marketed drinking water in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as 'food contact substances' and held to the same safety standards as food additives. This means, among other things, that the FDA reviews test data on the safety of the plastics used in disposable water bottles — including the potential for hazardous chemicals to leaching or 'migrate' from the plastic into the water — and has thus far established that they pose no significant risk to human health. The water itself is also tested and required to meet basic quality standards similar to those set by the Environmental Protection Agency for public drinking water.
  Disposable vs. reusable
  It's important to note that the plastic used in the manufacture of pre-packaged, disposable water bottles is different from the plastics believed to pose a human health threat in other applications such as baby bottles, plastic children's toys, and reusable sports water bottles. Disposable water bottles do not contain bisphenol A (BPA) , for example, about which safety concerns have been raised.
  That's not to say that water sold in plastic bottles is one hundred percent free of all contaminants, or that chemical leaching from plastics to liquid never takes place. Studies done on water bottled in FDA-approved polyethylene terephthalate (PET) , for example, did find that trace amounts of potentially hazardous substances had apparently migrated from the plastic into the water. The important point to take away, however, is that those amounts were minuscule, and well within the human safety limits set by FDA and EPA regulators.
  Germs a greater concern?
  According to Dr. Rolf Halden of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, consumers face a much greater risk from potential exposure to microbial contaminants in bottled water — germs, to you and me — than from chemical ones. For that reason, most experts suggest not refilling or reusing empty bottles.
  It should also be noted that the plastics used in the manufacturer of reusable water bottles vary in composition and quality and may be more susceptible to chemical leaching than the disposable type.
  Regarding Sheryl Crow
  Some versions of this warning contain the additional claim that musician Sheryl Crow announced during a pre-2008 appearance on the Ellen Degeneres TV show that she got breast cancer as a result of drinking bottled water. While it's true that Crow has discussed her bout with cancer on Degeneres' show more than once and reportedly cautioned viewers against drinking water from heated plastic bottles during one of those appearances, I've found no evidence confirming that she explicitly blamed her own cancer on water bottles. Citing advice from her own nutritionist, Crow did issue a warning against drinking water from heated bottles in a Sep. 2006 statement on her website, but, again, did not claim it was the cause of her own illness.
  Update (2009): German study on chemical leaching
  A new European study raises concerns about the safety of disposable water bottles, which are currently regarded as safe by the FDA and other government health agencies. Researchers in Germany found evidence of a man-made estrogen-like compound leaching into water packaged in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. This type of substance, known as an 'endocrine disruptor,' has the potential to interfere with estrogen and other reproductive hormones in the human body. Please note that the authors of the study conclude by saying that more research is required to determine whether, and to what degree, this poses an actual health risk to human beings.

  Update (2014): China/Univ. of Florida study on chemical leaching
  A study on water stored in PET bottles for a relatively long period of time (four weeks) at temperatures up to 158 degrees Fahrenheit found that levels of the chemicals BPA and antimony, a carcinogen, gradually increased. Though only one brand of the 16 tested yielded amounts of these chemicals exceeding EPA safety standards, researchers said more testing is needed to ensure the safety of the products.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: Don't get your hopes up, guys. No such study was ever published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( check for yourself ).
  A search of the thousands of peer-reviewed articles contained in the National Institutes of Health medical journal database turns up zero items documenting the health benefits of staring at women's breasts, and, for that matter, zero items authored by 'Dr. Karen Weatherby' (who does not exist, so far as I can tell).
  If the story smacks of supermarket tabloid faux-journalism, well, that's precisely what it is. The text first hit the Internet in March or April 2000, mere weeks after a strikingly similar article appeared in the consistently misinformative Weekly World News (nor is this the first time we've encountered baseless Internet rumors traceable to precisely that source). A slightly different version had already appeared in the May 13, 1997 issue of the tabloid.
  A fresh round of breast-staring mania overtook the Internet in March 2011, when Fox News republished the story before checking the facts.
  It showed up again a few months later on the Scottish news site Daily Record & Sunday Mail : ' Doctors Say Looking at Busty Women for 10 Minutes a Day is Good for Your Health .'
  It goes without saying (I hope) that it's unwise to take medical advice from tabloid 'news' stories, still less from forwarded emails. Males who wish to increase their lifespans ought to consider practicing common sense as an alternative — it's more likely to achieve the desired result than any amount of public breast ogling.
  Admittedly, I don't have any medical research to back that up. Volunteers?

"Leptospirosis: Woman Catches Deadly Disease from Unwashed Coke Can","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_coke_can_leptospirose.htm","Can You Get Leptospirosis from Soft Drink Cans?","2016-08-20 02:44:49","  By David Emery
  A viral message circulating since September 2002 claims a person in North Texas (or Belgium, Botswana or elsewhere, depending on version) came down with a deadly disease called leptospirosis after drinking Coke from an unwashed can contaminated with dried rat urine.
  If you compare the two earliest variants below, one of which began circulating in 2002 and the other three years later in 2005, you will find they are identical except for the following features:
  1. The first claims the woman became sick in Belgium; the second in north Texas.
  2. The first refers to the disease as 'leptospirosis;' the second calls it 'leptospirose.'
  3. The first claims a study conducted in Spain showed that the tops of soda cans are 'more contaminated than public toilets;' the second says the study was done at 'NYCU' (perhaps meaning NYU, or New York University).
  Don't panic. Neither version is likely to be true. While rat urine certainly can and often does carry diseases that affect humans (if the rat itself is a carrier of the disease), rat urine is not inherently toxic or rife with 'deathly substances' as claimed.
  Soda cans are typically stored and shipped in shrink wrap or cardboard cases, so, while they can get dirty on store shelves, they're not necessarily the first place one should expect to encounter dried rat urine contamination.
  There's no record in medical journal databases of any study conducted at NYU, NYCU or anywhere else comparing the cleanliness of soda cans and that of public toilets.
  Though relatively rare, leptospirosis is a real and potentially life-threatening disease which can be transmitted via rat urine and feces (and those of other animals). However, all of the cases reported in Texas over the past several years affected the canine population only.
  The text of this rumor is may have been inspired by another rumor circulating since 1999 warning of fatal diseases transmitted via rat urine and/or droppings on soda cans.
  Shared on Facebook on June 28, 2012:
  On Sunday a family went to picnic with a few drinks in tin cans. On Monday, two family members were admitted to hospital and placed in the Intensive Care Unit. One died on Wednesday.
  Autopsy results concluded it was leptospirosis. Test results showed that tin was infected mice that had dried urine containing Leptospira.
  It's highly recommended to rinse the parts evenly on all soda cans before drinking it. Cans are usually stored in the warehouse and delivered direct to retail stores without cleaning. A study shows that the top of all beverage cans are more contaminated than public toilets.
  Clean it with water before putting your mouth on it in order to avoid all accidental contamination. Please forward this message to all your loved ones.

  IMPORTANT PLEASE READ
  This incident happened recently in North Texas. We need to be even more careful everywhere. A woman went boating one Sunday, taking with her some cans of coke which she put in the refrigerator of the boat. On Monday she was taken into the Intensive Care Unit and on Wednesday she died.
  The autopsy revealed a certain leptospirose caused by the can of coke from which she drank without using a glass. A test showed that the can was infected by dried rat urine, hence the disease Leptospirosis.
  Rat urine contains toxic and deadly substances. It is highly recommended to wash the upper part of soda cans thoroughly before drinking out of them as they have been stocked in warehouses and transported straight to the shops without being cleaned.
  A study at NYCU showed that the tops of soda cans are more contaminated than public toilets, full of germs and bacteria. Wash them with water before putting them to the mouth to avoid any kind of fatal accident.
  Please forward this message to all the people you care about.

  A viral article circulating since 2009 claims that placing raw, sliced onions around the home will protect the household from influenza and other diseases by 'collecting' or 'absorbing' any germs or viruses present. Science and common sense suggest otherwise.

  FW: ONIONS FOR COLLECTING THE FLU VIRUS
  In 1919 when the flu killed 40 million people there was this Doctor that visited the many farmers to see if he could help them combat the flu. Many of the farmers and their family had contracted it and many died.
  The doctor came upon this one farmer and to his surprise, everyone was very healthy. When the doctor asked what the farmer was doing that was different the wife replied that she had placed an unpeeled onion in a dish in the rooms of the home, (probably only two rooms back then). The doctor couldn't believe it and asked if he could have one of the onions and placed it under the microscope. She gave him one and when he did this, he did find the flu virus in the onion. It obviously absorbed the virus, therefore, keeping the family healthy.
  Now, I heard this story from my hairdresser in AZ. She said that several years ago many of her employees were coming down with the flu and so were many of her customers. The next year she placed several bowls with onions around in her shop. To her surprise, none of her staff got sick. It must work.. (And no, she is not in the onion business.)
  The moral of the story is, buy some onions and place them in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. We did it last year and we never got the flu.
  If this helps you and your loved ones from getting sick, all the better. If you do get the flu, it just might be a mild case..
  Whatever, what have you to lose? Just a few bucks on onions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Analysis: There's no scientific basis for this old wives' tale, which dates at least as far back as the 1500s, when it was believed that distributing raw onions around a residence protected inhabitants from the bubonic plague. This was long before germs were discovered, and the prevalent theory held that contagious diseases were spread by miasma , or 'noxious air.' The (false) assumption was that onions, whose absorbent qualities had been well known since ancient times, cleansed the air by trapping harmful odors.
  'When a home was visited by the plague,' writes Lee Pearson in Elizabethans at Home (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1957), 'slices of onion were laid on plates throughout the house and not removed till ten days after the last case had died or recovered. Since onions, sliced, were supposed to absorb elements of infection, they were also used in poultices to draw out infection.'
  In the ensuing centuries the technique remained a staple of folk medicine, with application not only as a preventative for the plague, but to ward off all kinds of epidemic diseases, including smallpox, influenza, and other 'infectious fevers.' The notion that onions were effective for this purpose even outlasted the concept of miasma, which gave way to the germ theory of infectious disease by the late 1800s.
  That transition is illustrated by passages from two different 19th-century texts, one of which claims that sliced onions are capable of absorbing a 'poisonous atmosphere,' while the other says onions will absorb 'all the germs' in a sickroom.
  'Whenever and wherever a person is suffering from any infectious fever,' we read in Duret's Practical Household Cookery , published in 1891, 'let a peeled onion be kept on a plate in the room of the patient. No one will ever catch the disease, provided the said onion be replaced every day by one freshly peeled, as then it will have absorbed the whole of the poisonous atmosphere of the room, and become black.'
  And, in an article published in the Western Dental Journal in 1887, we read: 'It has been repeatedly observed that an onion patch in the immediate vicinity of a house acts as a shield against the pestilence. Sliced onions in a sick room absorb all the germs and prevent contagion.'
  There is, of course, no more scientific basis for the belief that onions absorb all the germs in a room than the belief that onions rid the air of 'infectious poisons.' Viruses and bacteria can become airborne via droplets of saliva or mucus when people cough or sneeze, but they don't, generally speaking, hover in the atmosphere like gases and odors. By what physical process — other than magic — is this 'absorption' supposed to take place?
  2014 update: A new variant of this message began circulating in 2014 which claimed — again without any scientific basis — that placing sliced raw onions on the soles of someone's feet and covering them with socks overnight will 'take away illness.'

  Viral alert warns that evildoers are exposing innocent victims to the AIDS virus by attaching HIV-contaminated needles to gas pump handles.

  Example: Email contributed by R. Anderson, June 13, 2000:
  Please read and forward to anyone you know who drives.
  My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.
  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months.
  We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.
  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.
  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.
  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.

  2013 version via social media: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 26, 2013:
  HIV/AIDS Needles hidden under gas pumps
  In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIC positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
  Analysis: Not to worry. On June 20, 2000, mere days after the overwrought warning above first slammed inboxes across the Internet, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department issued a press release declaring it a hoax.
  'The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has had no reports of such incidents and there is no 'Capt. Abraham Sands' at the JSO,' the statement said. Nor had any such incidents been reported elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, according to the CDC, there are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted via needle-sticks in non-health care settings, ever (see statement below).
  The viral warning was, and is, entirely fictitious.
  It did add an interesting new wrinkle to the HIV needle-stick rumors already circulating online in various forms since 1997. Previous variants warned of tainted syringes planted in movie theater seats and pay phone coin slots , not to mention random 'stealth prickings' (for lack of a better phrase) in night clubs and other crowded public places. Now we have tainted needles on the handles of gas pumps to contend with. Where will they turn up next?
  Copycat pranks
  All these variants have been investigated and deemed false by authorities with the sole exception of a spate of apparent copycat pranks that occurred around the beginning of 1999 in western Virginia. According to police there, actual hypodermic needles were found in the coin slots of public phones and bank night deposit slots in a couple of small towns in the area. None were found to be contaminated with HIV or any other biological agent. Presumably the pranksters were imitating rumors that had already been circulating online for months.
  Groundless though it may be, the conviction that unknown assailants are intentionally spreading AIDS by hiding contaminated needles in public places remains popular, especially on the email forwarding circuit. One reason is that these tales and other urban legends like them provide an outlet for unspoken fears — of strangers, of the motives of some of the more marginal members of society, of AIDS itself. They're cautionary tales , albeit ones that don't really function as such — not literally, at any rate — in that they fail to address the primary way HIV is actually transmitted: unsafe sex.
  'Pump' at your own risk
  Which raises an interesting point. By virtue of the fact that each of these fictitious scenarios depicts the transmission of HIV via acts of penetration, each works as a metaphor for sex. Consider the claim that one risks exposure to HIV simply by inserting one's finger into the coin slot of a public phone. The imagery isn't pretty, but it's apt.
  Now we're being warned to be careful when pumping gas , to take all due precautions before sliding the nozzle into the tank.
  Sound advice? Metaphorically speaking, yes!
  Statement from the CDC on needle-stick rumors and AIDS:
  Have people been infected with HIV from being stuck by needles in non-health care settings?
  No. While it is possible to get infected with HIV if you are stuck with a needle that is contaminated with HIV, there are no documented cases of transmission outside of a health-care setting.
  CDC has received inquiries about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC 'confirmed' the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to be rumors/myths.

"Mastectomy Bill in Congress","http://womensissues.about.com/od/womensbodiesminds/a/ElectiveMastect.htm","'I Chose a Prophylactic Double Mastectomy...and I Didn't Have Breast Cancer'","2008-10-28 16:10:14","  She knows some will say that her prophylactic double mastectomy was a radical choice and that she might never have developed breast cancer.
  But she wasn't willing to live with the threat hanging over her head.
  Sophie has told very few friends and relatives about what she's done, partly because her privacy is important to her and partly because she knows reactions may vary. In a culture where many women choose lumpectomy instead of mastectomy to keep their breasts intact, she understands how painful and difficult a decision like this can be.
  In her own words, Sophie explains why she chose a double mastectomy and how it's changed her life.
  My sister and I both grew up under the “breast cancer” cloud. Our mother was diagnosed at age 34 and died at 41. The knowledge that breast cancer could be hereditary was with me 24/7.
  I know other women growing up with a family history of breast cancer feel the same way. You know what your legacy is, but because you're in your twenties you still feel immune. However, every form you fill out, every interview you have in the examining room, your family history looms large. Nobody wants to take any chances with you.
  It wasn't until my 30th birthday - when I had my baseline mammogram and my chart had the stamp of “family history”- that the fear began.
  The grief of my mother's loss, and the knowledge that it was due to breast cancer had always been present in my life. But once I turned 30 and became a mother, the fear kicked in. I had so much more to lose now. I didn't want to leave my children motherless as I had been.
  Each year I had annual mammograms and extra exams by a surgeon.
  Extra precautions were taken including many biopsies that turned up nothing but frayed nerves. The mammograms were especially unnerving. 'Seek and you shall find,' I thought...and worried. Each year as I sat in my gown waiting to be told I could get dressed and no more “views” were needed, I thought, 'This could be it—the year it happens to me.'
  When I was 36 I decided to take the test for the breast cancer gene: BRCA 1 & 2. It was a simple blood test. I paid around $1,000 out of pocket. I made a deal with myself. If the genetic test came back negative I would let myself off the hook. I would continue to be vigilant about early detection but I wouldn’t identify so much with every woman’s sad breast cancer story. I would try to remind myself that I wasn’t doomed and breast cancer wasn’t coming to get me as it had my mother. We didn’t know if my mother carried the gene but if I tested negative I would assume (or pretend) that I was in the general female population and maybe a diagnosis of breast cancer was not my fate.
  The test came back negative. I cried with relief. I knew from my research that hereditary breast cancers were actually the minority of cases but l I was still relieved in a big way that I didn’t carry the breast cancer gene.
  The black cloud dissipated for a few years. But then it came back with a vengeance.
  My sister was diagnosed with pre-menopausal breast cancer at age 48. It was a nightmare but on some level we knew it was coming.
  That’s just how it feels when you live under the cloud.
  My sister had a double mastectomy, chemo, radiation, hair loss—the works.
  'Okay,' I thought. 'Time to make another deal with myself.' I asked my sister to undergo genetic testing. I reasoned that if she tested positive for the breast cancer gene I could let myself off the hook big time since I tested negative. I could assume it was hereditary and I escaped.
  If she tested negative I would assume it does run in our family and they just haven’t identified the genetic code for this kind of aggressive familial breast cancer. In that case I would have a prophylactic double mastectomy.
  She tested negative.
  I knew I was next.
  And finally, that was what led me to this decision.
  For years, I'd thought about having a prophylactic double mastectomy and wondered what compelling thing would have to happen in my life for me to do it. If any biopsy came back positive...when I heard of new people being diagnosed...I thought about what I'd do.
  Since a close family member was an oncologist, I knew about every different circumstance and all the possibilities and options out there.
  When I heard what other people had done and how they took different approaches, I remember thinking, 'If that had been me, that breast would have come off.'
  So when my sister was diagnosed - and the genetic testing showed we were both negative for the breast cancer gene -I opted to have my breasts removed.
  I’ve heard people, including some doctors, say that having two healthy breasts removed in the name of prevention is a radical step. Not for me.
  I realize there might have been a possibility that I'd never develop breast cancer.
  But it's not about statistics - it's about how you feel inside. It gets to the point that you just don't want this hanging over your head anymore.
  I was married, had my children and was ready to say good-bye to my two anxiety provoking appendages.
  To be perfectly honest, I was more afraid of the enormity of the mastectomy and reconstruction process than sad over losing my breasts. I’ve always been a baby about medical procedures and this whole thing seemed too bad to be true.
  I had to find a general surgeon to remove the breasts and then find a plastic surgeon to work side-by-side with him to start the reconstruction process.
  If you opt to have reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy you need to have “expanders” placed behind the chest muscle and have saline injected into the “expanders” every few weeks until you have reached your desired breast size.
  Then you have another surgery where the permanent implants replace the expanders.
  So I did all that, but I kept it a secret from nearly everyone except a few close friends. It was a personal decision that I didn’t want to discuss for several reasons, the main one being personal privacy.
  Breasts are a private part that we keep hidden from the public. I had a large chest growing up and when I was younger, guys stared at it and I was never flattered - I felt uncomfortable. Once I had the double mastectomy, I didn't want to be the object of curiosity. I didn't want to invite more people to stare at my reconstructed chest.
  There are a couple of positives that the implants offer. Because I was large chested, the shoulder straps of my bras always dug into my shoulders. If I wanted any support, I had to wear uncomfortable underwire bras that I would always take off the minute I got home. With implants, you don't need to wear a bra, thus no more uncomfortable straps. Another benefit is that your breasts are now firm and perky. No more 'National Geographic Hanging Breast' syndrome - I finally had more than a few inches between my belly button and the bottom of my breasts. It makes you look younger and thinner.
  Still, it's not worth the trade. The first year, every time I went to roll on my side in bed at night, I woke up from the pain. There was the healing process, and there was soreness.
  I discovered there isn’t any real support for women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy. The support goes to the women who are having the surgery because of a cancer diagnosis, and rightly so. They have a lot more challenges ahead of them than I did.
  My plastic surgeon’s office offered very little information of any kind. I had to call them the day before the surgery to ask what I should bring to wear home from the hospital.
  I had no idea what to expect. The only information came from a 5 minute video I saw in the office that detailed the surgical procedure. The film was geared toward breast cancer patients.
  They didn't give me any guidance or support, or explain all the things I should be doing to make healing easier. Technically, my surgeon did a good job but I had no idea of what to expect afterwards.
  Keeping it a secret makes it more difficult to get first-hand information and advice. If you join a breast cancer support group you have any number of people to help you with the process. While you're in the hospital, a survivor visits you and provides support. But if you're not a survivor and you keep it a secret, you miss out on that support.
  Because I didn’t share my situation I did not have a ‘community’ of people helping me. I traded emotional support and casseroles for privacy.
  My plastic surgeon was technically proficient but a real jerk. He inserted implants that were not the size I asked for. They were huge and too big for my frame. I had to wait three months and have the implant surgery redone by someone else.
  During that time I googled answers to my many questions, relying on a few excellent plastic surgery websites that offered detailed information.
  At the time I did this, all the plastic surgery-based TV reality shows were big hits. You could see surgeons reshaping imperfections. I couldn't help but compare those TV results to my misshapen results -an end product that even doctors themselves admit falls short of what reconstructive breast surgery should be able to achieve.
  Although these shows provided a glimpse of what goes on, every woman who's undergone reconstructive surgery at the time of her mastectomy knows it's a lengthy and challenging medical procedure. And afterwards, I couldn't complain to my doctors about the outcome. The surgeon who inserted the too-large implants was very dismissive when I asked about the cosmetic results, saying to me, 'Be thankful that you don't have cancer.'
  However, the relief in not having any breasts far outweighed anything else.
  My children were too young to understand what was going on, so I simply said I was going to be in the hospital for a few days. I explained, 'Because Mommy's sister just had breast cancer and Mommy doesn't want to get it, they have invented a special operation where they scoop out the insides of Mommy's breast and give me a new inside so I won't get cancer.' They just accepted what I said and we didn't talk about it all that much.
  I know what I went through as a young woman with a family history, so I would hate to pass on to a daughter the continuing worry of breast cancer. There's a feeling of doom that you internalize. I've had friends whose mothers also faced breast cancer and beat it. Our lives are so different. Their story isn't one that has a sad, sad ending. For a girl watching her mother die, it has a unique and profound effect on her and her life forever. For them, it's not on the front burner as it was for me.
  I read an article recently where a woman had a prophylactic double mastectomy and the doctor himself tried to talk her out of it, telling her it was a drastic measure and she really didn't need to do it. The woman said, 'They don't know what it's like walking around knowing that they may soon get breast cancer.' The removal of your breasts takes away that risk.
  If I were brave, I would have ridden it out. I wasn't brave - I was aggressive. My level of worry was escalating every year and I just couldn't live with the tension. Yet I can see how other people wouldn't make the choice that I made.
  If I were brave, I wouldn't have to eliminate the unknown fear. But I was scared and tired of being vigilant. The relief that I experience from not having the threat and worry of breast cancer hanging over my head far outweighs any hardship I experienced medically and emotionally.
  Today, I think nothing of these implants and I don't think of myself harboring a big secret.
  I don't worry about anyone's opinion of what I did. It isn't a matter of right or wrong. I saw it with such clarity - it was the best thing for me to do. And with all of it behind me, and the overwhelming fear no longer present in my life, I truly have no regrets.

  Passing on healthy info.
  I just wanted to pass some information on to you. I was watching Channel 2 this morning. They had a Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle Hospital on the program. He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the hospital. He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers. This applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastics releases dioxins into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Dioxins are carcinogens and highly toxic to the cells of our bodies.
  Instead, he recommends using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results without the dioxins. So such things as TV dinners, instant saimin and soups, etc. should be removed from the container and heated in something else.
  Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. Just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc. He said we might remember when some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper. The dioxin problem is one of the reasons.

  Plastic Wrap Toxins. Author/s: Jule Klotter Issue: Jan, 2001
  As a seventh grade student, Claire Nelson learned that di(ethylhexyl)adepate (DEHA), considered a carcinogen, is found in plastic wrap. She also learned that the FDA had never studied the effect of microwave cooking on plastic-wrapped food. Claire began to wonder: 'Can cancer-causing particles seep into food covered with household plastic wrap while it is being micro waved?'
  Three years later, with encouragement from her high school science teacher, Claire set out to test what the FDA had not. Although she had an idea for studying the effect of microwave radiation on plastic-wrapped food, she did not have the equipment. Eventually, Jon Wilkes at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, Arkansas, agreed to help her. The research center, which is affiliated with the FDA, let her use its facilities to perform her experiments, which involved micro waving plastic wrap in virgin olive oil. Claire tested four different plastic wraps and 'found not just the carcinogens but also xenoestrogen was migrating into the oil].. Xenoestrogens are linked to low sperm counts in men and to breast cancer in women.
  Throughout her junior and senior years, Claire made a couple of trips each week to the research center, which was 25 miles from her home, to work on her experiment. An article in Options reported that 'her analysis found that DEHA was migrating into the oil at between 200 parts and 500 parts per million. The FDA standard is 0.05 parts per billion.' Her summarized results have been published in science journals. Claire Nelson received the American Chemical Society's top science prize for students during her junior year and fourth place at the International Science and Engineering Fair (Fort Worth,Texas) as a senior.

  To add to this: Saran wrap placed over foods as they are nuked, with the high heat, actually drips poisonous toxins into the food. Use paper towel instead.

"Microwaved Water Explodes in Man's Face","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/Microwave-Water-Explode.htm","Can Microwaving Water Cause an Explosion?","2010-11-01 17:07:50","  Dear Urban Legends:
  I received this email that had been forwarded by many companies' safety departments. Apparently, there is actual science fact behind this, but the email is worded with all the normal Internet legend warning signs (e.g. the tragedy happening to the author's son, the doctor and hospital not being named, and the duration of heating not being specified).
  Is there a legitimate concern for the average microwave user? Or is this occurrence so rare that the email is really just another scare-o-gram?
  This is the text:
  Dear Reader:
  You're right, this narrative does display all the hallmarks of a typical viral 'scare-o-gram.' But, as you also observed, that doesn't mean it can't be true.
  First, let's consider the specific story about a 26-year-old man who suffered first- and second-degree burns after microwaved water exploded in his face. Is it factual word-for-word? We have no way of knowing. The author is anonymous, the alleged victim is anonymous, we are not told where or when the incident supposedly happened. We simply cannot verify its authenticity.
  So let's consider the scenario in a more generic sense. Is it plausible to think that something like what was described in the message can happen?
  The answer, evidently, is yes — under just the right circumstances.
  This safety warning posted online by the Gurnee, Illinois Fire Department:
  Scientists agree that this can happen, though they offer a somewhat more complicated explanation. As Richard Barton writes in New Scientist magazine, 'A portion of the water in the cup is becoming superheated — the liquid temperature is actually slightly above the boiling point, where it would normally form a gas.
  In this case, the boiling is hindered by a lack of nucleation sites needed to form the bubbles.'
  When water is heated on a conventional stove, the porous surface of the kettle and the convection caused by the hotter liquid rising from the bottom enable the water to convert to steam. It boils. But a stationary cup of water in a microwave oven can heat past the boiling point without actually boiling. If that happens, placing an object (like a teabag) in the water or jarring the cup could cause the sudden — and explosive — conversion of part of the water to steam.
  'I imagine,' adds Barton, 'that by keeping the cup still and microwaving for a long time, one could blow the entire contents of the cup into the interior of the microwave as soon as you introduced any nucleation sites.
  It is this sometimes explosive rate of steam production that means you should take great care when using a microwave oven.'
  So, we know it's possible. But is it common? Does it happen frequently? No, says Louis Bloomfield, professor of physics at the University of Virginia.
  'Fortunately, serious microwave superheating accidents are unusual — this is the first injury I've ever heard about.' Which contradicts the email's claim that such injuries are a 'fairly common occurrence.'
  A survey of the medical literature on microwave injuries also undermines that claim. There are references to trauma caused by everything from overheated pizza to exploding eggs , but no mentions I could find of serious injury due to surges or explosions of boiling water.
  Lastly, is the warning useful, or just an alarmist rumor? It falls somewhere in between, it seems to me. Manufacturers do recommend that foods or liquids heated in a microwave oven be allowed to stand for a time before they're touched or consumed. Sounds like good advice to me.

  Description: Email flier Circulating since: 2003 Status: False
  Email example contributed by Andre S., May 14, 2008:
  Comments: Prick a stroke victim's fingertips, squeeze them till they bleed, yank on their ear lobes, then start pricking those, too? This sounds more like torture than a proper medical treatment! Once upon a time -- and this is going back 100 years or more, mind you -- bloodletting was thought to be an appropriate treatment for stroke (or 'apoplexy,' as it was then called).
  Now we know better; or at least we ought to.
  According to About.com's stroke expert, Dr. Jose Vega , this message was clearly authored by someone with no real medical knowledge and shouldn't be taken seriously. Following the instructions above, in fact, might do more harm than good.
  'The email conveys multiple unfounded ideas about stroke,' Vega writes , 'but by far the most dangerous one of all is the suggestion that people should not be taken to a hospital until all their symptoms are resolved, on the grounds that 'all the capillaries in the brain will burst on the way to the hospital.' This statement is untrue and totally irresponsible.'
  The first thing you should do if you or someone you know exhibits symptoms of a stroke is call an ambulance. The most effective stroke treatment known, a blood thinner called tPA , must be administered within three hours of the onset of symptoms, so every minute counts. Delaying hospitalization for any reason may worsen the patient's prognosis.
  Bloodletting and apoplexy
  Prior to the 19th century, bloodletting was a standard 'cure' for practically everything, including stroke ('apoplexy').
  In western medicine the practice was based on the ancient Theory of Humours , which held that all disease results from an imbalance of four bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Siphoning off a certain amount of blood -- often copious amounts of it, actually -- was believed to restore the balance necessary for recovery from illness and long-term good health.
  Though advances in medical science led to the eventual abandonment of humour-based therapies, bloodletting continued to be prescribed as a treatment for apoplexy, albeit under a different rationale. With the recognition that blood pressure is a factor in arterial disease came the suggestion that bloodletting ought to be used to relieve the body of a 'superabundance' of blood. Despite cumulative evidence that this was ineffective as a stroke treatment (and in some cases even harmful), the practice continued on into the early 20th century.
  More recently (beginning in the 1960s), venesection (bloodletting by another name) has been proposed in conjunction with drug treatments as a means of reducing blood viscosity in stroke patients to enhance oxygen flow to the brain.
  Clinical tests of the procedure have proven inconclusive.
  Do not try this at home
  Turning to Chinese medicine, from which the specific notion of treating stroke victims by drawing blood from the fingertips appears to derive, a 2005 study published in the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine confirms that there is a precedent for such a technique, reporting that 'Bloodletting puncture at Twelve Well-Points of Hand can improve the consciousness of patients with brain injury in small area.' Please note, however, that the tests which formed the basis of this study were conducted on patients already diagnosed with and hospitalized for stroke, and nowhere is it recommended that any such treatment be tried in the home.

  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. READ IT AND FORWARD IT TO EVERYBODY!!!
  As all of you know, I have Primary Peritoneal Cancer. This cancer has only recently been identified as its OWN type of cancer; but it is, essentially, Ovarian Cancer. Both types of cancer are diagnosed in the same way (with the 'tumor marker' CA-125 blood test), and they are treated in the same way (surgery to remove the primary tumor and then chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin).
  Having gone through this ordeal, I want to save others from the same fate. That is why I am sending this message to you and hope you will print it and give it or send it via e-mail to everybody you know.
  One thing I have learned is that each of us must take TOTAL responsibility for our own health care. I thought I had done that because I always had an annual physical, had my annual mammogram and PAP smear, did monthly Self Breast Exam, went to the dentist at least twice/year, etc. I even insisted on a sigmoidoscopy and a bone density test last year.
  When I had a total hysterectomy in 1993, I thought that I did not have to worry about getting any of the female reproductive organ cancers. LITTLE DID I KNOW! I don't have ovaries (and they were HEALTHY when they were removed!), but I have what is essentially ovarian cancer. Strange, isn't it? These are just SOME of the things our Doctors never tell us.
  ONE OUT OF EVERY 55 WOMEN WILL GET OVARIAN OR PRIMARY PERITONEAL CANCER! THE 'CLASSIC' SYMPTOMS ARE AN ABDOMEN THAT RATHER SUDDENLY ENLARGES AND CONSTIPATION AND/OR DIARRHEA.
  I had these classic symptoms and went to the Doctor. Because these symptoms seemed to be 'abdominal,' I went to a gastroenterologist. He ran tests that were designed to determine whether there was a bacterial infection; these tests were negative, and I was diagnosed with 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome.' I guess I would have accepted this diagnosis had it not been for my enlarged abdomen. I swear to you, it looked like I was 4-5 months pregnant! I, therefore, insisted on more tests. They took an X-Ray of my abdomen; it was negative. I was, again, assured that I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome and was encouraged to go on my scheduled month-long trip to Europe. I couldn't wear any of my slacks or shorts because I couldn't get them buttoned, and I KNEW something was radically wrong. I INSISTED on more tests, and they (reluctantly) scheduled me for a CT-Scan (just to shut me up, I think). This is what I mean by taking charge of our own health care.
  The CT-Scan showed a lot of fluid in my abdomen (NOT normal!). Needless to say, I had to cancel my trip and have FIVE POUNDS of fluid drawn off at the hospital (not a pleasant procedure, I assure you, but NOTHING compared to what was ahead of me). Tests revealed cancer cells in the fluid. Finally, finally, finally, the Doctor ran a CA-125 blood test and I was properly diagnosed.
  I HAD THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS FOR OVARIAN CANCER AND, YET, THIS SIMPLE CA-125 BLOOD TEST HAD NEVER BEEN RUN ON ME ... NOT AS PART OF MY ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM AND NOT WHEN I WAS SYMPTOMATIC. THIS IS AN INEXPENSIVE AND SIMPLE BLOOD TEST!!!
  PLEASE, PLEASE, P-L-E-A-S-E TELL ALL YOUR FEMALE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES TO INSIST ON A CA-125 BLOOD TEST EVERY YEAR AS PART OF THEIR ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAMS. BE FOREWARNED THAT THEIR DOCTORS MIGHT TRY TO TALK THEM OUT OF IT, SAYING 'IT ISN'T NECESSARY.' BELIEVE ME, HAD I KNOWN THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW, WE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT MY CANCER MUCH EARLIER (BEFORE IT WAS A STAGE 3 CANCER)!!! INSIST ON THE CA-125 BLOOD TEST; DON'T TAKE 'NO' FOR AN ANSWER.
  THE NORMAL RANGE FOR A CA-125 BLOOD TEST IS BETWEEN ZERO AND 35. (MINE WAS 754 ... THAT'S RIGHT, 754!) IF THE NUMBER IS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED, YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER ONE DONE IN THREE OR SIX MONTHS AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON IT JUST LIKE WOMEN DO WHEN THEY HAVE FIBROID TUMORS OR WHEN MEN HAVE A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED PSA TEST (PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGENS) THAT HELPS DIAGNOSE PROSTATE CANCER. HAVING THE CA-125 TEST DONE ANNUALLY CAN ALERT YOU EARLY, AND THAT'S THE GOAL IN DIAGNOSING ANY TYPE OF CANCER -- CATCH IT EARLY.
  I hope I haven't bored you with all of this. But I hope I HAVE scared you enough to motivate you to action. Do YOU know 55 women? If so, at least one of them will have this VERY AGGRESSIVE cancer -- and maybe, just maybe, it will be YOU. I hope not.
  Please, go to your Doctor THIS WEEK and insist on a CA-125 test and have one EVERY YEAR for the rest of your life. And forward this message to every woman you know and tell all of your female family members and friends. As the Nike ads say, 'JUST DO IT!'
  Please don't think youth will protect you, either. Though the median age for this cancer is 56 (and, guess what, I'm exactly 56), women as young as 22 have it. Age is not a factor.
  Thank you for your time. My best wishes for your continued good health. Carolyn Benivegna

"Raw Onions on Feet to Cure Illness?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/Raw-Onions-On-Feet-To-Cure-Illness.htm","No, Onions on Feet Won't Cure Sickness","2014-01-23 17:43:08","  By David Emery
  A viral message making the social media rounds claims that placing sliced raw onions on the bottoms of one's feet and securing them with white socks before going to bed will 'take away illness' overnight as the onions absorb toxins from the body. Some also say it prevents the flu.
  Description: Folk remedy Circulating since: January 2014 Status: False
  Strapping raw onions to your feet probably won't do you any harm as long as it isn't used as a substitute for proper medical care, but there's no scientific reason to suppose it will cure what's ailing you, either.
  The claim that onions are 'toxin absorbers' is pseudo-scientific twaddle, as is the related claim that you should never save a leftover onion because 'it will absorb all the toxins in the air of your refrigerator.' This is a revised version of an older claim to the effect that ' onions are a magnet for bacteria ,' therefore, supposedly, 'it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag.'
  continue reading below our video
  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  That's just plain false , says Joe Schwarcz of McGill University's Office for Science and Society. 'The fact is that onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination,' he writes. 'In fact, quite the opposite.' According to Schwarcz it's no more dangerous to eat cut onions stored properly in a refrigerator than it is to eat any other raw vegetable stored for an equal length of time.
  This is reaffirmed by Dr. Ruth MacDonald , Professor of food science and human nutrition at Iowa State University. 'No, onions do not absorb bacteria,' MacDonald says . 'The idea that a vegetable would attract and suck into itself bacteria from the air is not even logical. The onion may turn black because it would eventually rot from both cell breakdown events and bacterial contamination if you left it out, not because it absorbs germs.'
  And not because it absorbs so-called 'toxins,' either. I've not found a single scientific source stating that onions are especially prone to absorbing 'toxins' of any kind, much less those specifically related to disease.
  It's true that 500 years ago it was believed that strewing onions around the home protected against the plague, but there are two important caveats to bear in mind: one, that belief was based on an ignorance of what actually causes infectious disease and how it's spread, and two, the theory behind it wasn't that onions absorb germs or 'toxins,' but rather that onions absorb noxious odors (miasma), which were thought at the time to be the main vehicle of contagion.
  The miasma theory began to lose steam as medical science progressed in the latter half of the 19th century , but we still find sources like The People's Physician , a home medical manual published in 1860, stating that raw onions 'possess the property of imbibing the morbid effluvia, or noxious exhalations from persons diseased.' A few sentences later the author makes this now-familiar recommendation:
  Persons threatened with or having seated fevers, should have the half of a raw onion bound upon the sole of each foot at bedtime , being permitted to remain until morning, by which time the slices will have drawn, to a great extent, the febrile disorder from the system.
  By the 1880s, references to 'morbid effluvia' and 'noxious exhalations' were giving way to talk of germs and bacteria, but the onion remedy, albeit slightly modernized, still held sway in some quarters, as in this example from the Western Dental Journal , 1887: 'Sliced onions in a sick room absorb all the germs and prevent contagion.'
  Now, more than 125 years later, we read on Facebook that onions cure disease by absorbing 'toxins,' as if it's a long-established medical fact.
  Regardless whether the agent of infection is thought to be miasma, germs, or toxins, what none of these sources provides is a scientific explanation of how the humble onion could be capable of performing such an incredible absorptive feat. So far as I've been able to discover, there isn't one.
  Are Leftover Onions Poisonous? Viral message claims that uncooked, leftover onions are 'poisonous' because they're 'a huge magnet for bacteria' and therefore especially prone to spoilage.
  Can Raw Onions in a Room Prevent the Flu? Viral message claims raw, sliced onions placed around the home will 'collect' or 'absorb' any flu virus present and protect the household from influenza.
  Vicks VapoRub on Feet to Relieve Coughing? Viral message claims coughing in children can be stopped '100% of the time' by applying 'Vicks Vapor Rub' to the bottoms of their feet at bedtime.

  Subject: Breast Cancer Warning
  Following is a message I got from a friend to pass along:
  In Nov. I lost my sister (Betty Botts of Troy, Al.) to a rare kind of breast cancer. She developed a rash on her breast similar to that of young mothers who are nursing. Because her mammogram had been clear, the Dr. treated her with antibiotics for infections. After 2 rounds and it continued to get worse her Dr. sent her for another mammogram and this time showed mass. A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy; chemo was started in order to shrink the growth; then mastectomy; then a full round of chemo; then radiation. After about 9 months of intense treatment she was given a clean bill of health.
  One year of living each day to its fullest--then it returned to the liver area. She took 4 treatments and decided that she wanted quality of life, not the after effects of chemo. We had 5 great months and she planned each detail of the final days. After just a few days of needing morphine, she slipped away saying she had done what God had sent her into the world to do and now it was her time to go. I still have tears as I write, but our message would be like the one below-- to be alert to anything that is not normal--and be persistent in getting help as soon as possible. Juanita Bush
  Ladies, take note:
  This is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast, on the nipple and aureola. It appeared as a rash which later became a lesion with a crusty outer edge. I would not have ever suspected it to be breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seemed any different to me, but the rash bothered me so I went to my doctor for that. Sometimes it itched and was sore, but other than that it didn't really bother me. It was just ugly and a nuisance, and could not be cleared up with all the creams prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes just prior to this outbreak. They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be cancerous. Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast cancer.
  What are the symptoms? Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola. One of the biggest problems with Paget's disease of the nipple is that the symptoms appear to be harmless. It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infection, leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care.
  The symptoms include:
  1. A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it to itch and burn. ( As I stated mine did not itch or burn much, and had no oozing I was aware of, but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one side).
  2. A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the aureola area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple).
  3. Usually only one nipple is affected.
  How is it diagnosed? Your doctor will do a physical exam and should Suggest having a mammogram of both breasts done immediately. Even though the redness, oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast. Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on. They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for cancer. If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or suggest radiation treatments.
  Had my doctor caught mine right away, instead of flaking it off as dermatitis, perhaps they could have saved my breast, and it wouldn't have gone to my lymph nodes. This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your friends as possible; it could save someone's life.
  My breast cancer has spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. If this had been diagnosed in the beginning as breast cancer and treated right away, perhaps it would not have spread. I did try to spread the word through Rosie O'Donnell show on breast cancer awareness, but it failed to trigger importance enough to announce on her show last year. This is sad as woman are not aware of Paget's disease. If by passing this around on the e-mail, we can make others aware of it, and it's potential danger we are helping women everywhere.
  Please, if you can, take a moment to cut and paste this information into an e-mail and share it with a friend. It only takes a moment yet the results could save a life.
  Please pass this on to as many people as you can.
  Analysis by Peter Kohler: There are probably more instances just now of the above missive being forwarded - without any research having been done about it - to email inboxes, than there are present and actual cases of the condition itself in existence amongst the women in the world. Face it, folks: we scare easily.
  This is not to diminish the seriousness of the illness, for those who have it or for those near to them. Paget's disease of the breast, or cancer of the nipple, is a real though quite rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 5 percent of all cases of breast cancer.
  So how come when previous searches for 'Paget's Disease' were conducted on the About network, all that was found were articles concerning a bone disease? Because this commentary had not yet been written! And by the way, the confusion over the names occurs because both conditions were first described by the same British surgeon, Sir James Paget, over one hundred years ago.
  You can visit the following websites for more reliable information about this matter. If you wish to share this information with friends and relatives, please don't forward the email rumor. Direct them instead to these websites so they can feel confident about the information they're getting:

  Description: Home remedy Circulating since: 2007 Status: Anecdotal
  Example: Email text contributed by David C., March 26, 2007:
  Analysis: While not disproven, the above claims have neither been scientifically tested nor confirmed, nor is there a generally accepted medical explanation for how smearing Vicks VapoRub on the soles of one's feet might possibly relieve a coughing fit. Some people who have tried it insist the treatment really works, but a smattering of anecdotal reports does not amount to proof.
  'From the standpoint of traditional medicine,' says pediatrician Vincent Iannelli, MD , 'there is no good reason that rubbing Vicks VapoRub on a child's feet should help a cough. In fact, many studies show that over-the-counter cough medicines don't even help when you use them as they are intended.
  'Why might it work?' he continues. 'It could be that your child can still breathe the vapors, even if you put it on their feet. Or maybe the active ingredient, menthol, acts to dilate the blood vessels in the feet, and this triggers some reflex that quiets the cough. There are other reflexes that cause coughs, like we often see when we clean wax out of children's ears, so it is not unthinkable that there are others.'
  The remedy wouldn't have seemed so strange to doctors a hundred years ago, who often prescribed liniments and poultices containing mild irritants such as mustard, garlic, or camphor to the chest and to the soles of the feet to relieve symptoms of colds and whooping cough.
  Like Vicks VapoRub , the active ingredients of which include camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol, these preparations would have had the effect of stimulating blood flow to the skin. Cataloged under the heading of 'counter-irritants' in early twentieth-century medical texts, such treatments were based on the principle that 'internal morbid processes may at times be relieved by creating external irritations' ( Horatio Charles Wood in Therapeutics: Its Principles and Practice , 1908).
  To be sure, there was vigorous debate over how counter-irritants actually worked. 'One commonly offered explanation,' wrote pharmacologist Horatio Wood at the time, 'is that there is only a certain amount of blood in the body, and that if the blood be drawn to one part there must be less in another part. Surely, however, the amount of blood drawn to the skin by a mustard plaster is too small sensibly to affect the general mass in the body. It is more probable that the phenomena of counter-irritation are the result of reflex disturbances of the vaso-motor nerves which influence the size of the blood vessels, or of the trophic nerves which directly affect nutrition.'
  Whatever the anatomical explanation, back in the day such treatments were liberally prescribed and believed to be effective. Dr. Alvin Wood Chase's embrocation for whooping cough, for example, consisted of equal parts oil of amber and spirits of hartshorn (ammonia). 'Apply to the soles of the feet, and to the palms of the hands, morning, noon, and night,' he advised in Dr. Chase's Recipes (1876).
  In A Text-Book of Practical Medicine (1883), Dr. Felix von Niemeyer prescribed the following for croup: 'The application of sinapisms [mustard plasters] to the calves of the legs and soles of the feet, repeated bathing of the hands and forearms in water as hot as the child can bear, the use of 'flying blisters' to the neck and chest, are recommended, partly to corroborate the action of the stimulants administered internally, and partly as a derivative from the larynx to the skin.'
  The 1909 edition of Johnson's First Aid Manual recommended the same.
  Even though such remedies have largely fallen out of favor among mainstream doctors, they have survived in the form of folk wisdom and we still find them touted in textbooks of holistic medicine. 'A time-honored treatment for chest colds,' writes Kathi Kemper in The Holistic Pediatrician , 'is the mustard poultice .
  Mustard poultices apparently increase circulation to your child's chest, creating a soothing sense of warmth.' A garlic or onion poultice can also be used, Kemper says, noting that some herbalists 'recommend that the garlic poultice be placed over the soles of the feet to draw heat downward.'
  'Other folk remedies placed on the feet to draw the circulation downward,' she continues, 'are turpentine and camphor ' — which, as it happens, are two of the active ingredients in Vicks VapoRub, which brings us full circle.
  Judging from the volume of reader testimonials published by The People's Pharmacy authors Joe and Terry Graedon in their newspaper columns in recent years, putting Vicks on your feet is nothing short of a miracle cure.
  'I was looking for home remedies for coughs when I found your Website,' wrote one correspondent. 'I read about putting Vicks VapoRub on the soles of the feet. Within ten minutes of applying it, he was asleep without a cough. Thanks!'
  'We can't explain how smearing Vicks on the soles of the feet could take away a cough,' the Graedons replied, 'but many others have told us it works.
  Be sure to put socks on him to protect the sheets.'
  While Vicks is surely harmless enough when used as directed, parents should be aware that applying it to children's feet as a cough remedy is not among the uses recommended by the manufacturer. To quote Dr. Iannelli: 'As with other alternative treatments, herbal therapies, or simply using over-the-counter or prescription medicines 'off-label' or in a way that they weren't intended, parents should be aware that there can be consequences. Kids can have sensitive feet, and applying a cream or ointment that may act like an irritant could cause a rash that looks like athlete's foot. This rash, juvenile plantar dermatosis, is also commonly seen in kids who have sweaty feet or who don't change their socks often enough.'

  Summary: Forwarded email says that Sherwood Brands Pirate's Gold Milk Chocolate Coins imported from China may contain deadly melamine and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has warned the public not to eat, distribute or sell the candy.

  Email example contributed by Liz P., Oct. 22, 2008:
  With Halloween fast approaching comes a warning to parents and kids regarding Sherwood brand Pirate's Gold milk chocolate coins imported from China.
  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is warning the public not to eat, distribute or sell the candy.
  It is sold across Canada by Costco and may also have been sold in bulk packages or as individual pieces at various dollar and bulk stores.
  The chocolate contains melamine which is the same chemical responsible for killing several babies in China, and sickening thousands more.
  Comments: True. Canadian news sources confirm that more than 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds) of Sherwood Brands Pirate's Gold Milk Chocolate Coins manufactured in China were recalled from store shelves on October 8, 2008 after they were found to contain melamine , a toxic chemical compound.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says the gold foil-wrapped chocolates were being sold at Costco and other bulk and dollar stores across Canada. Though the amount of melamine found in the candy was very low and no injuries have been reported, the agency decided to issue a warning because the distribution of the product was so wide.
  The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has not issued a recall because the product was only distributed in Canada, a representative of the agency told the Akron Beacon Journal . The FDA says it has taken 'aggressive action' to ensure that no melamine-contaminated products reach store shelves in the United States.

"Prescription Drug Pricing","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/medicalnews/a/fakeviagra.htm","FDA Warns of Fake Viagra, Lipitor and Evista","2005-05-15 12:56:24","  By Robert Longley
  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning consumers to be on the lookout for fake versions of the popular prescription drugs Lipitor, Viagra, and a non FDA-approved drug being marketed as 'generic Evista' currently being sold in Mexican border towns.
  The FDA advises anyone possessing or encountering any of these counterfeit drugs not to use them and to contact their doctor or a registered pharmacist immediately. Prescription drugs purchased in foreign countries may be less expensive, but are not regulated by the FDA and do not carry the same FDA assurances of safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality as drugs purchased within the United States.
  What's wrong with the counterfeit drugs? They contain no or very little active ingredients, according to the FDA.
  In a recent press release, the FDA states, 'Counterfeit versions of Lipitor (a cholesterol-lowering drug), Viagra (a treatment for erectile dysfunction), and Evista (a treatment and prevention medication for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women) can pose significant risks to consumers.
  Counterfeit Lipitor that contains no active ingredient or not enough active ingredient could present a long-term risk for the various complications of high cholesterol, such as heart disease. The counterfeit product purchased in Mexico was associated with several reports of high cholesterol in consumers who had used the product. Counterfeit Viagra that contains little or no active ingredient would be less effective than a legitimate product or altogether ineffective. Women who take the substandard generic Evista product that contains no active ingredient may be at risk for developing osteoporosis or for having their osteoporosis progress.'
  The 'generic Evista' was analyzed by FDA in coordination with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and was found to contain no active ingredient. The counterfeit Lipitor and counterfeit Viagra were analyzed by Pfizer, Inc. and were also found to contain no active ingredient.'
  The 'generic Evista' product was purchased from Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico and is labeled as 'Raloxifeno, fenilox, 50 tabletas, 60mg', made or distributed by Litio and labeled as manufactured in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The label has red triangles across the top and bottom. (See the website noted below for photographs of the products.)
  Counterfeit Lipitor and Viagra were purchased in the Mexican border towns of Juarez, Los Algodones, Nogales, and Tijuana . The counterfeit Lipitor and counterfeit Viagra products were labeled only in English, whereas legitimate Mexican pharmaceuticals are usually labeled in Spanish. In addition, the counterfeit Lipitor was provided in round white plastic bottles; however authentic Lipitor in Mexico is sold only in boxes of blister packs.
  FDA and Mexican federal health officials are continuing to work together to address the issue of counterfeit human drug products, especially along our common border. Recently, federal health officials in Mexico's Federal Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) have undertaken several specific operations to target illegal drugs, including counterfeit drugs, in Mexican drug stores. These operations, throughout Mexico, including the areas that border on the U.S. have resulted in the suspension of 19 pharmacies and the confiscation and recall of over 105 tons of medicines.
  Consumers should report these and any other suspected counterfeit drugs to FDA at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm .

"Rat Droppings/Urine Cause Hawaiian Man's Death","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blrats2.htm","Lethal Rat Droppings / Rat Urine","2016-03-28 21:38:50","  By David Emery
  Description: Viral alert / Forwarded email Circulating since: Sept. 1999 Status: Fictionalized, overblown (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Alpha Lau, Sep. 16, 1999:
  Subject: Be careful of Rats' droppings.
  A stock clerk was sent to clean up a storeroom at their Maui location.
  Then he got back, he was complaining that the storeroom was really filthy, and that he had noticed dried mouse or rat droppings in some areas.
  A couple of days later, he started feeling like he was coming down with stomach flu, achy joints, headache, and he started throwing up. He went to bed and never really got up. Within two days he was so ill and weak. His blood sugar count was down to 66 and his face and eyeballs were yellow. He was rushed to the emergency at Pali Momi, where they said he was suffering from massive organ failure!
  The doctor, in ER, transferred him to St. Francis Hospital and notifies all his relatives as he didn't had long to live. In ICU of St. Francis Hospital, a team of doctors were trying desperately to stabilize him. They said that even if by some miracle he pulled through, he would need a new liver, kidneys, pancreas and bladder. He died shortly before midnight.
  None of us would have ever made the connection between his job and his death, but the doctors specifically asked if he had been in a warehouse or exposed to dried rat or mouse droppings at any time.
  They said there is a virus (much like Hanta virus) that lives in dried rat and mouse droppings. Once dried, these droppings are like dust, and can easily be inhaled or ingested if a person is not careful to wash their hands and face thoroughly, or wear protective gear. An autopsy is being conducted to verify the doctors' suspicions and tissue samples have been sent to the CDC in Atlanta.
  Please be extremely careful to always rinse off the tops of any canned sodas or foods, and wipe off pasta packaging, cereal boxes, etc. Almost everything you buy in a supermarket was stored in a warehouse at one time or another, and stores themselves often have rodents. I worked in grocery wholesaling long enough to know that even the cleanest store has mice or rats.
  Whenever you buy any canned soft drink, please make sure that you wash the top with running water and soap, or if not available, drink with a straw. A family friend's friend died after drinking can of soda! Apparently, she did not clean the top before drinking from the can. The top was encrusted with dried rat's urine, which is toxic and obviously lethal!!!! canned drinks and other foodstuffs are stored in warehouses and containers that are usually infested with rodents and then get transported to the retail outlets without being properly cleaned.
  Please forward this message to the people you care about...
  Analysis by Carla Homan: In case anyone was wondering why rats never took off as popular domestic pets, consider briefly their association with death and disease. With a list of horrors such as the bubonic plague, hantavirus and leptospirosis credited to them, it's no wonder people will so easily accept the notion that rats in and of themselves are lethal.
  The fact is, the urine of a healthy rat is quite safe to consume... though I would recommend moderating your daily intake. What a relief, eh? This email is a variant of an earlier warning (see ' It's the Lethal Thing ' for a previous feature explaining away your rat urine fears), with a dead stock clerk inserted for additional hysteria value.
  Still, the story of the store clerk cleaning the stockroom and contracting a hantavirus is not preposterous. In fact, a scenario on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website sounds similar, involving someone cleaning out a seldom used, rodent infested area, and contracting the virus after breathing in dust particles from the dried rat droppings. The excretions of diseased rats can indeed pose a health threat to humans (see resources below for cautionary information).
  Regarding the specific claims in the email, an inquiry to the Hawaii Department of Health yielded the following response from Dr. Philip Bruno, Chief of the DOH Communicable Disease Division:
  'The State of Hawaii Department of Health investigated this question last year, and has shared its findings with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The email is not true. There have been no known hantavirus cases in Hawaii. The email may be a hoax, or a misinterpretation of some other event.'
  In case you're still worried, the CDC has several resources on preventing the bubonic plague , the hantavirus and other rat-borne illnesses. They do not mention soda cans. Instead, they talk about controlling the local rat population, good sanitation, care when cleaning areas previously inhabited by rats, spraying for fleas, and other useful, relevant ways to protect yourself. Now, far be it from me to tell you NOT to wash your cans before you drink from them. But isn't that a no-brainer anyway? Haven't we all been taught not to put dirty things into our mouths?
  What would your mother say?

"Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/ss/Smoking-Bed-Bugs-to-Get-High.htm","FAKE NEWS: Kids Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High","2014-04-12 14:02:34","  Description: Viral video / Hoax Circulating since: April 2014 Status: Fake / False
  Analysis: What's all the fuss about? A strangely popular viral video titled ' Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High .'
  The video begins with a voice-over narration: 'It's a new way to get high, and it's called bed bugs.' (Pause.) 'That's because it is bed bugs.'
  Then an alleged user describes what a bed bug high is like: 'It made me just feel, you know, like I was walking through wet concrete.'
  Then it's explained how this shocking new 'teen drug' achieves its intoxicating effects: 'Bed bugs have a known hallucinogen that if smoked or injected can cause major hallucinations. There's no way to extract that active chemical, known as PH-417, so the entire bug is dried, crushed, and then smoked. And sometimes even injected.'
  Except none of it is true.
  The video is a prank, a homemade mash-up assembled from existing news footage with a real-sounding — but fictitious — narration. Bed bugs are not, in fact, hallucinogenic. While the miniscule insects do produce tiny amounts of certain volatile chemicals associated with mating activities which give them their distinct, 'bed buggy' odor, their bodies contain no such substance as 'PH-417,' and there's no way you can get high by smoking them.
  'Smoking Bed Bugs to Get High' is an amusing spoof of those 'scary new drugs teenagers are doing' exposés so beloved by the mainstream media. As best I can determine, the video was first uploaded to LiveLeak.com on April 7, 2014 by a user named John Cain, whose profile states, 'All of the videos that I post are mine and made by me.'
  We will take him at his word, and now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
  Update: John Cain confirmed making the video in a blog post dated April 7, 2014.
  Update: 'Smoking Bedbugs' Hoax Video Uses Footage From Bogus Dabbing Report - Phoenix New Times reports that the original ABC 15 news segment from which the bed bugs hoax video was assembled had fact-checking issues of its own. Shane Watson, misleading interview footage of whom is seen in both videos, has released a clarifying statement .

  Another reason they do it is to scare each other, and to that end some folks aren't above fudging the facts. It's one reason rumors and legends change over time (note the passages highlighted in bold in the examples above), a defining feature of urban legends.
  That a report contains errors or inconsistencies doesn't mean we have to dismiss it as entirely false, however. For example, it's plausible that someone could have died in the manner described above, even if the precise details given us are questionable. It's plainly false that rat urine is inherently 'toxic and obviously lethal' as claimed, but rats do sometimes carry diseases deadly to humans, in which cases their urine and/or feces pose a real epidemiological threat.
  It goes without saying that crates of canned soft drinks could be exposed to rodent traffic during transport and storage, but we needn't conclude that urine contamination is extremely common. Such products are usually boxed and/or shrink-wrapped for transportation and storage until they're put on display for sale.
  If the very idea of drinking from a dirty soda can makes you nervous, by all means do wash the lid before use. A timeless adage that pairs well with any cautionary tale is the old saying, ''Tis better to be safe than sorry.'
  'Tis true!

  Synopsis: Man arrives at hospital with scrotum swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit. The doctors examining him find he has one testicle missing and a gaping wound that appears to be held together by staples. Then he tells them his story...
  Description: Viral story Circulating since: 1991 Status: True
  Example:
  When a 40-year old man arrived at a hospital asking to see a doctor specializing in 'men's troubles', he was shown to a cubicle. There, he gingerly unwrapped three yards of foul smelling, stained gauze from around his scrotum, which had swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit.
  On further inspection, it was discovered that his left testicle was missing completely and, embedded within the swollen, tender and weeping wound, were a number of dark objects which the patient confessed were one inch staple nails from an industrial staple gun.
  It transpired that the man spent lunchtimes alone in the workshop, where he regularly enjoyed the sexual thrill of placing his penis on the moving canvas fan belt of a piece of machinery. One day, the excitement had caused him to lose his concentration and the fan-belt had snatched his scrotum into the fly-wheel, throwing him several feet across the floor and removing his left testicle. Rather than go to hospital, he self-administered first aid using a staple gun and then continued work when his colleagues returned. It was two weeks before he got around to visiting the hospital.

  Analysis: It's tempting to dismiss this grisly story as a prurient joke, but we have it on good authority — that of attending physician Dr. William A.

  Synopsis: Man arrives at hospital with scrotum swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit. The doctors examining him find he has one testicle missing and a gaping wound that appears to be held together by staples. Then he tells them his story...
  Description: Viral story Circulating since: 1991 Status: True
  Example:
  When a 40-year old man arrived at a hospital asking to see a doctor specializing in 'men's troubles', he was shown to a cubicle. There, he gingerly unwrapped three yards of foul smelling, stained gauze from around his scrotum, which had swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit.
  On further inspection, it was discovered that his left testicle was missing completely and, embedded within the swollen, tender and weeping wound, were a number of dark objects which the patient confessed were one inch staple nails from an industrial staple gun.
  It transpired that the man spent lunchtimes alone in the workshop, where he regularly enjoyed the sexual thrill of placing his penis on the moving canvas fan belt of a piece of machinery. One day, the excitement had caused him to lose his concentration and the fan-belt had snatched his scrotum into the fly-wheel, throwing him several feet across the floor and removing his left testicle. Rather than go to hospital, he self-administered first aid using a staple gun and then continued work when his colleagues returned. It was two weeks before he got around to visiting the hospital.

  Analysis: It's tempting to dismiss this grisly story as a prurient joke, but we have it on good authority — that of attending physician Dr. William A. Morton, Jr., who penned a now-famous journal article on the case in 1991 — that the incident really happened. David Herzog, a reporter for the Allentown Morning Call , confirmed the details of the case with Morton in 1992.

  Subject:    FW: SHAMPOO ALERT!!!  MUST READ!!! Importance: High
  Check the ingredients listed on your shampoo bottle, and see  if they
have this substance by the name of Sodium Laureth Sulfate or simply
SLS.
  This substance is found in most shampoo, the manufactures use it
because it produces a lot of foam and it is cheap.  BUT the fact is
that SLS is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very strong.
  It is also proven that it can cause cancer in the long run, and this
is no joke.  Well, I went home and check my shampoo (Vidal Sasoon), it
hasn't got it, but others such as Vo5, Palmolive etc..they've got this
substance, so I've called up to one of the company (u must think I had
nothing better to do, no, I am just concerned about our health) well,
I told them their product contains a substance that will cause people
to have cancer, and u know what they said, they said 'Yeah.we knew
about it but there is nothing we can do about it coz we need that
substance to produce foam, oh, by the way the Colgate toothpaste also
contains the same substance to produce the bubbles'. Oh my God, I've
been using the Colgate since when I was born, what the world is that,
are we going to die very soon. They said they are going to send me
some info.
  Research  have shown that in the 1980s, the chance of getting cancer
is 1 out of 8000 and now  in the 1990s, the chances of getting cancer
is 1 out of 3 which is very serious.  So I hope that you will take
this seriousness and pass on this to all the people you know, and
hopefully, we can stop 'giving' ourselves the cancer virus.
  This is
serious, after you have read this, pass it on to as many people as
possible, this is not a chain letter, but it concerns our health.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  My husband said he heard a report on the news about a man who had a headache and balance problems. When he went to the doctor, surgery was performed and they found a snail had eaten part of his brain. I say balderdash.
  Dear Reader:
  Interesting, considering that most snails eat only vegetable matter (no insult to the victim intended).
  The story is balderdash indeed. It did happen to run as a 'news item' some years ago, but consider the source : that font of journalistic integrity, the Weekly World News . Other hot scoops the supermarket tabloid has published in recent years include 'Robot Crab Crushes Woman!' and 'Giant Whirlpool Is Sucking Ships Right Off the Face of the Earth!' Draw your own conclusion.
  Mind you, medical experts do say you can end up with parasites in your brain by eating snails  raw snails, specifically. There is a parasitic worm known as Angiostrongylus cantonensis whose larvae live in molluscs, including snails and slugs.

"Snakes Kill Child in Burger King Ball Pit","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blsnakes.htm","Snakes in the Ball Pit","2016-03-27 14:17:42","  Description: Email hoax / Urban legend Circulating since: 1998 Status: False
  Email example contributed by Robert Dean, October 1998:
  This is a true story...
  About a week or so ago, a mother took her eager 3 year old son to Burger King for lunch. After they ate their lunch the mother said that the son could go and play on the playground for awhile since he ate all his lunch.
  She watched as the boy played in the tunnels, slide and in the ball-pit. The boy played for about 10 minutes when he started to whimper slightly.
  The mother asks the boy what had happened and he mearly replied, 'Hurt mommy.' The mother assumed that the little boy had banged his elbow or something while playing.
  They left to return home. A half and hour after they were home, the mother noticed some big red welts on the little boys arms and legs. Not being able to figure out what they were, the mother started to look at them closer. Could be red ant bites...she did not know.
  An hour later, the little boy died. Come to find out, when returning to Burger King to see if there were red ants in the play area, in case the little boy had an allergic reaction. Burger King employees and herself discovered that there was a family of baby rattlesnakes living underneath the balls in the ball-pit area. She has since found out that this happens more frequently than not. The snakes will crawl into the ball pit because it is dark and warm in there. She knows for a fact that another death has occurred because of this in South Carolina. Please use caution when letting any children play in an outside play area of a fast food restaurant, this could happen anywhere. Burger Kings are now building their play area's inside the buildings for a safer environment.
  Analysis: This is an updated version of a time-worn urban legend folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand calls 'Death in the Funhouse.' Older variants were typically set in amusement parks, where horror stories of 'razor blades in the water slide' or 'snakes in the merry-go-round' have long been de rigueur .
  Consider Brunvand's 1989 description of the classic snake infestation legend (from Curses! Broiled Again! ):
  The Burger King playground version follows the classic form to the letter, with the additional (and highly effective) element of being framed as a warning to parents. Certain lines give it away as a work of fiction: 'She has since found out that this happens more frequently than not'  which, if true, would mean, literally, that the majority of Burger King ball pits are known to be infested with baby rattlesnakes. Then: 'She knows for a fact that another death has occurred because of this in South Carolina,' which would mean, if true, that two children have died in this manner without the press taking note (or a high-profile lawsuit being filed). The latter, especially, ought to raise eyebrows in this litigious day and age.
  In a statement dated Oct. 23, 1998, the Burger King Corporation categorically denied that incidents of the kind described above have occurred at any of its restaurants.
  Update: A variant appeared in November 1999 claiming that a child died after encountering a heroin-laced hypodermic needle in a McDonald's ball pit. See ' Needle in the Ball Pit .'

"Sour Spray Candy Warning","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_sour_spray_candy.htm","Sour Spray Candy Warning","2016-02-07 14:47:32","  Email example contributed by a reader, 30 May 2006:
  We had a very scary incident with Kylin Saturday night all because of some candy.  It's a liquid that's sour and you just spray it into your mouth.  I was right by Kylin and her friend and heard them say that it would be fun to see what it would taste like if the drank some instead of just sprayed it.  (you know, typical kid fun stuff, I thought nothing of it) So Kylin said she'd try it and took the lid off (it's just like a pump style hair spray top) and she took one sip.  I turned around to ask if she was ok cause I thought she was making noises like when water or something just doesn't go down right and realized that she was just gasping over and over again for air and wasn't actually breathing.  She was having a laryngospasm!
  The definition of what happened is this -
  laryngospasm
  The sudden acute spasm of the vocal cords (and epiglottis ) that can result in occlusion of the airway and death .
  This medical definition above is from http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Home&query=
  Anyway, Kylin's airways did close and she couldn't breath, so we had to call 911.  She threw up before the ambulance got here and she did start being able to breath after that but still had difficulties for a little bit.  The paramedics recommended we take her to the urgent care unit here and get her checked out just to be sure cause she continued to have weird spasms that were causing her throat to make a weird noise for about 2 hours after that.  The doctor there is who told me what actually happened.  She is ok now, thank God, but it was so super scary!!
  Kylin and Daegen both have had sour spray candy before (not sure if they've had this kind though, I've seen a few different kinds) and this has never happened but it did this time.
  I'm attaching a picture of the spray (like I said, there's lots of different variations out there) and am hoping that it will get forwarded and passed around so that hopefully no child or parent has to ever go through this again.
  We are just so lucky that Kylin did start breathing again and is ok now.
  I have been in contact with a lady from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and she came to take a look at it this morning and she took some pictures of it and then was on her way to the convenience store to buy some so they could further investigate in.  I have also contacted Global news and they may do a story about it, I'm waiting to hear back from them while they are researching it a bit.
  Here is the spray that caused this.  It says 'sour' at the top and then 'Big Mouth candy spray' and it does come in different flavors, this one being sour green apple.
  Please pass this on to as many people as you can!!!
  Alicia
  Comments: The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed receiving a report matching the above and issued an advisory dated June 9, 2006  warning that sour spray candy should be consumed only 'as intended'  i.e., sprayed on the tongue, not drunk straight from the bottle.
  Laryngospasm  a sudden, involuntary closure of the larynx  is essentially a drowning reflex that closes off the air supply to the lungs. Children are especially prone to this condition, which can be caused by a foreign body, infection, or allergic reaction. Incidences of laryngospasm have been associated with the accidental aspiration of vinegar, which suggests that other highly acidic liquids may also be apt to trigger it.
  From the CFIA advisory:
  The CFIA has received a report of a child who experienced throat spasms after drinking sour spray candy directly from the container.
  While sour spray candy is safe for children to consume as intended, children should be cautioned against opening the container or trying to drink the product.

  Email example contributed by James P., March 10, 2004:
  REMEMBING THREE SIMPLE TESTS COULD BE A LIFE SAVER !!
  Is It a Stroke?
  This was published in a monthly newsletter where a friend of mine lives and he sent it on. I had never heard this advice before and hadn't a clue. Perhaps you hadn't either and would like to file it away in the back of your head.
  Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke. Now doctors say any bystander can recognize a stroke asking three simple questions:
  * ask the individual to smile. * ask him or her to raise both arms. * ask the person to speak a simple sentence.
  If he or she has trouble with any of these tasks, call 9-1-1 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.
  After discovering that a group of nonmedical volunteers could identify facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems, researchers urged the general public to learn the three questions.
  They presented their conclusions at the American Stroke Association's annual meeting last February. Widespread use of this test could result in prompt diagnosis and treatment of the stroke and prevent brain damage.'
  PASS IT ON...............
  Analysis: Though it's of unknown origin, the above text captures the essence of a scientific study discussed at the 28th International Stroke Conference in February 2003. The study was summarized in a press release as follows:

  Description: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: Aug. 2009 Status: Partly true / Misattributed
  Example: Email contributed by Griff, Oct. 8, 2009:
  Analysis: I contacted the doctor most often cited as the author of this text, Dr. Vinay Goyal , MBBS, MD, DM, Associate Professor of Neurology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and he replied that he did not write it.
  The article has also been falsely attributed to a Dr. Subhash Mehta of Bangalore, and more recently to American TV host Dr. Mehmet Oz (compare the above to Dr. Oz's actual swine flu prevention tips published online).
  Given that the message originally circulated unsigned as early as mid-August 2009, (examples: #1 , #2 ), it seems safe to say that these various attributions were added after the fact in an effort to boost its credibility.
  While some of the tips listed above are uncontroversial and match the recommendations of authoritative sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization , others are less widely accepted and subject to disagreement among medical professionals.
  Let's take them one by one.
  1. Frequent hand-washing
  Recommended by the CDC: 'Sometimes people may become infected by touching something — such as a surface or object — with flu viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose.
  . . Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.' ( Source )
  2. 'Hands-off-the-face' approach
  Recommended by the CDC: 'Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.' ( Source )
  3. Gargle twice a day with warm salt water
  NOT among the recommendations issued by the CDC or WHO. Some individual doctors support the notion that gargling helps prevent the flu, others don't.
  4. Clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water
  This is not among the recommendations issued by the CDC or WHO, though some individual doctors do support the practice.
  5. Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C
  This is not among the recommendations issued by the CDC or WHO. Though research suggests that vitamin C indeed plays a role in bolstering the immune system and protecting against disease, there's disagreement within the medical community as to the value of loading up on specific nutrients versus maintaining an overall nutritious, well-balanced diet to fight colds and flu.
  Dr. Gaurov Dayal, Chief Medical Officer for Adventist Health Care, Bethesda, MD, sums the prevailing view: 'Loading up on Vitamin C will help. That being said, does one specific vitamin prevent H1N1? I don't think that's been proven and again, I would stress that people should have a balanced meal, but not really specifically go for one vitamin over the other.' ( Source )
  6. Drink as much of warm liquids (tea, coffee, etc) as you can
  This is not among the recommendations issued by the CDC or WHO. Again, there is disagreement among medical professionals as to how valuable this practice is in preventing influenza.

"The World's First Male Pregnancy","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/male_pregnancy.htm","The World's First Male Pregnancy","2010-01-08 21:00:17","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  I was pointed to the website www.malepregnancy.com and there is quite a story there. Evidently they are claiming this Mr. Lee is actually pregnant. There are biomedical facts and statistics, live video and photos as well as an interview.
  Is this legit?
  Dear Reader:
  Legit? I think not. We don't even know who the father is.
  The more relevant question is: Is it art? Because that's the spirit in which this elaborate Internet hoax was conceived.
  ' POP! The First Human Male Pregnancy ' purports to follow the medical progress of a Taiwanese man who volunteered to have an embryo implanted in his abdominal cavity. According to the website, the child will be delivered by Caesarean section when it reaches full term (the whole gruesome process is detailed here ).
  If authentic, this would obviously be a true medical first — notwithstanding every 'man gives birth' story we've seen on the covers of supermarket tabloids this past century (e.g., ' Man Gives Birth to a Healthy Baby Boy ' in the July 7, 1992 issue of the Weekly World News ).
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  But it's not true. On the contrary, it's an elaborate put-on conceived by artists Virgil Wong and Lee Mingwei . Both are members of a collective known as 'PaperVeins,' described as 'a multidisciplinary arts group developing work about the human body as seen through medicine, society and technology.'
  GenoChoice , the nonexistent research firm credited with providing the technical know-how to get Mr. Lee knocked up, was also masterminded by Wong (who, online records show, owns both the malepregnancy.com and genochoice.com domain names). 'This is a fictitious web site,' states a disclaimer on the GenoChoice home page, 'created to be an exploration of a very likely scenario that may one day result from new advances in biotechnology and infertility treatments.'
  Moreover, Lee Mingwei's bio attests that he ' ostensibly became the first man to gestate and carry a child in his own body' [emphasis added]. A closer look at the site reveals that the 'streaming videos' and 'live EKG of Mr. Lee,' as well as the 'ultrasound video' of the fetus, are simply animated GIF images. They remain precisely the same from one day to the next.
  So the whole thing is fake. But is it plausible?
  Not very. Some scientists have argued that a male pregnancy is theoretically possible, but in reality the procedure would be so dangerous that the risks would outweigh any possible benefits.
  Essentially what it would require would be inducing an ectopic pregnancy — wherein an embryo is implanted somewhere other than the uterus — in a male subject. In women such pregnancies are considered so hazardous (the number one cause of first-trimester deaths) that they're almost always terminated soon after diagnosis. Even if such a condition could be artificially induced in a male, the subject would run a greater and greater risk of hemorrhaging to death as the pregnancy proceeded.
  So the whole thing is implausible. But is it art?
  Well, sure — if only in the sense that it's an elaborately constructed farce credited to two established conceptual artists. But there's nothing particularly original or groundbreaking here. In a deadpan interview, Lee Mingwei waxes indignant over the fact that historically the idea of a man bearing a child has been considered laughable. It's been the butt of jokes in folklore and popular culture from ancient times because it flies in the face of gender stereotypes in virtually every society, not to mention nature.
  'Now that pregnant men are a reality,' Lee says, tongue planted firmly in cheek, 'no one is laughing anymore!'
  Ah, but they are. Because, in fact, it's the same old joke dressed up as 'art' and represented on a fancy website. Folks are still laughing at the idea of a pregnant man, trust me.

"Waterproof Sunscreen Causes Blindness in Children","http://social.about.com/od/Health/tp/Sunscreen-101-Weve-Got-You-Covered.htm","Sunscreen 101: We've Got You Covered","2015-05-26 21:16:31","  The sun is back, so we are taking advantage of this Sunscreen Day to remind you of the importance of protecting your delicate skin. Apparently 'sunscreen shaming' is now a thing, so take the high road and check out our sunscreen info. Your wrinkle-free face will thank us when you're older.
  If you look back in history, sunscreen is still relatively new, with the first product called Glacier Cream created by Franz Greiter in 1938. A more popular brand followed in 1944, invented by Florida pharmacist Benjamin Green called Red Vet Pet, bought and repackaged by Coppertone in the 1950s.
  More: What Ingredients Are in Sunscreen?
  What does SPF stand for and does the number really matter that much? The lotion or spray contains particles that reflect the sun's bad ultraviolet rays off of your skin.
  Learn more about sunscreen basics here:
  There are so many bottles and lotions and sprays and brands -- how does one decide what is the best to use? Before purchasing, make sure to consider your skin type for sensitivity issues. You should definitely use a different sunscreen for your face from the rest of your body. Sometimes it doesn't matter how expensive a sunscreen is, as long as it gets the job done.

  There is nothing softer than a baby's skin. And what we wouldn't give for the flawless skin of our youth! Protecting your child's skin from overexposure should be a top priority when spending time outside. Help them to develop good sun habits as a child, and they'll hopefully keep them the rest of their lives.
  Help protect that precious cargo:
  There are a lot of misconceptions about sunscreen in the general public. Before we knew about the dangers of skin cancer, people actually used oil to brown up with no protection whatsoever. Nowadays we are more informed to make better decisions regarding skin care.
  However there are still some pertinent questions that many may not know the answers to:

"Zicam Cold Remedy Warning","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_zicam_anosmia.htm","Zicam Cold Remedy Warning","2015-06-12 03:32:30","  Description: Email rumor Circulating since: Sep. 2006 Status: (UPDATED) FDA has issued a consumer warning
  Email example contributed by Diane B., Sep. 26, 2006:
  I need to warn you about a product on the market and hopefully you will pass it on to as many people as possible. I felt like I was coming down with a cold last Friday and because I'm around sick family members so much I wanted possibly head it off. I used Zicam, which is a gel nose spray which claims to keep a cold from becoming 'full blown.' Immediately I had an intense, horrible burning in my nasal/sinus passages. The skin on my face hurt to touch and I had pain and burning so that it hurt to move my head. My husband was here and kept asking if I wanted to go to the ER but the thought of getting in a car was overwhelming. My face was burning hot and my nasal passages were so swollen that I couldn't breathe through my nose and I could see the swelling when I looked in the mirror. It lasted for about three hours and it was Labor Day weekend and I couldn't see a Dr. until Tuesday. I have seen two ENT specialists in the last two days because I have lost, totally lost all ability to taste or smell. They both told me the same thing and suggested an immediate course of action. This is called 'chemical trauma' and most times is permanent. I'm going to have a CT scan on Monday and am on a high dose of the steroid, Prednisone for two weeks. If there is even a thread of the olfactory nerve left, it will help to rejuvenate what is left. I have been on the Internet (just put in Zicam) and there are hundreds of people who have had this happen. I am so angry and devastated and saddened right now that I don't know how to get through this. I cannot handle the thought of never tasting food again or trying a new recipe or smelling a Thanksgiving turkey. Cooking has been an absolute passion of mine for as long as I can remember and at the moment I don't see the point of even putting dressing on a salad. I keep thinking that this cannot be happening to me. I suck on a lemon, bite down on a clove of garlic, smell a bottle of ammonia, nail polish remover, anything. I'm starting by tellling people I love. PLEASE don't use Zicam, tell your friends.
  2009 Update: Responding to more than 130 consumer complaints citing a loss of the sense of smell after using Zicam zinc-based intranasal cold remedies, on June 16, 2009 the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ordered Matrixx Initiatives to stop selling the products without approval. The FDA also warned consumers to stop using the products. 'We are concerned that consumers may unknowingly use a product that could cause serious harm,' said FDA spokesperson Janet Woodcock, 'and therefore we are advising them not to use these products for any reason.” Read more...
