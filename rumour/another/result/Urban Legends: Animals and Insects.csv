"Is This How Big Rattlesnakes Get in Texas?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/snakes/fl/The-Biggest-Rattlesnake-in-Texas.htm","The Biggest Rattlesnake in Texas","2015-09-30 14:53:57","  By David Emery
  Synopsis: Found circulating via forwarded email, here is a viral image of what appears to be a giant rattlesnake killed in Texas, allegedly measuring 9 feet, 1 inch in length and weighing 97 pounds.
  Description: Viral image Circulating since: 2005 Status: Unknown
  Example:
  Fw: 'BIG' Texas Rattle Snake Next time you're out in the tall grass, remember this one. This snake was recently found at the J & S Quik Mart located just south of RR 3014 Turnoff on Highway 281 south of Tow, Texas. [That's just west of Burnett, Texas]
  9 feet, 1 inch - 97 lbs. A reminder that these creatures are actually out there and no matter what you believe, sometimes they should get not only prescriptive rights to be there, but the full right of way. And here's how to cook 'em ... DEEP-FRIED RATTLESNAKE 1 medium-sized rattlesnake (3-4 lbs.), cut into steaks 1/2 cup flour 1/4 cup cornmeal 1/4 cup cracker crumbs 1/2 cup milk 1 egg 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (not garlic salt) 1 teaspoon salt dash pepper Mix dry ingredients. Whisk milk into beaten egg and use to dip snake steaks. Then coat them with dry ingredients. Fry, uncovered, in 400 degree oil until brown. Yum,Yum!

  Analysis: Probably — no, surely — a bit of a tall tale. Another version of this same message circulating since 2005 claims the photo above was taken near Fritch, Texas. Yet another version, making the rounds since 2006, says it was taken near Devil's Lake, North Dakota.
  It's a forwarded email. People make this stuff up as they go.
  The reptile in question appears to be a western diamondback rattlesnake ( Crotalus atrox ), which is native to Texas (but not North Dakota) and is popularly known as the 'Texas rattler.' It's venomous and dangerous. You wouldn't want to try to pick one of these up unless it's dead.
  The image itself doesn't appear to have been manipulated, but perspective plays a giant role in the apparent size of the snake. Note how the specimen is being dangled on the edge of a rod. Note how much closer the snake is to the camera lens than the human subject. This causes its relative size to be exaggerated. Either that, or the human in the photo is very tiny little man. Perhaps it's both.
  Let's talk size. A normal snake of this type is usually around 4 feet long. Though the largest specimens of the western diamondback can grow to 6 or 7 feet in length, the size of this one has obviously been exaggerated at '9 feet, 1 inch.' (If true, it would have been the largest western diamondback rattlesnake ever documented.) Texas is full of giant snake stories .
  As to the recipe, I haven't tried it, but it looks to be a pretty good one. People do cook and eat rattlesnakes in some places. Usually the meat is floured or battered and deep-fried, as in the recipe above, but you can also bake it with rosemary and mushrooms if you prefer.
  The main thing to remember if you're cooking rattlesnake is to skin the dang thing first. Otherwise, you're likely to break a tooth.

  The word ' calico ' aptly describes the coloring of this handsome animal, though ' piebald ' is more often used.
  Piebald deer are white-tailed deer with a genetic defect resulting in a coat with asymmetrical white and brown (or white and black) patches. Experts say the anomaly is quite rare.
  Though piebald deer can presumably be found anywhere white-tailed deer are common — including Wisconsin, where the specimen in the photographs was allegedly killed — it so happens that this deer was actually bagged in east Texas.
  According to the deer hunting and management website Buck Manager , the 195-pound buck was 'harvested' on Nov. 2, 2008 (EXIF data embedded in the images confirms the photos were taken on that date) near Palestine, Texas by James Curtis of Belleville, Texas.
  Among the falsehoods one finds in the various captions accompanying these photos on the Internet are the claims that the deer was killed in Michigan, Arkansas, West Virginia, or Georgia, and that the carcass was sold to hunting outfitter Cabela's for $13,000.

  Example: Email contributed by L Holmes, March 26, 2003:
  FW: Piper's Frog in Kroger peas
  For those of you that haven't already heard from me personally here is a little story about Kroger (Dillons) brand canned peas. Trust me, it is NO JOKE.
  On 3-12 I heated up a can of Kroger peas in the microwave that I had purchased from Dillons at Central and Maize. After eating about half the bowl I noticed something a little darker mixed in with my peas. After one more spoonful of peas IT APPEARED. A FROG!!! After doing a double-triple take I spit my peas out all over the counter and ran to the kitchen sink and lost it. Grossed out beyond belief I poured a big glass of wine and chugged it. Apparently wine and frog laced peas don't go well together because I went back to the sink and lost it again.
  I called Kroger and they gave me the standard were sorry story and blamed their supplier, Lakeside Foods. They had me Fed Ex the frog to Lakeside foods for frog analysis or something.
  HERE IS THE INTERESTING PART. To my amazement/ horror the Kroger representative said I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THIS WAS HAPPENING TO. Yes, there could me more Kroger frogs out there!
  After a about a week they determine that there was indeed a frog in my peas. When I asked how they were going to resolve the situation they offered me a $100 Kroger gift card. I was pretty offended. I haven't been able to eat any vegetable since that day let alone look at a can of peas.
  So this doesn't happen to anyone else I am attaching the pictures of my little friend and the can he came in. Lakeside Foods also supplies canned vegetables to the Fleming Company. Fleming supplies the Wichita Checkers and Boogarts stores. Anyone want the 10 other cans of Kroger vegetables I still have in my cabinet?
  Pea sickened for life,
  Bryan Piper
  Analysis: 'It did happen,' a Kroger representative told me when I recited Bryan Piper's horror story to him over the customer service hotline. 'These things can happen, but it's not a very common occurrence. We take the strictest precautions to prevent it.'
  In this case, he explained, the wayward frog evidently rolled itself into a tiny ball the size and shape of a pea, thus escaping detection during the automated sorting process.
  Come to find out, this is a fairly well-known phenomenon in the vegetable packing industry.
  He wasn't able to confirm or deny Piper's account of how the company handled his complaint, though according to news coverage by KAKE-TV in Wichita, Piper received a letter of apology from Kroger even though an independent cannery was actually to blame. A spokesman for the cannery confirmed the slip-up and admitted it was not an isolated incident, though oversights of this kind are generally rare, he said. The company claims it has spent millions of dollars on equipment expressly designed to prevent such occurrences.
  We're accustomed, of course, to finding out upon investigation that dreadful contamination stories of this ilk are false or, at best, impossible to confirm (e.g., ' The McPus Sandwich ,' ' McChickenhead ,' ' Cockroach Egg Tacos ,' ' Kentucky Fried Rat ,' etc.), thus it's well to be reminded that such incidents really do occur. Every true report lends credence to a host of similar-sounding urban legends, which helps explain why these larger-than-life tales remain popular, indeed comprising their own unique genre of contemporary folklore.
  It's not, as cynics might claim, because the general public is naive and gullible, but because the stories reflect, albeit in exaggerated form, people's genuine, valid concerns about their own safety and well-being as consumers of a mass-produced, depersonalized food supply.
  In recognition of this, it is often said that even the most outlandish urban legends contain at least a small grain of truth. Some, we are now compelled to add, contain an entire legume's worth.

"What Happens If You Don't Press 'Clear' After Paying at the Gas Pump?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/business/a/clear_button.htm","Do You Need to Press the 'Clear' Button After Paying at the Gas Pump?","2008-07-21 22:26:04","  By David Emery
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: May 2008 Status: False
  Summary: Viral message advises service station customers to press the 'clear' button after using a debit or credit card at the gas pump so subsequent users won't be able to 'piggyback' charges on their accounts.
  Example #1: Email contributed by Yvonne H., June 2, 2008:
  Fwd: FW: Be sure to hit the 'CLEAR' Button
  This may be helpful to all!
  This has happened to me but it was more extreme. I was at the Cowboys/Kangaroo gas station on Tallapoosa . My account was hit inaccess of 24 times @ $45.00 a pop! Needless to say I haven't been there since then. My bank shut down my account and another account had to be opened.
  Jim just told me about something that happened to one of his coworkers. She used her credit/debit card to purchase gas at the pump (like most of us do). She received her receipt like normal. However, when she checked her statement, there were 2 $50 charges added in addition to her purchase. Upon investigation, she found out that because she did not press the 'clear' button on the pump, the employee inside the store was able to use her card to purchase his/her own gas! To keep this from happening, after you get your receipt, you must press the 'CLEAR' button or your information will be stored until the next customer inserts their card. Be sure to tell all your friends/family so that this doesn't happen to them!

  Officer Dave Gilman Crime Prevention Officer Colorado Springs Police Department Stetson Hills Division 719-444-3168
  Analysis: If this were true, you'd be hearing alerts about it on the evening news or in your daily newspaper, not finding out about it in an internet meme .
  What's more, these devices —' pay-at-the-pump card readers — get so much use that if credit card 'piggybacking' were really as easy as described above, gas station customers would be doing it, accidentally or not, all the time . And there would be a deafening public outcry about it, not a viral whimper.
  The card processing equipment on modern gas pumps works the same as that found at ATMs and grocery store check-out stands. Once the charge has gone through, the transaction is complete. Period. The next customer's purchase can't end up on your credit or debit card.
  Colorado Springs police officer Dave Gilman, whose signature line appears at the bottom of one variant of the message, admits sending the message but told KRDO-TV News that the information is incomplete. 'The first couple of lines were telling people that those pumps are very rare and hard to find,' he said. A company that manufactures the equipment explained that such a thing could have happened with 'first-generation models,' but few people nowadays could expect to encounter the outdated machines.
  The clear button exists for a reason, however. Waite Park, Minnesota community service officer Alicia Mages, says customers should make use of it if they swipe their cards then change their minds about pumping gas. 'In checking with a local station,” she told Newsleaders.com, 'they indicated your card information clears after you fill your vehicle. However, if you put your card in and decide to use a different pump, or leave the station, you do need to press clear or cancel to clear your information out of the pump.'

"Elephants: What Makes Them So Unique?","http://ecology.about.com/od/Ecology/fl/Elephants-What-Do-They-Eat-Where-Do-They-Live-and-What-Makes-Them-Special.htm","Elephants: What Do They Eat, Where Do They Live and What Makes Them Special?","2015-06-05 21:12:52","  By Jenn Savedge
  Elephants once roamed over large swaths of Africa and Asia. But they were almost wiped completely off of the map by the aggressive ivory trade of the early 20th century. Fortunately, international regulations were put in place at the latter part of that century to protect these gentle giants, and there populations - while still diminished - are finally beginning to recover.
  Elephants are massive mammals. They can reach a height of 13 feet and a weight of 15,000 pounds. In general, there are two recognized subspecies of elephants - the African elephant and the Asian elephant, with the greatest difference between the two being their physical location. African elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan Africa while Asian elephants are found in southern and southeastern Asia.
  These massive creatures are known for their thick bodies, stocky legs, giant floppy ears, trunks, and tusks. Those big ears help elephants stay cool in hot, dry conditions.

  And their trunks serve as a fifth limb which they use to breathe, grasp objects, lift water, and even suckle for comfort .
  Another big difference between Asian and African elephants is their tusks. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, unlike Asian elephants in which only the males have tusks - and not even all males. It is the elephant's tusks -made of ivory- that are so valuable to poachers.
  Asian elephants are also smaller than their African peers, and their ears have straight edges at the bottoms unlike the fan-like shape of African elephant ears. Another key difference? Asian elephants have four toes on their hind feet and five on the forefeet, while African elephants have three on their hind feet and five on the forefeet.
  Elephants are herbivores that live in many different types of habitat from savannah to marsh to forest. They are considered keystone species due to their impact on the environment in which they live. They are very social animals that live together in large groups , usually comprised of several female elephants - called cows - and their babies - or calves. Often these groups are made up from females and baby elephants from several different families. These elephants are led by a matriarch - typically the oldest female in the group. Male elephants - called bulls - usually leave the group once they reach puberty and may live alone or with other bulls.
  Elephants have the longest known pregnancy of any living mammal . Elephant mothers carry their babies for 22 months in the womb and then care for their babies for several years after birth.
  One topic that has been the subject of lots of research regarding elephants is their methods of communication. Elephants have been known to communicate via touch, sight, smell, and sound. Over long distances, they can use seismic communication - or vibrations made by stomping their feet - to communicate dangers to other members of the herd.
  Elephants are prey animals that are hunted by top predators such as lions, tigers, and hyenas. But usually, these animals only go after the very young or the very old. The elephant's greatest threat is humankind. Both African and Asian elephants were hunted nearly to extinction before a ban on ivory trade was enacted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1989. Asian elephants are still classified as endangered , while African elephants are considered vulnerable.
  Habitat loss is another threat that faces the existence of elephants. Human-elephant conflicts have increased over the years as humans have encroached more and more upon elephant habitat and migratory routes.

"Holy Crab! Can Coconut Crabs Really Get That Big?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fish/ss/coconut_crab.htm","Giant Coconut Crab","2009-03-11 16:53:10","  Description: Viral images Circulating since: 2007 Status: Authentic (details on next page)
  Example: Email text contributed by Dallas B., Feb. 6, 2009:
  Analysis: Of the preceding pair of images, the one above has been authenticated (it appears in the photostream of a Flickr user named 'BlueBec') but the other , while presumably just as authentic, has yet to be sourced. The EXIF data embedded in the first image indicates the photo was taken on April 4, 2007 with an Olympus digital camera and that it was not subsequently edited. In short, these scary-looking beasts are real.
  Coconut crabs (also known as 'robber crabs,' and by the scientific name Birgus latro) are related to hermit crabs and typically grow to about 16 inches in length, pincer to pincer, though there have been anecdotal reports of specimens double that size. In any case, it is the world's largest species of land crab and reputedly lives as long as 50 years. An inhabitant of islands throughout the Indian and central Pacific oceans, the coconut crab tends to stick close to beaches, though it can't live in water (in fact, it will drown if submerged for too long a period of time). True to both of its common names, the omnivorous crustacean's preferred food source is the white flesh of fallen coconuts, though it will fall back on whatever sustenance is at hand, including such delicacies as might be scavenged from a garbage can (as in the first image).
  Reportedly , coconut crabs have even been known to feast on small animals (chickens, kittens, their fellow crabs, etc.), and a theory has even been floated that the body of lost-at-sea pilot Amelia Earhart was consumed by coconut crabs, and that's why her remains have never been found.
  Unfortunately for them, coconut crabs themselves are a sought-after food source for humans, hence their populations have dwindled wherever their habitat has been encroached upon by Homo sapiens. It's inadvisable to hunt them for food unless you know what you're doing, however, because their pincers are very large, very powerful, and can cause significant pain. Fair warning!

  Was an 1,800-pound feral hog killed in Texas? No. The images ( #1 , #2 , #3 ) are mislabeled.
  The earliest version of the caption, dated March 2009, claimed the monster boar was bagged in Texas. An August 2011 version said it was shot in Missouri. Yet another version claimed it was killed in Florida. The truth of the matter is that these photos weren't taken anywhere on the North American continent.
  According to a March 3, 2009 article in the Conroe Courier , no 1,800-pound wild boar has ever been seen near Conroe, Texas — let alone hunted, bagged, and photographed for posterity.
  Your average Texan feral hog weighs in at approximately 150 pounds, says a Texas Parks and Wildlife game warden quoted in the Courier . An exceptionally large one might tip the scales at 300. It's rare to find a wild boar exceeding 400 pounds anywhere in the United States.
  In point of fact, it's doubtful there's a wild boar anywhere in the world that weighs 1,800 pounds. There have been reports of domestic hogs approaching or exceeding that size, but the largest documented specimens in the wild have topped out at 1,100 pounds or less.
  Citing a report in a French hunting magazine, the Courier reveals that the boar in these pictures was actually a 781-pounder killed in Turkey in 2005 (the EXIF data embedded in the images confirms the photos were snapped on June 3 of that year). One visual clue — the 'Nature Tours' logo on the side of a vehicle in one of the photos — indeed points to a Turkish hunting website on which the same images are displayed.

"Is This Photo of a Behemoth 'New York Rat' for Real?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/rodents/fl/Photo-of-a-Giant-New-York-Rat.htm","Photo of a Giant 'New York Rat'","2016-02-01 03:20:31","  By David Emery
  Description: Viral image Circulating since: 2009 Status: Misrepresented
  Analysis: This image of a man holding a dead rat the size of a small dog circulated via Facebook in January 2016. The caption read, simply, 'New York rats. And yes it's real.'
  But while the photo may, in fact, be authentic (it appears to be, though I haven't yet been able to nail down its origin), it probably wasn't taken in New York City, it was definitely not taken in 2016 and the pictured rodent is emphatically not a typical 'New York rat.'
  To the contrary, it appears to be a giant Gambian pouched rat , specimens of which can weigh more than 3 pounds and grow to an astounding 18 inches long (excluding tail). They're mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa, though they exist elsewhere, including the Florida Keys, as an invasive species. According to Scientific American , there were unconfirmed reports of very large rats — possibly giant pouched rats — wandering New York City streets after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  By comparison, the ordinary brown rat (aka Norway rat), the type most commonly found in New York City, typically grows no larger than 10 inches long and weighs less than a pound. Even so, rats have been legend fodder for New Yorkers since time immemorial.
  It used to be commonly said and believed, for example, that rats outnumber people in New York City. No so, according to a statistician who studied the available data and concluded there are probably around 2 million rats living in New York City at any given time, while the human population is around 8 million. As small a comfort as it may seem, that means human outnumber rats by 4 to 1.
  The image has a rather interesting history preceding its January 2016 rediscovery by the Internet:
  The story about a sewer rat mistaken for a chihuahua or other small dog by tourists is another well known rodent urban legend, ' The Mexican Pet .'
  Yet another is the tale of Richard Gere and the Gerbil , which, if true, would give us cause to doubt Mr. Gere's Buddhist credentials — but we have no reason to think it's anything but false.
  An email rumor dating from 2005 purported to prove that a Chinese restaurant in Atlanta was caught cooking and serving rat meat to its unsuspecting customers and forced to close its doors. There were no media reports to back up these accusations.

  This is freaking scary. As you know I was alone when I downed this elk in ND. I was using my camera’s timer attached to my shooting stick to give me enough time to get into the picture. I knew there were a lot of cats in the area but had no idea they would come in this close to people. He had to be within 10 feet of me and I didn’t even know it. I about crapped my pants when I looked at the pictures the next morning and saw he was there.
  Analysis: False. Both the photo and the story are fabrications. If you look closely at the composite image, in which the light on the cougar clearly falls from a different direction than that on the hunter, it's easy to tell it was doctored. It was created by pasting part of a 2008 photograph of a cougar in California taken by self-styled 'Camera Trap Codger' Chris Wemmer into another photo (origin unknown) of an elk hunter posing with his trophy kill.

The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued — and won! In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that the cigars would be insured against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire, it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.
  Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company grudgingly accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in the fires. After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one-year terms.
  So don't piss off your insurance company!

  From The London Times:
  Outside the Bristol Zoo, in England, there is a parking lot for 150 cars and 8 coaches, or buses. It was manned by a very pleasant attendant with a ticket machine charging cars 1 pound (about $1.40) and coaches 5 (about $7). This parking attendant worked there solid for all of 25 years. Then, one day, he just didn't turn up for work.
  'Oh well', said Bristol Zoo Management, 'we'd better phone up the City Council and get them to send a new parking attendant...'
  'Er... no', said the Council, 'that parking lot is your responsibility.'
  'Er... no', said Bristol Zoo management, 'the attendant was employed by the City Council, wasn't he?'
  'Er... NO!' insisted the Council.
  Sitting in his villa somewhere on the coast of Spain, is a bloke who had been taking the parking lot fees, estimated at 400 pounds (about $560) per day at Bristol Zoo for the last 25 years. Assuming 7 days a week, this amounts to just over 3.6 million pounds ($7 million).
  And no one even knows his name.

  JUST WHEN you lost faith in human kindness. . .
  Someone who teaches at a Middle School in Safety Harbor, Florida forwarded the following letter. The letter was sent to the principal's office after the school had sponsored a luncheon for the elderly. An old lady received a new radio at the lunch, and was writing to say thanks:
  God blesses you for the beautiful radio I won at your recent senior citizens luncheon. I am 84 years old and live at the Safety Harbor Assisted Home for the Aged. All of my family has passed away. I am all alone now and it's nice to know that someone is thinking of me. God bless you for your kindness to an old forgotten lady.
  My roommate is 95 and always had her own radio, but before I received one, she would never let me listen to hers, even when she was napping. The other day her radio fell off the night stand and broke into a lot of pieces. It was awful and she was in tears. She asked if she could listen to mine, and I said, 'Fuck you.'
  Life is good.
  Sincerely, Edna

  THESE TWO guys my friend knows work for Chase Bank. Every year they go to Australia for a big, bank-sponsored golf tournament. This past year, these guys and their team won the entire tournament and went on to drink lots of beers and celebrate while wearing their newly-won green tournament jackets.
  After drinking up a storm, they plopped into their rented car and were driving on deserted roads nearby when they accidentally hit a large kangaroo.
  Getting out of the car, they realized that the kangaroo had died in the accident.
  Being so drunk, though, they propped up the kangaroo, its lifeless head bouncing from one side to the other, dressed it in one of their new green jackets, and took pictures of themselves with their arms around it.
  After a few minutes of picture-taking, the guys were shocked when it seemed that the kangaroo came back to life! It turns out that the poor kangaroo wasn't dead, but it had passed out, and when it came back to consciousness started to box with the drunken guys! It actually broke one guy's jaw!! It then hopped away into the landscape.
  The men couldn't drive their rented car, as the keys were in the green jacket, which was still on the kangaroo, so they had to walk back to the tournament. A little while later, a pack of kangaroos was seen in the distance, one of them wearing the green jacket.

  A YOUNG lady has a new, well-to-do boyfriend. He suggests that she come and meet his parents by having dinner at their place. After a pleasant drive into the country he pulls into a long, impressive drive and she is shocked to find that 'their place' is a huge country estate. The door is opened by a butler, who shows the couple in. It's a very impressive, stately home with history, etc.
  Everything goes well as they are given drinks and introduced.
  Being a normal, working class girl, she is a bit awestruck and worried about making a faux pas or breaking some rule of etiquette she is unaware of.
  After several drinks she relaxes and they are shown into the dining room for a large feast. Halfway through dinner, the girl, having drunk a fair bit, needs the loo. In her best, polite manner she asks for 'the bathroom?' and is shown out of the room by a servant and pointed upstairs to a room.
  It's a huge house with many rooms and she finds what she thinks is the right door, only to find a 'bathroom' — i.e., no toilet, just a sink and bath. As she only needs a quick wee, she locks the door, hitches up her skirt and, balancing one leg on the bath, sits on the pedestal sink. Unfortunately, it starts to tip over and she hits her head on the bath and knocked unconscious.
  She is awakened by a commotion as the door is pushed in and her new boyfriend and family burst in to see her, knickers down, skirt raised and soaking wet, with the broken sink on the floor and water pouring everywhere!!!

  THERE WAS a sweet older lady who would often do grocery shopping for the infirm and elderly in her church. One hot, summer day a lady asked her to pick up a few things and bring them by her house in a dangerous part of Baltimore City. The sweet old lady was wary but felt that she couldn't say no, even though she was terrified of driving in the part of the city that often had shoot-outs and other drug violence.
  Anyway, the woman went on her way, picked up the groceries and proceeded to the lady's house.
  As she entered the lady's neighborhood she noticed young hoodlums gathering on every street corner. Although she had no air conditioning in the car, she rolled the windows up tightly (as a safety precaution) and suffered in the 90+ degree heat.
  She drove ahead until suddenly she heard a loud 'POP!' and felt a jolt to the back of her head. She reached to feel the back of her head and came back with a wet oozing mess that she was sure was part of her brain! Knowing that she had been shot, the woman turned around and raced to a local hospital.
  Somehow she made it to the emergency room and had the strength to walk right in. She told the attendant that she had been shot. Immediately she was rushed back to an exam room. Doctors whirled around and asked where she had been shot (since they saw no blood). She said 'my head,' and the doctors found a mass of the oozing white substance the woman had first noticed.
  Upon inspection the doctors realized that the white substance wasn't part of her brain but was instead a lump of biscuit dough (the kind in a can) that had exploded from the heat of her car!

  Subject: Vanilla Pudding
  This is just too funny not to share. Excerpted from an article which appeared in the Dublin Times about a bank robbery on March 2, 1999.
  Once inside the bank shortly after midnight, their efforts at disabling the internal security system got underway immediately.
  The robbers, who expected to find one or two large safes filled with cash and valuables, were surprised to see hundreds of smaller safes scattered throughout the bank.
  The robbers cracked the first safe's combination, and inside they found only a bowl of vanilla pudding.
  As recorded on the bank's audio tape system, one robber said, 'At least we'll have a bit to eat.' The robbers opened up a second safe, and it also contained nothing but vanilla pudding. The process continued until all the safes were opened.
  They found not one pound sterling, a diamond, or an ounce of gold. Instead, all the safes contained covered bowls of pudding.
  Disappointed, the robbers made a quiet exit, each leaving with nothing more than a queasy, uncomfortably full stomach.
  The newspaper headline read:
  'IRELAND'S LARGEST SPERM BANK ROBBED EARLY THIS MORNING.'

  ONE YEAR at Thanksgiving, my mom went to my sister's house for the traditional feast. Knowing how gullible my sister is, my mom decided to play a trick. She told my sister that she needed something from the store. When my sister left, my mom took the turkey out of the oven. She removed the stuffing, stuffed a Cornish hen, inserted it into the turkey, and re-stuffed the turkey. She then placed the bird(s) back in the oven.
  When it was time for dinner, my sister pulled the turkey out of the oven and proceeded to remove the stuffing. When her serving spoon hit something, she reached in and pulled out the little bird.
  With a look of total shock on her face, my mother exclaimed, 'Patricia, You've cooked a pregnant bird!'
  At the reality of this horrifying news, my sister started to cry. It took the family two hours to convince her that turkeys lay eggs!
  Yep, you got it....
  SHE'S BLONDE!

  A HAPPY, hip, happening woman living in San Francisco has to endure a visit from her mother, a prim and proper matronly sort from somewhere in the Midwest. The mother is in the throes of menopause, apparently very cranky and physically uncomfortable, what with hot flashes and the like, and the daughter, in an effort to help but probably also to get Mom out of the house for awhile, suggests that the mother visit her gynecologist.
  Mom is not fond of the idea of visiting a gynecologist in a strange city. But after the daughter assures her that the man is thoughtful, kind, humorous and sweet and implores her to go just to make sure everything is okay, the mother reluctantly assents and makes an appointment.
  The morning of the appointment, mother is VERY nervous and in preparation takes a shower AND a bath, deodorant head to toe, FDS vaginal spray, the whole nine yards, and heads to the gynecologist.
  So. Mom's in the stirrups, the doctor's mucking about down there, and he looks up, fixes her with a funny smile and says, 'Looks like we've got ourselves a PARTY GIRL!!'
  Mother is shocked, to say the least. 'What... what did you say??!!!'
  He grins even wider. 'I said, 'Looks like we've got ourselves a PARTY GIRL!'' and this is accompanied by a smirk and a wink. Mom is flabbergasted and doesn't utter another word for the balance of the exam, hastily dresses and runs out while avoiding his glance.
  Later that evening, the daughter returns home from work, inquires how the appointment went, and the mother says, 'You have a very rude doctor!
  He called me a party girl!'
  'A what?'
  'A party girl!' Mom is sniffling now. 'Why would he call me that?'
  'I don't know, it's very out of character for him...' the daughter puzzles. 'There must be some reason. Think back. Did you say anything, maybe?'
  'No!' The mother bristles. 'I didn't say anything like that!'
  'Come on, think back. What did you do before the appointment?'
  'Well,' the mother sniffs, 'I was VERY conscientious with my hygiene. I took a bath AND a shower, I used your deodorant and FDS — I hope you don't mind — and then I got dressed, and...'
  'Mom!' the daughter interrupts. 'Mom, I don't have any FDS.'
  The mother is silent. They both head to the bathroom where the mother points out what she mistook for FDS. It wasn't. It was orange glitter hair spray from the previous Halloween.
  The moral being: READ THE LABEL!

  FOR ANYONE who feels they've been invited to too many weddings lately, have a laugh. This is actually true. It was in a local newspaper in South Carolina and even Jay Leno mentioned it on The Tonight Show .
  This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.
  After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd.
  He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming, and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.
  To thank everyone for coming, bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So, taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.
  He said that this was his gift and told everyone to open their envelopes.
  Inside each envelope was an 8x10 photo of his best man having sex... with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding.
  After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, 'F--- you!' He turned to his bride and said, 'F--- you!' Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, 'I'm out of here!'
  He had the marriage annulled the first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway, as if nothing was wrong.
  His revenge:
  1) Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guests for a wedding and reception.
  2) Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And, best of all...
  3) Trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends and their entire families.
  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might see one of those MasterCard 'Priceless' commercials out of this? Huh?
  Elegant wedding for 300 family and guests — $32,000 Photographers for the wedding — $3,000 Deluxe Honeymoon accommodations in Maui for 2 weeks — $8,500 The look on everyone's faces after seeing a photo of the Bride and Best Man having sex — PRICELESS!!!

  AT HEATHROW Airport in England, a 300-foot red carpet was stretched out to Air Force One and President Bush strode to a warm but dignified handshake from Queen Elizabeth II. They rode in a silver 1934 Bentley to the edge of central London where they boarded an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificent white horses.
  As they rode toward Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side and waving to the thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all was going well.
  This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry and dignity. Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip the most horrendous, earth-shattering, eye-smarting blast of flatulence, and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes.
  Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that was a ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassing situation. She turned to Mr. Bush and explained, 'Mr. President, please accept my regrets. I'm sure you understand that there are some things even a Queen cannot control.'
  George W., ever the Texas gentleman, replied, 'Your Majesty, please don't give the matter another thought. You know, if you hadn't said something I would have assumed it was one of the horses.'

  THIS IS a bricklayer's accident report, which was printed in the newsletter of the British equivalent of the Workers' Compensation  Board.  This is a true story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure.
  Dear Sir:
  I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put 'Poor planning' as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.
  I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work I found I had some bricks left over, which, when weighed later, were found to be slightly in excess of 500 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.
  Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs.
  Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.  Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed.
  This explains the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form.
  Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.  At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel.  Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight.
  As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the building.  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.  This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body.  Here my luck began to change slightly.  The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks, and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.
  I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.  This explains the two broken legs.
  I hope this answers your inquiry.

  WHEN APOLLO Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' statement but followed it by several remarks, usual com traffic between him, the other astronauts, and Mission Control. Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark, 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.'
  Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut.
  However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the 'Good luck, Mr. Gorsky' statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.
  On July 5, 1995 (in Tampa Bay, FL), while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.
  When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. & Mrs. Gorsky.
  As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, 'Oral sex! You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!'

  A MAN was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his engine on the motorcycle and somehow, the motorcycle slipped into gear. The man, still holding the handlebars, was dragged through a glass patio door and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room, and found her husband laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and the patio door shattered.
  The wife ran to the phone and summoned an ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of long steps to the street to direct the paramedics to her husband.
  After the ambulance arrived and transported the husband to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas had spilled on the floor, the wife obtained some papers towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet. The husband was treated at the hospital and was released to come home.
  After arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while still seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard a loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband laying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin.
  The wife again ran to the phone and called for an ambulance.
  The same ambulance crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them tipped the stretcher and dumped the husband out. He fell down the remaining steps and broke his arm. Now THAT is a bad day...

  A MARRIED couple were invited to a swanky masked Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went.
  The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party.
  In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could and copping a little feel here and a little kiss there.
  His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little bang.
  Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.
  She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had had. He said, 'Oh the same old thing.
  You know I never have a good time when you're not there.'
  Then she asked, 'Did you dance much?'
  He replied, 'I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But I'll tell you... The guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good time!'

  THIS STORY happened a while ago in Dublin, and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, it’s true.
  John Bradford, a Dublin University student, was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a big storm.
  The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly, he saw a car slowly coming towards him and stopped.
  John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got into the car and closed the door... Only to realize there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn’t on. The car started moving slowly. John looked at the road ahead and saw a curve approaching. Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. Then, just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared out of nowhere through the window, and turned the wheel. John, paralyzed with terror, watched as the hand came through the window, but never touched or harmed him.
  Shortly thereafter, John saw the lights of a pub appear down the road, so, gathering strength; he jumped out of the car and ran to it. Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just had.
  A silence enveloped the pub when everybody realized he was crying... And wasn’t drunk.
  Suddenly, the door opened, and two other people walked in from the dark and stormy night. They, like John, were also soaked and out of breath.
  Looking around, and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other...
  Look, Paddy... there’s that idiot that got in the car while we were pushing it!

  FROM THE Sydney Morning Herald comes this story of a central west couple who  drove their car into K-Mart only to have their car break down in the car park. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.
  The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis.
  Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned his private parts into glaringly public ones.
  Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.
  On regaining her feet she looked across the bonnet and found herself staring at her husband standing idly by.
  The mechanic however had to have three stitches in his head.

  Warning!!
  Don't plan on your four legged friends walking around with you on Halloween this year.
  KEEP ALL DOGS IN A LOCKED HOUSE
  October 31 (Halloween Night) is trying to become National 'Kill a Pit Bull Day'
  Not only is Pit Bulls part of this 'Holiday'. Any breed is fair game. Especially, any look alike breeds.
  Terry Jordan - Yesterday I'm here by announcing October 31 National kill a pitbull day. After you take the kids trick or treating keep your costume on round up some friends and kill as many pitbulls as you can before midnight. Baseball bats, knives, bricks and poisons (a hotdog soaked in radiator fluid works well) are all suitable tools. Their owners like brag about there high threshold for pain. So don't worry them suffering they can take it. So remember to spread the word!
  OCTOBER 31, 2012 NATIONAL KILL A PITBULL NIGHT Please feel free to scan to spread the awareness.
  Analysis: This is a hoax. No one has designated October 31st 'National Kill a Pit Bull Day,' nor is anyone seriously calling for violence against pit bulls or any other animals on Halloween .
  The flier reproduced above was created in September 2012 (note the date on the scanned image) by person(s) unknown, evidently as a prank. It quotes a fake text message attributed to Terry Jordan , a Slater, Missouri city councilman who had been instrumental in drafting a vicious animal ordinance the year before, incurring the wrath of local dog owners in the process. Jordan disavowed the fabricated text as soon as it surfaced and issued statements condemning its violent message. 'I am not this person,' he told the Marshall Democrat-News last September. 'I don't want to see anybody hurt dogs or people.'
  We still don't know who was responsible for the original prank.
  Longstanding rumors of an increase in animal abuse on Halloween night — including purported instances of the 'ritual abuse' of black cats by 'Satanists' — have proven to be largely unfounded over the years, but veterinarians and animal advocacy groups still recommend keeping pets indoors for their own safety.

"Don't Believe Anything the Internet Says About This Mountain Lion","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalkingdom/ss/West-Virginia-Mountain-Lion.htm","Is This a West Virginia Mountain Lion?","2016-04-25 04:10:51","  Viral images show an unusually large mountain lion (cougar) purportedly killed near Parkersburg, West Virginia (or elsewhere, such as Altoona, Pennsylvania, Cadiz, Kentucky, and other unlikely locations).
  Description: Viral images Circulating since: February 2008 Status: Mislabeled
  Example: Email contributed by Tina P., March 3, 2008:
  Subject: Massive Mountain Lion (near parkersburg, wv) This lion was hit between Grantsville and Walker WV.. by a car. Game and Fish had to come and put him down. He charged at the Fish and Game guy in the process. Look at his PAWS!
  Analysis: As so often happens with viral images, the preceding photos — which are authentic and date from December 2007 — have attained urban legend status thanks to folks making up stories about them before sharing them with others.
  Here's a version that was forwarded to me in May 2009:
  Cougar bagged Near Beaumont, Texas
  Look at what James Snipe hit with his car on county road 421 north of Beaumont Texas in Jefferson County. The lion was still alive but unable to move, so our neighbor called animal control and they came and put him down. A land owner had seen this one a week before dragging off a 320 lb steer. Our neighbor is an amateur taxidermist and he's going to stuff him.  This one weighed 260 lbs. while most mature male mountain lions weigh 80 to 150 lbs. We had no idea they still roamed around here!
  So, was the mountain lion killed in West Virginia or Texas? The answer is neither.
  The true facts are these. The cougar in question, estimated at 200 to 220 pounds and over 7 feet in length, was run over when it leaped in front of a pickup truck driven by Arizona resident Marshall Rader on Highway 64 between Williams and Valle, Arizona.
  The big cat was still alive but mortally injured when Rader and his wife got out to examine it, so they dialed 911 and waited for someone from the Arizona Department of Public Safety to arrive and put it down. The man posing with the carcass is DPS officer Jason Ellico, who dispatched the animal on the scene and later skinned it as a demonstration for local Boy Scouts.
  Someone — presumably Mr. or Mrs. Rader, though we don't know for sure — emailed the pictures to friends, who emailed them to more friends, and on and on until an urban legend was born . Among the first fabrications appended to the photos was the claim that the accident had occurred in a different part of Arizona — between Prescott and Ash Fork, to be exact, roughly 60 miles or so from the true location.
  By early March 2008, the story had changed yet again such that the cougar was said to have been killed southeast of Parkersburg, West Virginia between Grantsville and Walker. West Virginia game officials were quick to label that version of the message a hoax, noting that the accident had also been falsely reported to have occurred in Arkansas. As time went on, there were versions claiming the cougar was shot near Altoona, Pennsylvania, Cadiz, Kentucky, and other unlikely locations.
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service has concluded that the eastern cougar (aka eastern puma), a subspecies that once roamed northeastern North America, is now extinct. Nonetheless, there have been occasional unconfirmed reports of cougar sightings in states such as West Virginia in recent years, leading biologists to theorize that a few western cougars may have migrated east.
  A series of photos showing a mountain lion creeping around someone's porch in Wyoming met a similar fate as these images, circulating under the pretense of being taken in Michigan, Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere.

  Example caption: As shared on Facebook, April 19, 2013:
  Analysis: This is an actual photograph that has been digitally manipulated — by whom, we don't know — to exaggerate her unusual gold coloring. Zoe the zebra is real, but sans color enhancement her stripes look more beige than golden, and her eyes, though bright blue, don't have the preternatural glow seen above (view original image here , and another here ).
  According to her caretakers at Three Ring Ranch Exotic Animal Sanctuary in Hawaii, Zoe was born with a condition known as amelanosis , a melanin pigment deficiency, and is indeed extremely rare.

  FW: Did you lose a cat? This is probably the most amazing picture of 2011!
  Analysis: The Internet love-love-loves its cute animal photos, and this viral image of a raccoon cradling a kitten in its arms packs a double wallop of adorable.
  If you guessed it was Photoshopped, you're correct.
  Versions of the image have been circulating online since 2007, or thereabouts — sometimes with cat, sometimes not, sometimes with fire extinguisher, sometimes not.
  The earliest version I've found with the cat — because, apparently, a photo of a raccoon begging on its hind legs in a doorway isn't cute enough by itself — was posted in January 2011.

"Elephants and Enemas","http://www.snopes.com/critters/malice/feces.htm","Feces of Death","2011-07-31 03:28:52-0700","  Claim:
  A zookeeper in Paderborn, Germany, was killed when an elephant defecated on him.
  FALSE
  Example:
  [Collected on the Internet, 1998]
  PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Frederic Briefed fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let fly — and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop! Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dump truck full of mud. 'The sheer force of the elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him,' said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. 'With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time he suffocated. 'It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that happen sometimes — a billion-to-one shot, at least.' The heartbreaking tale of constipation and tragedy began April 23 when the conscientious zookeeper noticed that his prize, 8,000-pound African elephant didn't seem to be producing his usual poop aplenty. 'Friedrich had actually been concerned for several days because he knew that severe constipation can kill an elephant,' assistant zookeeper Kurt Herrman recalled. 'He told me he was going to stay late that Thursday night to treat Stefan with laxatives and possibly give him an enema. 'I offered to help, but he sent me on home, saying he had everything under control.' But two hours later, horrified night watchman Walter Pleuger found Friedrich lying lifeless under a mound of muck, his body visible only from the knees down. 'I had never really thought about it before,' Det. Dern said. 'But obviously, giving an elephant an enema can be a very dangerous activity — and not something that should be attempted alone.'
  Origins:
  In the summer of 1998, this entertaining 'news item' appeared in the
  Weekly World News
  , a publication not known for adherence to strict journalistic standards. Fantastic stories invented cut of whole cloth regularly appear in its pages, and this pachyderm tale is but another of that ilk.
  Photo or not, the story is a fake. There is no zoo in Paderborn, Germany, and a check of that town's phone book fails to reveal listings for either the victim Riesfeldt or detective Erik Dern. Moreover, no reputable news agency carried the story of the unfortunate Friedrich Riesfeldt's demise.
  Even if we didn't know about the lack of a zoo in Paderborn, this story should have leapt off the page as something that had to be untrue. The key fact in this tale is Riesfeldt's foolhardy yet somewhat successful single-handed attempt to irrigate the elephant's posterior. No wild creature willingly submits to an enema. A lone zookeeper attempting to administer one to a pachyderm wouldn't get very far;
  the animal would easily brush him aside.
  The photograph supplied by the
  Weekly World News
  is clearly a fake. The posture of the elephant makes one think of a circus animal with the stand it was posed on airbrushed out, but more telling is the lack of enema implements in the shot. If Riesfeldt had truly been overcome by a sudden dam burst of excreta, where are the tools he was using? Where's the tubing and the source of water? (And who took the picture?)
  Another look at the photo confirms this shot was taken either during daylight hours or in a well-lit circus tent, certainly not in a field after sunset. According to the
  Weekly World News
  story, Riesfeldt's body was discovered by the night watchman two hours after Riesfeldt's final conversation with another
  co-worker
  in which he announced he was staying late to irrigate the elephant. I am reliably informed elephants do not cast shadows at night.
