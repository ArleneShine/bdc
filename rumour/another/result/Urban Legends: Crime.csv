"Dial 112 Instead of 911 to Contact Police in Emergency?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Dial-112-Cell-Phone-Emergency.htm","2016-01-15 01:25:12","  By David Emery
  In this viral story circulating in various forms since 2002, a female college student pursued by a man impersonating a policeman is rescued by a real police officer after dialing 112 (or *112, or #112) on her cell phone. Is 112 a valid number for emergency services on all mobile phones in the U.S.?

  EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS!!!!!!!!!
  WARNING: Some knew about the red light on cars, but not Dialing 112.
  An UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put his lights on. Lauren's parents have always told her to never pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road, but rather to wait until they get to a gas station, etc.
  Lauren had actually listened to her parents advice, and promptly called, 112 on her cell phone to tell the police dispatcher that she would not pull over right away. She proceeded to tell the dispatcher that there was an unmarked police car with a flashing red light on his rooftop behind her. The dispatcher checked to see if there were police cars where she was and there weren't, and he told her to keep driving, remain calm and that he had back up already on the way.
  Ten minutes later 4 cop cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground. The man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes.
  I never knew about the 112 Cell Phone feature. I tried it on my AT&T phone & it said, 'Dialing Emergency Number.' Especially for a woman alone in a car, you should not pull over for an unmarked car. Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going on to a safe place.
  *Speaking to a service representative at Bell Mobility confirmed that 112 was a direct link to State trooper info. So, now it's your turn to let your friends know about 'Dialing, 112'

  Analysis: As a rule of thumb, it's unwise to rely on anonymous viral messages for vital information about health and safety. Ask yourself these questions: Do you know where the information came from? Do you know who it came from? Do you have any reason to believe they know what they're talking about?
  Variants of the above story have been circulating since 2002 , when it was originally claimed that dialing #77 on a cell phone anywhere in the United States would connect the caller to police in an emergency. As we established at the time, #77 is a valid number, but only in a few select states. People in emergency situations shouldn't use #77 unless they know for a fact it works in their region.
  Newer rumors claiming that dialing 112 on a cell phone will connect the caller to state or local police 'in all 50 states' are similarly misleading. Mobile calls made to 112, which is the standard emergency phone number in Europe , may — I repeat, may — be automatically redirected to local emergency services in the U.S. depending on 1) the type of device (e.g., a GSM-based phone pre-programmed to do so), and 2) the service provider used by the caller.
  911 is still the only universal emergency number in effect throughout the U.S., whether you're calling from a land line or a cell phone. When in doubt, dial 911. Why play Russian Roulette with your life?
  The existence of 'Lauren,' the female college student in the viral tale who purportedly saved her own life by dialing #77 (or 112, or #112, etc.) to notify police when an unmarked car attempted to pull her over, has never been confirmed. While officer impersonations of the type described in the story do occur, we have no way of knowing whether the specifics of this particular story are true.

  Email example contributed by A. Mann, July 22, 2004:
  I knew about the red light on cars, but not the *677.
  It was about 1 PM in the afternoon, and Lauren was driving to visit a friend. An UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put his lights on. Lauren's parents have 4 children (high school and college age) and have always told them never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road, but rather wait until they get a gas station, etc. Lauren had actually listened to her parents advice, and promptly called *677 on her cell phone to tell the police dispatcher that she would not pull over right away.

  Analysis: What you have just read is an Ontario, Canada variant of an urban legend circulating via email since March 2002. While it's true that the OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) can be reached by dialing *677 (numerical equivalent of *OPP) on any phone in the province, the rest of the story (a college student named Lauren narrowly avoids becoming the victim of a rapist impersonating a police officer by calling the real police, etc., etc.) was cut and pasted from the original three-year-old message. The tale has never been substantiated.
  That said, there have been cases in Ontario and elsewhere of criminals impersonating police officers, so caution may be warranted for drivers pulled over in isolated areas. 'What I suggest is that you pull over as soon as it is safe but keep your doors locked and windows rolled up until you are satisfied the officer has properly identified themselves,' said a police sergeant interviewed by YorkRegion.com.
  A spokesperson for the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association said Ontario drivers can reach police in an emergency by dialing either *677 or 911.

"809 Area Code Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/fl/809-Area-Code-Scam.htm","2016-06-25 18:05:08","  By David Emery
  Viral alerts circulating since 1996 warn consumers not to comply with telephone, pager, or email requests to dial phone numbers beginning with the area code 809, 284, or 876. It's a real scam, but less prevalent than the alerts suggest.
  Description: Viral alert / Forwarded email Circulating since: Mid-1990s Status: Overblown (details below)
  Example #1: Email text contributed by Todd W., Feb. 6, 2005:
  Subject: 809 AREA CODE
  We actually received a call last week from the 809 area code. The woman said 'Hey, this is Karen. Sorry I missed you--get back to us quickly. Have something important to tell you.' Then she repeated a phone number beginning with 809. We didn't respond.
  Then this week, we received the following e-mail:
  Subject: DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809, 284 AND 876
  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY AT&T. DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809
  This one is being distributed all over the US. This is pretty scary, especially given the way they try to get you to call. Be sure you read this and pass it on to all your friends and family so they don't get scammed! MAJOR SCAM:
  Don't respond to Emails, phone calls, or web pages which tell you to call an '809' area Phone Number.
  This is a very important issue of Scam Busters because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading *extremely* quickly, can easily cost you $2400 or more, and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it.
  We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to our attention. This scam has also been identified by the National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims lots of money.
  There are lots of different permutations of this scam.
  HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
  You will receive a message on your answering machine or your pager, which asks you to call a number beginning with area code 809. The reason you're asked to call varies. It can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill, to tell you someone has been arrested, died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you are told to call the 809 number right away. Since there are so many new area codes these days, people unknowingly return these calls.
  If you call from the US, you will apparently be charged $2425 per-minute. Or, you'll get a long recorded message The point is, they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges. Unfortunately, when you get your phone bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00.
  WHY IT WORKS: The 809 area code is located in the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas). The 809 area code can be used as a 'pay-per-call' number , similar to 900 numbers in the US. Since 809 is not in the US, it is not covered by U.S. regulations of 900 numbers, which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call' number.
  There is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged. Further, whereas many U.S. homes that have 900 number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges, do not work in preventing calls to the 809 area code.
  We recommend that no matter how you get the message, if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area code that you don't recognize, just disregard the message.
  Be wary of e-mail, or calls, asking you to call an 809 area code number. It's important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare. That's because you did actually make the call. If you complain, both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company. You'll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong. Feel free to forward this entire message (or not) to your friends, family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam.

  Example #2: As shared on Facebook, Feb. 12, 2014:
  VERY COSTLY NEW AREA CODE:- READ AND PASS ALONG
  0809 Area Code We actually received a call last week from the 0809 area code. The woman said 'Hey, this is Karen. Sorry I missed you- get back to us quickly. I have something important to tell you.' Then she repeated a phone number beginning with 0809. We did not respond, this week, we received the following e-mail:
  Do Not DIAL AREA CODE 0809,0284, and 0876 from the UK .
  This one is being distributed all over the UK ... This is pretty scary, especially given the way they try to get you to call. Be sure you read this and pass it on. They get you to call by telling you that it is information about a family member who has been ill or to tell you someone has been arrested, died, or to let you know you have won a wonderful prize, etc.. In each case, you are told to call the 0809 number right away. Since there are so many new area codes these days, people unknowingly return these calls.
  If you call from the UK you will apparently be charged a minimum of £1500 per-minute, and you'll also get a long recorded message. The point is, they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges.
  WHY IT WORKS:
  The 0809 area code is located in the Dominican Republic .... The charges afterwards can become a real nightmare. That's because you did actually DID make the call. If you complain, both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company. You'll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong.
  Please forward this entire message to your friends, family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam.
  Analysis: Somewhat true. Variants of the 809 area code scam alert have circulated via email, online forums and social media since 1996. Albeit in an exaggerated and not entirely accurate fashion, the warnings describe a real scam in which consumers are tricked into dialing international phone numbers and racking up unexpected long-distance charges (though nowhere near the whopping $24,100 total or £1500 per minute reported in these rumors).
  According to AT&T , the scam has become less prevalent in recent years thanks to the preventative efforts of long distance carriers.
  The 809 area code scam can work because a few regions outside the U.S., including the Caribbean and Canada, can be dialed directly without the usual 011 international prefix. 809 is the area code of the Dominican Republic. 284 is the area code of the British Virgin Islands. 876 is the area code of Jamaica. Since these numbers aren't subject to laws outside those countries, there's no legal requirement to inform callers in advance of any special rates or fees. Perpetrators have conned victims into dialing the numbers by leaving messages claiming that a relative has been injured or arrested, an unpaid account must be settled, or a cash prize can be claimed, etc.
  AT&T advises that consumers always check the location of unfamiliar area codes before dialing. This can be done by querying the NANPA website (North American Numbering Plan), checking an area code locator website or simply Googling the area code and viewing the top result.

"90# Telephone Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/fl/90-Telephone-Scam.htm","2016-08-08 01:29:25","  By David Emery
  Urban legends about phones are extremely common. One of the most prevalent is the one about not dialing #90 or #09, due to threats from terrorists.
  Subject: Fwd: Phone Scam (fwd)
  Hi everyone,
  A friend sent me this e-mail today to warn me and anyone else of yet another phone scam. Beware.
  I received a telephone call from an individual identifying himself as an AT&T Service Technician that was running a test on our telephone lines. He stated that to complete the test I should touch nine (9), zero (0), pound sign(#) and hang up. Luckily, I was suspicious and refused.
  Upon contacting the telephone company we were informed that by pushing 90# you end up giving the individual that called you access to your telephone line and allows them to place a long distance telephone call, with the charge appearing on your telephone bill. We were further informed that this scam has been originating from many of the local jails/prisons.
  Please pass the word.
  As shocking as this may sound, the 'nine-zero-pound' story is sort of true.
  What the warning letter floating around the internet doesn't say is that this scam only works on telephones where you have to dial 9 to get an outside line. Unless you have to dial 9 to get an outside line at home, this scam does not affect residential telephone users. Dialing 'nine-zero-pound' on a residential phone will only give you a busy signal. That's it.
  On some business phones, however, dialing 'nine-zero-pound' may transfer a call to an outside operator and give the caller the opportunity to call anywhere in the world and charge it to your business' phone bill ... maybe. It all depends on how your business' telephone system is set up. If your company doesn't require you to dial 9 to get an outside line (for example, if you have a direct outside telephone line on your desk or if your company's phone system requires you to dial a number other than 9 to get an outside line) the 'nine-zero-pound' scam does not affect you. Also, if your company's phone system is set up so that you cannot make a long distance call once you have accessed an outside line (a lot of companies now limit all outside lines to local calls only), the 'nine-zero-pound' scam does not affect you either.
  The 'nine-zero-pound' story only affects those businesses that require you to dial 9 to get an outside line and then place no restrictions on who or where you can call once you get that outside line. However, keep in mind that for residential phone users, and particularly for cell phone users, there is no danger of dialing any combination of the listed numbers. This legend may have been somewhat true 20 years ago, but with new technology, is not an issue any longer. However, every now and again it pops up in chain letters to cause more confusion and worry.

"Another Close Call at the Mall","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/Another-Close-Call-At-The-Mall.htm","2016-08-23 06:49:48","  We explore the case of the murderous good samaritan who never leaves home without a knife, rope, and duct tape in the trunk of his car  the Internet version of a classic shopping mall horror story!
  Description: Forwarded email / Urban Legend Circulating since: July 1998 (this version) Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader, July 1998:
  Analysis: Horrifying, if true. Which it's not. It is an urban legend, and hardly a new one at that (see ' The Knife in the Briefcase ' and ' The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker ' for older variants).
  For weeks after the above story began circulating on the Internet in 1998, however, security personnel at Tuttle Crossing Mall in Columbus, Ohio fielded call after call after call from panicked patrons and scoop-hungry media types, nearly all of whom seemd to assume the story was at least based on a real-life event.
  It wasn't.
  'It's not true!' was the constant refrain at the mall switchboard during that time. The security office issued a statement saying no such incident had ever been reported. Columbus police investigated and said they found no evidence to substantiate the story.
  'It was nothing but a false, stupid, ridiculous, sick rumor,' an on-duty security guard told me when I called the mall to verify the story in July 1998. He was relieved when the rumor seemed to be dying down in April, he said, then became audibly perturbed when I told him it was back with a vengeance and had dozens of forwarded emails to prove it.
  'Trust no one'
  Other versions circulating concurrently  including variants set in Milpitas, California and Savannah, Georgia  featured only slight modifications. 'FYI - Ladies Beware!' began one specimen of the email. 'Be safe, Beware...' warned another. At least one variant concluded with this cautionary warning:
  A fairy tale for adults
  'Trust no one.' That's the moral, explicit or implied, of a good many popular urban legends, including such classics as ' The Kidney Snatchers ,' a chilling tale of doping and dismemberment at the hands of a global cabal of organ reapers. The persistent message is that it's a dangerous and terrifying world out there, one in which any stranger, well-dressed or otherwise, might have a knife (or a scalpel) concealed in his briefcase with which he plans to do us bodily harm.
  Apocryphal stories like these  essentially fairy tales for adults  tap into deep-seated, universal fears that are at once rational and irrational. There are dangerous people in the world, to be sure. Wisdom dictates behaving cautiously around strangers depending on the circumstances. These are givens. On the other hand, it's surely a rare and unlikely occurrence to be accosted at shopping malls by well-tailored businessmen with arsenals hidden in their briefcases.
  Beyond the cautionary tale
  Just because these stories take the form of cautionary tales with a gripping moral message doesn't mean they have anything truly useful to teach us about the world. Taken with a grain of salt, it may serve as a useful reminder to pay attention to our surroundings and guard against potentially threatening people and situations, but 'Trust no one' is hardly a practical credo to live by.
  We oughtn't conduct our lives as if every stranger is a potential axe-murderer because, among other reasons, it simply isn't the case.
  No, if urban legends teach us anything at all, they teach us about ourselves and how we perceive the world. They're a window on human psychology, exposing some of our deepest fears, wishes and resentments.
  Consider the Tuttle Mall story in particular. It's improbable in its particulars and demonstrably untrue, yet has been widely taken for fact and circulated from friend to friend to friend across the U.S. and around the world as a deadly serious warning to all women. It doesn't prove that that there are madmen lurking in parking lots everywhere, nor that our lives are in grave peril when we accept the help of strangers. It doesn't prove that every time we set foot outside our homes we ought to be afraid.
  What it does prove, by its very existence, is that we are already afraid.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: This is a hoax, circulating since May 2006. Neither the Philadelphia Police Department nor the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children lists (or has ever listed) a missing child by the name of Ashley Flores. No Amber Alert has ever been issued in her name.
  Moreover, the viral message contains none of the critical details one would expect to find in a real alert -- for example, a physical description of the missing person, the time and place of disappearance and contact information. Another giveaway is the presence in the body of the message of several sentences copied word-for-word from previous 'missing child' hoaxes (see Penny Brown and C.J. Mineo ).
  Though she never really went missing, it appears that Ashley Flores does exist and lived in Philadelphia when these alerts first started going around. By following hyperlinks embedded in a version posted on MySpace.com, I found an exact match (long since deleted) for the image above in a photo gallery on Photobucket.com, along with several others (long since deleted) that were uploaded by the same user and featured a young woman named Ashley who bore more than a passing resemblance to the girl pictured above.
  The images were posted by someone using the screen name 'Vixter609,' whom I found blogging under the same alias on MySpace.com with her given name listed as 'Vicki,' her age as 17 and her city of residence as Philadelphia.
  When I contacted Vicki to ask what, if anything, she knew about Ashley Flores and her status as a 'missing person,' I received the following reply (reproduced verbatim):
  Subsequent inquiries went unanswered. That this little joke caused 'confusion' is putting it mildly.
  After a version of the Ashley Flores email containing the contact info of the Rolla, Missouri police department circulated in 2009, said police department was forced to change its telephone number because it was receiving up to 75 calls per day on the matter. The city's online FAQ page still contains a reference to the hoax.
  The Flores alert is listed on the U.S. Department of Justice Amber Alert website as a known hoax.

"Fear of Licking","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/cockroaches/a/fear_of_licking.htm","2016-04-26 04:14:59","  In the world according to urban folklore, horrors await us at every turn, lurking even in the most ordinary places. We are warned to beware of pay-phone coin slots booby-trapped with infectious needles, chicken sandwiches pocked with pus-filled tumors and toilet seats infested with venomous spiders.
  Is nothing safe anymore? Consider how dangerous it can be just to lick an envelope.
  In 1999, rumor had it that a number of people fell down dead after moistening the glue on ATM deposit envelopes with their tongues.
  Why? Because, supposedly, someone had adulterated the glue with cyanide, a fatal poison. The moral of the story was clear: envelope licking can be hazardous to your health. Don't do it.
  Not enough people paid heed, apparently, as evidenced by the following report sent to me by a reader in January 2000:
  Huh. Not to impugn the integrity of our correspondent's co-worker's spouse, but... baloney! The entire scenario smacked of urban legend — so much so that I demanded to know where the alleged incident took place. Virginia, I was told.
  Picture my skeptical reaction when, just a few days later, I began receiving copies of a forwarded email claiming that precisely the same thing had just happened to a postal worker in California:
  A true story? I think not. The separate accounts you have just read, the first set in Virginia and the second set clear across the country in California, arrived in my inbox five days apart (and more have arrived since). They are variants of the same urban legend . Any way you tell it, the urban legend is false.
  Consider this. A pregnant cockroach carries her eggs in a hard capsule called an ootheca, in which they incubate, intact, until the larvae (or 'nymphs') hatch, bursting the capsule open from the inside. The eggs themselves are tiny and delicate, and couldn't survive at all outside the ootheca, let alone flourish within the body of a mammalian host. It would be highly improbable, is what I'm saying, to find viable cockroach eggs strewn about on random surfaces — least of all on the folded flap of an envelope.
  Consider, too, the logical inconsistencies in the story. How is it that when the victim visited her doctor the first time, reporting a paper cut and showing visible signs of 'abnormal swelling,' he found 'nothing wrong'? And what was the point, during the second doctor visit, of X-raying the poor woman's tongue?
  The 'lump' allegedly detected by the x-ray was already in plain sight.
  Infestation legends derive from and play on people's horror of insects. The subtype in which 'creepy crawlers' invade the human body provoke an especially visceral response and are particularly popular for that reason. 'Roach Eggs on Envelopes' is very similar to the 1998-vintage ' Roach Eggs in Tacos ' legend, wherein cockroach larvae ingested in a fast food restaurant purportedly incubated in the lining of the victim's mouth.
  In a general way, both stories resemble 'The Spider Bite ,' an older legend about a traveler in a foreign country who discovers a seemingly innocuous insect bite on her body after an outing:
  It's not as if wayward insects never, ever find their way into crevices of the human body — they sometimes do, to the horror not only of the victim but of anyone who happens to hear the tale.
  But the bulk of infestation legends are just that: legends. They are concocted out of the teeniest, tiniest grains of truth, a generous sprinkling of latent dread, and a heaping helping of imagination. It's hard to resist sharing them with the ones you love.
  Reuters ran a news story a few years back about a British woman who complained to her doctor of a headache and 'strange noises in her ear.' On examining her, the doctor found a large spider lodged next to her eardrum.
  'The doctor removed the spider with a syringe,' the article continued, 'but also raised an unsavory possibility — that the arachnid was a female intent on laying eggs.'
  No spider eggs were found during the examination, however. So, why raise the 'unsavory possibility' at all?
  'Tis obvious: to make a good story that much better.

  As told by reader Andy B.:
  A married couple were going out for the evening and called in a teenage babysitter to take care of their three children. When she arrived they told her they probably wouldn't be back until late, and that the kids were already asleep so she needn't disturb them.
  The babysitter starts doing her homework while awaiting a call from her boyfriend. After awhile the phone rings. She answers it, but hears no one on the other end — just silence, then whoever it is hangs up. After a few more minutes the phone rings again. She answers, and this time there's a man on the line who says, in a chilling voice, 'Have you checked the children?'
  Click.
  At first she thinks it might have been the father calling to check up and he got interrupted, so she decides to ignore it. She goes back to her homework, then the phone rings again. 'Have you checked the children?' says the creepy voice on the other end.
  'Mr. Murphy?' she asks, but the caller hangs up again.

  She decides to phone the restaurant where the parents said they'd be dining, but when she asks for Mr. Murphy she is told that he and his wife had left the restaurant 45 minutes earlier. So she calls the police and reports that a stranger has been calling her and hanging up. 'Has he threatened you?' the dispatcher asks. No, she says. 'Well, there's nothing we can really do about it. You could try reporting the prank caller to the phone company.'
  A few minutes go by and she gets another call. 'Why haven't you checked the children?' the voice says.
  'Who is this?' she asks, but he hangs up again. She dials 911 again and says, 'I'm scared. I know he's out there, he's watching me.'
  'Have you seen him?' the dispatcher asks. She says no. 'Well, there isn't much we can do about it,' the dispatcher says. The babysitter goes into panic mode and pleads with him to help her. 'Now, now, it'll be okay,' he says. 'Give me your number and street address, and if you can keep this guy on the phone for at least a minute we'll try to trace the call. What was your name again?'
  'Linda.'
  'Okay, Linda, if he calls back we'll do our best to trace the call, but just keep calm. Can you do that for me?'
  'Yes,' she says, and hangs up. She decides to turn the lights down so she can see if anyone's outside, and that's when she gets another call.
  'It's me,' the familiar voice says. 'Why did you turn the lights down?'
  'Can you see me?' she asks, panicking.
  'Yes,' he says after a long pause.
  'Look, you've scared me,' she says. 'I'm shaking. Are you happy? Is that what you wanted?'
  'No.'
  'Then what do you want?' she asks.
  Another long pause. 'Your blood. All over me.'
  She slams the phone down, terrified. Almost immediately it rings again. 'Leave me alone!' she screams, but it's the dispatcher calling back. His voice is urgent.
  'Linda, we've traced that call. It's coming from another room inside the house. Get out of there! Now!!!'
  She tears to the front door, attempting to unlock it and dash outside, only to find the chain at the top still latched. In the time it takes her to unhook it she sees a door open at the top of the stairs. Light streams from the children's bedroom, revealing the profile of a man standing just inside.
  She finally gets the door open and bursts outside, only to find a cop standing on the doorstep with his gun drawn. At this point she's safe, of course, but when they capture the intruder and drag him downstairs in handcuffs, she sees he is covered in blood. Come to find out, all three children have all been murdered.
  Analysis: Teenagers have been scaring each other silly with this urban legend since the late 1960s, though most people nowadays are probably more familiar with it as the plot of the 1979 horror film When a Stranger Calls (or the 2006 remake of the same title). It's not based on any real-life incident, so far as anyone knows, but the scenario is plausible enough to give goosebumps to anyone with a sense of what it's like to be young and inexperienced and alone in a big house caring for someone else's children.
  'The most frightening aspect of this legend is that the babysitter is not in control at any time,' writes folklorist Gail De Vos. '[T]he caller multiplies the anxiety that the babysitter is already feeling as the responsible person in the household. The possibility that this could actually happen is never far from the mind of any babysitter.'
  Never mind the unlikelihood that police would be able to trace a phone call that lasted no more than 20 seconds at most, or that an officer could be dispatched to the house so quickly. Albeit framed as a cautionary tale , the main purpose of the story is to frighten us, not give us actionable information. That it's still going around some 40 years later is a testament to how successfully it accomplishes its goal.

"The Killer in the Backseat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/killer_backseat.htm","2015-09-18 14:38:30","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Emily Dunbar:
  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911 !'

  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.
  The moral of the story: Always check the back seat!
  Analysis: In another common variant of this legend, the imperiled female (and it's always a female, please note) pulls into a gas station and is frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who keeps trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. It turns out he has glimpsed a knife-wielding murderer in the backseat and is trying to save her life!
  Folklorists have traced the legend back to the 1960s and believe it may have been inspired by a vaguely similar real event in 1964 involving the discovery by a New York City policeman of an escaped murderer hiding in the backseat of his (the cop's) own car.
  'The Killer in the Backseat' was among the legendary horror stories dramatized in the 1998 film Urban Legend . Let us not assume, however, that real-life evildoers never lie in wait for their victims in the backseats of vehicles. As reported in the Decatur Daily News on September 14, 2007, a female college student in Alabama was threatened by a man with a gun who popped up suddenly in the backseat of her SUV. She escaped, fortunately, by slamming on the brakes and bolting from the car.

"The Body Under the Bed","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/body_in_bed.htm","2016-02-07 17:50:50","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Autumn Murphy...
  A man and woman went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, and checked into a suite at a hotel. When they got to their room they both detected a bad odor. The husband called down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the room smelled very bad and they would like another suite. The manager apologized and told the man that they were all booked because of a convention. He offered to send them to a restaurant of their choice for lunch compliments of the hotel and said he was going to send a maid up to their room to clean and to try and get rid of the odor.
  After a nice lunch the couple went back to their room. When they walked in they could both still smell the same odor. Again the husband called the front desk and told the manager that the room still smelled really bad. The manager told the man that they would try and find a suite at another hotel. He called every hotel on the strip, but every hotel was sold out because of the convention. The manager told the couple that they couldn't find them a room anywhere, but they would try and clean the room again. The couple wanted to see the sights and do a little gambling anyway, so they said they would give them two hours to clean and then they would be back.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  When the couple had left, the manager and all of housekeeping went to the room to try and find what was making the room smell so bad. They searched the entire room and found nothing, so the maids changed the sheets, changed the towels, took down the curtains and put new ones up, cleaned the carpet and cleaned the suite again using the strongest cleaning products they had. The couple came back two hours later to find the room still had a bad odor. The husband was so angry at this point, he decided to find whatever this smell was himself. So he started tearing the entire suite apart himself.
  As he pulled the top mattress off the box spring he found a dead body of a woman.
  Analysis: It only takes one dead body under the mattress to spoil your whole honeymoon.
  Befitting its 'Sin City' reputation, Las Vegas has been the setting of some horrific urban legends (see ' The Kidney Snatchers ' if you don't know what I mean). What sets 'The Body in the Bed' apart from the rest is how frequently incidents resembling the one described above have actually happened in real life — just never, to my knowledge, in Las Vegas !
  The closest encounter between fact and legend I've been able to document took place in Atlantic City (another gambling mecca, naturally) in 1999. This account comes from the Bergen Record :
  The body of Saul Hernandez, 64, of Manhattan was found in Room 112 of the Burgundy Motor Inn after two German tourists slept overnight in the bed despite a rancid smell that prompted them to complain to the front desk.
  The couple told motel officials about the smell Wednesday night but stayed in the $36-a-night room anyway. On Thursday, they complained again and were given a new room while a motel housekeeper cleaned Room 112.
  In July 2003, a cleaning crew discovered a dead body stuffed under the mattress in a room at the Capri Motel in Kansas City, Missouri. This report was filed by KMBC-TV News:
  Police said that the man appeared to have been dead for some time, but the body went unnoticed until a guest staying the room could no longer tolerate the smell.
  Officers were called to the Capri Motel in the 1400 block of Independence Avenue around noon Sunday after cleaning crews made the grisly discovery.
  KMBC's Emily Aylward reported that the man who checked into the motel room a few days ago complained to management about the odor two times over the three days. He then checked out on Sunday because he could not tolerate the smell.
  In March 2010, Memphis police responded to a call from a local motel where employees had noticed a 'foul odor' in one of the rooms. According to ABC Eyewitness News:
  On March 15th, investigators were called back to room 222 at the Budget Inn, where the body of Sony Millbrook was found under the bed. Police say she was found inside the metal box frame that sits directly on the floor after someone reported smelling a strange odor. The box springs and mattress fit into the top of the bed frame.
  Room 222, according to investigators, had been rented 5 times and cleaned many times by the hotel staff since the day Millbrook was reported missing.
  Homicide investigators say Millbrook appears to have been murdered.
  There's more than one moral to these story, to be sure, but the most disturbing of all is that urban legends do sometimes come true.

  Kids are putting Drano, tin foil, and a little water in plastic drink bottles and capping it up - leaving it on lawns, in mail boxes, in gardens, on driveways etc. just waiting for you to pick it up intending to put it in the rubbish, but you'll never make it!!!
  If the bottle is picked up, and the bottle is shaken even just a little - in about 30 seconds or less it builds up enough gas which then explodes with enough force to remove some your extremities. The liquid that comes out is boiling hot as well.
  Don't pick up any plastic bottles that may be lying in your yards or in the gutter, etc.
  Pay attention to this. A plastic bottle with a cap. A little Drano. A little water. A small piece of foil. Disturb it by moving it; and BOOM!!
  No fingers left and other serious effects to your face, eyes, etc.
  Please ensure that everyone that may not have email access are also informed of this.

  Highest Paid Male Actors Ever
  Analysis: Homemade 'bottle bombs' have been around for more than two decades, albeit known by a variety of different names, including 'acid bombs,' 'Drano bombs,' 'works bombs,' 'pressure bombs' and 'MacGyver bombs.'
  Any number of YouTube videos demonstrate how to construct and detonate them. Because they're made with common household ingredients they're a favorite of teenage pranksters, but police warn that the devices are unpredictable and dangerous. Would-be bottle bomb makers need to be aware that if caught they can be charged with a felony. Penalties can be quite severe if injuries or property damage result.
  The way a Drano bomb works is simple. When the aluminum foil comes into contact with the Drano solution inside the plastic bottle, a strong chemical reaction occurs, releasing a gas which causes pressure to build up, and the bottle eventually explodes. The caustic, boiling liquid thrown off by such an explosion can cause second- or third-degree burns and/or blindness.
  News reports of Drano bomb incidents (in which the activity is sometimes described as a 'fad') have cropped up regularly since the early 1990s. An article published in the Los Angeles Times in March 1991 claimed at least eight adolescents had been injured in glass bottle bomb explosions after learning how to construct the devices from an episode of the TV show MacGyver .
  The 2010 warnings were prompted by specific incidents reported in April of that year, including the discovery of bottle bombs left in the yards of two houses in York Township, Michigan and a 'rash' of attempted mailbox bombings in Methuen, Massachusetts.
  New alerts began circulating via social media in February 2013 after a rash of Drano bomb mailbox explosions in Kennewick, Washington and the arrest of three people accused of setting off a bottle bomb in Commerce, Georgia.
  In another 2013 incident, a 16-year-old high school student was expelled and arrested for 'possession and discharge of a weapon on school grounds' in Bartow, Florida after detonating a Drano bomb in what was described as 'an extracurricular science experiment.'

"The Blue Star LSD Tattoo","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Blue-Star-LSD-Tattoo.htm","2014-10-27 15:34:51","  Message from a reader dated Sep. 21, 1998:
  Email chain letter dated Oct. 7, 1998:
  Press release from Danbury Hospital, Connecticut, June 11, 1998:
  From Mickey Mouse Acid to the Blue Star Tattoo
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand first addressed rumors about incidents involving so-called 'Mickey Mouse Acid' in his 1984 book, The Choking Doberman and Other 'New' Urban Legends . He described it as 'the most insidious urban drug legend' going because it implied, as do more recent variants, that drug dealers purposely decorate their wares with colorful cartoon images to make them attractive to small children.
  In the words of photocopied flyers proliferating throughout the 1980s, 'Mickey Mouse Acid (LSD) has been circulated widely throughout some parts of New England as a part of or in the form of a 'sticker' or label. It may be available to school age children...
  All Disney cartoon characters have been used in the distribution of this LSD.'
  Citing a 1982 press clipping describing a 'children's 'tatoo' [sic] which may contain LSD,' Brunvand theorized that the notion may have originated in an earlier (1980) police memorandum pointing out a particularly worrisome feature of a form of LSD known as 'blotter acid' (tabs of paper impregnated with LSD and imprinted with colorful images of cartoon characters): 'Children may be susceptible to this type of cartoon stamp believing it a tattoo transfer.'
  Dave Gross, keeper of the online Blue Star LSD FAQ , concurs. All it took after those first cautionary mentions, he adds, was a church group copying the vaguely-understood information into an anti-drug flyer for the urban legend to be 'on a roll.' By 1987 the tattoo warning had mutated into more or less its current form, with references to strychnine contamination, images of a 'Blue Star' (a commercial trademark), and illustrations ranging from butterflies to clowns to cartoon characters from Disney and elsewhere.
  As noted above, the flyer specifically purporting to originate from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut first surfaced in 1992. Since that time it has circled the globe many times over via photocopied posters, faxes, and forwarded email.
  Both Brunvand and Gross, having tracked the legend for years, maintain there has never been a documented case of a child mistaking blotter acid for a 'tattoo transfer' and accidentally ingesting a dose of LSD. The media have sometimes reported this accurately, sometimes not.
  Longevity
  How to explain the longevity of this urban legend and its periodic surges in popularity? For starters, there are no horror stories more compelling than those involving threats to the well-being of children.
  Consider the tale of drug smugglers using the corpses of children to transport cocaine across the U.S. border, a legend which has been around even longer than warnings about LSD tattoos (and which also undergoes frequent revivals).
  To whatever extent new eruptions of these legends can be described as cyclical, perhaps they correlate with changes in cultural attitudes toward drugs.
  In the 1980s, following what are often described as the 'excesses' of the 1970s, there was a backlash against drug use which coincides with the moment these stories made their earliest public appearances. The 'Just Say No' attitude of the Reagan era gave way to a renewed curiosity about drugs among young people coming of age in the 1990s, which in turn sparked another anti-drug backlash. And so it goes.
  Underlying truths
  As I've often pointed out in these pages, contemporary legends tend to represent our collective anxieties, particularly those for which there aren't any obvious or simple remedies. Though the stories themselves may not be corroborated in real life, the fears they represent often are.
  Just last month (September 1998), CNN ran a terrifying news story about some fourth-graders who fell ill after consuming LSD which had been injected into a vial of commercial breath freshener. According to police, one of the children had innocently shared the contaminated product with her classmates after finding it on her way to school.
  Are children literally in danger of getting dosed with LSD through drug-laced tattoos? It appears not. Are they endangered by the careless drug use of the adults around them? Clearly they can be. It's an example of how a false story can paint a true picture of the things we're most afraid of.

"Burundanga Drug Warning: The Facts","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/burundanga.htm","2016-06-04 19:22:01","  Viral alerts warn of criminals using business cards or slips of paper soaked in a potent street drug called burundanga (also known as scopolamine) to incapacitate victims before attacking them.
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: May 2008 Status: Mixed (details below)
  Example #1: Email contributed by a reader, May 12, 2008:
  Example #2: Email contributed by a reader, Dec. 1, 2008:
  Analysis: Is there a drug called burundanga that has used by criminals in Latin America to incapacitate their victims?
  Yes.
  Have news and law enforcement sources confirmed that burundanga is regularly used to commit crimes in the U.S., Canada, and other countries outside Latin America?
  No, they have not.
  The story reproduced above, circulating in various forms since 2008, is almost certainly a fabrication. Two details in particular betray it as such:
  In March 2010, Houston resident Mary Anne Capo reported to police that a man approached her at a local gas station and handed her a church pamphlet, after which her throat and tongue began to swell 'like someone was strangling me.' In an interview with KIAH-TV News, Capo said she believes there was 'something inside the pamphlet' that caused her to become ill and compared what happened to her to the alleged incident described above.
  Could it have been a burundanga attack? It seems doubtful, given that the symptoms Capo reported (swelling of the tongue and throat, feeling of suffocation) aren't consistent with those usually attributed to burundanga (dizziness, nausea, light-headedness). Also, as discussed above, it's unlikely anyone could receive a strong enough dose of burundanga through brief contact with a piece of paper to feel any ill effects.
  Could the pamphlet have contained another type of drug or chemical? Possibly, though Capo says she didn't see or smell anything unusual while handling it. We'll probably never know precisely what did happen to Mary Anne Capo that day, because she didn't undergo a medical examination and says she promptly tossed the one piece of hard evidence — the pamphlet — into the nearest trash can.
  Burundanga is the street version of the pharmaceutical drug scopolamine hydrobromide . It's made from the extracts of plants in the nightshade family such as henbane and jimson weed. It's a deliriant, meaning it can induce symptoms of delirium such as disorientation, loss of memory, hallucinations, and stupor.
  You can see why it would be popular with criminals.
  In powdered form scopolamine can be easily mixed into food or drink, or blown directly into victims' faces, forcing them to inhale it.
  The drug achieves its 'zombifying' effects by inhibiting the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain and muscles. It has several legitimate medicinal uses, including the treatment of nausea, motion sickness, and gastrointestinal cramps. Historically, it has also been used as a 'truth serum' by law enforcement agencies . And, like its street cousin burundanga, scopolamine has frequently been implicated as a stupefying agent or 'knockout drug' in the commission of crimes such as robbery, kidnapping, and date rape.
  In South America burundanga is associated in popular lore with potions long used to induce a trance-like state in shamanic rituals. Reports of the drug's use in criminal activities first surfaced in Colombia during the 1980s. According to a lurid Wall Street Journal article published in 1995, the number of reported burundanga-assisted crimes in the country approached 'epidemic' proportions in the 1990s.
  'In one common scenario, a person will be offered a soda or drink laced with the substance,' the article stated. 'The next the person remembers is waking up miles away, extremely groggy and with no memory of what happened. People soon discover that they have handed over jewelry, money, car keys, and sometimes have even made multiple bank withdrawals for the benefit of their assailants.'
  Though the frequency of such assaults has presumably declined along with the country's overall crime rate in more recent years, the U.S. State Department still warns travelers to beware of 'criminals in Colombia using disabling drugs to temporarily incapacitate tourists and others.'
  Confirmed reports of burundanga assaults appear to be less common outside Colombia, but that doesn't mean other Central and South American countries have been immune to rumors of rape and robbery committed by criminals wielding the much-dreaded 'zombie drug' or 'voodoo powder.' Some may even be true, though most of the tales circulating on the Internet smack of urban legendry.
  A Spanish-language email circulating in 2004 related the details of an incident very similar to the one already described at the top of this article, except it happened in Peru. The victim claimed she was approached by a one-legged man who asked her to help him dial a call on a public telephone. When he handed her a phone number written on a slip of paper, she immediately began to feel dizzy and disoriented, and nearly fainted.
  Luckily, she had the presence of mind to run to her car and escaped. According to the email, a blood test administered later at a hospital confirmed the victim's own suspicions: she had been slipped a dose of burundanga.
  There's more than one reason to doubt the story. First, it's unlikely that someone could absorb enough of the drug by simply handling a piece of paper to suffer any ill effects. Second, the text goes on to claim that the author was told there had been several other local cases of burundanga poisoning in which the victims were found dead, and -- lo and behold -- some of their organs were missing (a reference to the classic ' kidney theft ' urban legend ).
  Like the stories circulating in North America about criminals using ether-tainted perfume samples to knock out their victims, the burundanga emails trade on fear, not facts. They tell of alleged close calls with would-be attackers, not actual crimes. They are dysfunctional cautionary tales.
  Make no mistake, burundanga is real. It is used in the commission of crimes. If you're traveling in a region where its use has been confirmed, exercise due caution. But don't rely on forwarded emails for your facts.

  Here's a story my mom told to me and my friends when I was about seven years old. You can imagine I was scared to death...
  A woman and her boyfriend were on their way home from somewhere (not important) one night, and suddenly his car ran out of gas. It was about one in the morning and they were completely alone in the middle of the nowhere.
  The guy stepped out of the car, saying comfortingly to his girlfriend, 'Don't worry, I'll be right back. I'm just going to go out for some help. Lock the doors, though.'
  She locked the doors and sat restlessly, waiting for her boyfriend to come back. Suddenly, she sees a shadow fall across her lap. She looks up to see... not her boyfriend, but a strange, crazed looking man. He is swinging something in his right hand.
  He sticks his face close to the window and slowly pulls up his right hand. In it is her boyfriend's decapitated head, twisted horribly in pain and shock. She shuts her eyes in horror and tries to make the image go away. When she opens her eyes, the man is still there, grinning psychotically. He slowly lifts his left hand, and he is holding her boyfriend's keys... to the car.
  Analysis: 'The Dead Boyfriend' is reminiscent of the hook-man urban legend , in which a pair of teenagers necking on Lovers' Lane race off in a fright after hearing a radio alert about a murderer on the loose with a hook for a hand. On returning home they discover, to their horror, a bloody hook dangling from one of the car door handles.
  Whereas the protagonists of 'The Hook' escape with their lives, the present tale concludes with the boyfriend murdered and the girlfriend in fatal jeopardy (though in some variants she is ultimately rescued by passersby). Folklorists regard both narratives as examples of cautionary tales but tend to interpret their meanings differently. 'The Hook' is usually read as a warning against adolescent sexual activity; 'The Dead Boyfriend' has been interpreted as a more generalized warning not to stray too far from the safety of home. 'On a literal level a story like 'The Boyfriend's Death' simply warns young people to avoid situations in which they may be endangered,' writes folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, 'but at a more symbolic level the story reveals society's broader fears of people, especially women and the young, being alone and among strangers in the darkened world outside the security of their own home or car.' ( The Vanishing Hitchhiker , W.W. Norton, 1981.)
  Thematically, ' campfire stories ' such as these have much in common with the plot lines of modern horror movies, but there is an important difference. Typically, the villains in slasher films exhibit supernatural traits such as inhuman strength and 'unkillability' (e.g., Michael Myers in Halloween and Freddie in Nightmare on Elm Street ), while the hook-handed madmen and crazed axe murderers of urban legendry are only slightly exaggerated versions of the real-life serial killers we read about in newspaper headlines .

  Internet versions of a familiar urban legend claim that innocent people who unknowingly flash their headlights at gang members' cars will be chased down and killed as part of a gang initiation game. Has this really happened?
  Description: Online rumor / Urban legend Circulating since: September 2005 (this version) Status: False (details below)

  Subject: FW: Read & Heed
  Police officers working with the DARE program has issued this warning: If you are driving after dark and see an on-coming car with no headlights on, DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS AT THEM! This is a common Bloods gang member 'initiation game' that goes like this:
  The new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights, and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his 'target'. He is now required to turn around and chase that car, then shoot and kill every individual in the vehicle in order to complete his initiation requirements.
  Police Depts across the nation are being warned that September 23rd and 24th is the 'blood' initiation weekend. Their intent is to have all the new bloods nationwide drive around on Friday and Saturday nights with their headlights off.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: False. Other versions of this message have circulated online and off since the early 1990s, yet police gang units worldwide continue to insist they're unaware of any 'initiation game' involving the killing of innocent people who flash their headlights at gang members' cars.
  The above variant claims the initiation rites will be conducted by a specific gang on specific dates, but apart from those variables the message is virtually identical to warnings distributed via fax and email as early as 1993, and via social media as recently as 2013.
  Compare it to this one, an email dated November 1998:
  ...A police officer who works with the DARE Program has asked that this warning be passed on to anyone who drives: If you are driving after dark and see an oncoming car with NO headlights on -- DO NOT flash your lights at them!!! This is a new GANG MEMBER INITIATION game!
  The new member drives along with no headlights and the first car to flash their headlights at them is the 'TARGET'. The new member is required to chase the car and do whatever is required by the gang to complete the initiation requirements...
  SO, BE WARNED AND BE CAREFUL!
  And this one, posted in a gaming forum in November 2010:
  BE CAREFULL!!!!!!!!!!
  PLEASE DON'T FLASH YOUR HEADLIGHTS @ ANY CAR WITH *NO LIGHTS ON!* Police officers is working with the DARE program & has issued this Warning! If u are driving after dark & see a on-coming car with no headlights on, 'DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS AT THEM'.

"Mandatory Drug Sentencing Laws","http://crime.about.com/od/issues/i/drug_sentence.htm","2015-10-16 17:54:50","  In reaction to a virtual wave of cocaine being smuggled into the country and cocaine addiction reaching epidemic proportions in the 1980s, the U.S. Congress and many state legislatures adopted new laws that stiffened the penalties for anyone convicted of trafficking illegal drugs. These laws made jail terms mandatory for drug dealers and anyone in possession of certain amounts of illegal drugs.
  Mandatory drug sentencing for those found guilty of possession and sales of drugs is one that most Americans support.
  Voters have shown strong backing to political candidates who adopt the 'longer sentencing' position.
  Latest Developments
  More mandatory drug sentences are being proposed. Congressman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), a proponent of mandatory sentencing, has introduced a bill to Congress called 'Defending America's Most Vulnerable: Safe Access to Drug Treatment and Child Protection Act of 2004.' The bill is designed to increase mandatory sentences for specific drug offenses.
  It includes mandatory sentencing of 10 years to life in prison for any person age 21 or over who attempts or conspires to offer drugs (including marijuana) to someone younger than 18 years old. Anyone who has offered, solicited, enticed, persuaded, encouraged, induced, or coerces or possess a controlled substance, will be sentenced to a term not less than five years.
  Background
  Mandatory drug sentencing laws came about in the 1980s in the height of the War on Drugs. The seizure of 3,906 pounds of cocaine, valued then at over $100 million wholesale, from a Miami International Airport hangar on March 9, 1982 brought about the public's awareness of the Medellin Cartel -- Colombian drug traffickers working together -- and changed U.S. law enforcement's approach towards the drug trade -- and sparked new life into the War on Drugs.
  Lawmakers began to vote more money for law enforcement and began to create stiffer penalties for not only drug dealers, but for drug users.
  Pros
  Supporters of mandatory minimums view it as a way to deter drug distribution and use by extending the time that a criminal is incarcerated therefore preventing them from committing more drug-related crimes.
  One reason mandatory sentencing guidelines are established is to increase sentencing uniformity -- to guarantee that defendants, who commit similar crimes and have similar criminal backgrounds, receive similar sentences.
  Mandatory guidelines for sentencing greatly curtail judges' sentencing discretion.
  Without such mandatory sentencing, defendants in the past, guilty of virtually the same offenses under the same circumstances, have received vastly different sentences in the same jurisdiction, and in some cases from the same judge.
  Proponents argue that a lack of sentencing guidelines opens up the system to corruption.
  Cons
  Opponents to the mandatory sentencing feel that such punishment is unjust and does not allow for flexibility in the judicial process of prosecuting and sentencing individuals. Other critics of mandatory sentencing feel that the money spent in longer incarceration has not been beneficial in the war against drugs and could be better spent on other programs designed to fight drug abuse.
  A study performed by the Rand Company said such sentences have proven to be ineffective in curtailing drug use or drug related crime. 'The bottom line is that only decision makers who are very myopic would find long sentences to be appealing,' said study leader Jonathan Caulkins of Rand's Drug Policy Research Center.
  The high cost of incarceration and the small results that it has shown in fighting the war on drugs, show that such money would be better spent on shorter sentencing and drug rehabilitation programs.
  Other opponents to mandatory sentencing include Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in August 2003 in a speech to the American Bar Association, denounced minimum mandatory prison terms.
  'In too many cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust,' he said and encouraged the bar to be leaders in the search for justice in sentencing and in racial inequities.
  Dennis W. Archer, former Detroit mayor and Michigan Supreme Court Justice takes the position that 'it is time for America to stop getting tougher and start getting smarter against crime by reassessing mandatory sentencing and irrevocable prison terms.' In an article posted on the ABA website, he states, 'The idea that Congress can dictate a one-size-fits-all sentencing scheme does not make sense. Judges need to have the discretion to weigh the specifics of the cases before them and determine an appropriate sentence. There is a reason we give judges a gavel, not a rubber stamp'
  Where It Stands
  Because of cuts in many state budgets, and overcrowded prisons due to mandatory drug sentencing, lawmakers are facing a financial crisis. Many states have begun to use alternatives to imprisonment for drug offenders -- usually called 'drug courts' -- in which defendants are sentenced into treatment programs, rather than jail. In states where these drug courts have been established, officials are finding this approach to be a more effective way of approaching the drug problem.
  Research shows that drug court alternatives are not only more cost-effective than prison sentences for defendants who commit non-violent crimes, they help reduce the rate of defendants who return to a life of crime after completing the program.

"The Choking Doberman","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/chokingdoberman.htm","2015-03-12 16:24:39","  By David Emery
  As told by Lisa Foley...
  My cousin and his wife lived in Sydney with this huge doberman in a little apartment off Maroubra Road. One night they went out for dinner and a spot of clubbing. By the time they got home it was late and my cousin was more than a little drunk. They got in the door and were greeted by the dog choking to death in the loungeroom.
  My cousin just fainted, but his wife rang the veterinarian, who was an old family friend of hers, and got her to agree to meet her at the surgery. The wife drives over and drops off the dog, but decides that she'd better go home and get her hubby into bed.
  She gets home and finally slaps my cousin into consciousness, but he's still drunk. It takes her almost half an hour to get him up the stairs, and then the phone rings. She's tempted to just leave it, but she decides that it must be important or they wouldn't be ringing that late at night. As soon as she picks up the phone, she hears the vet's voice screaming out:

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  'Thank God I got you in time! Leave the house! Now! No time to explain!' Then the vet hangs up.
  Because she's such an old family friend, the wife trusts her, and so she starts getting the hubby down the stairs and out of the house. By the time they've made it all the way out, the police are outside. They rush up the front stairs past the couple and into the house, but my cousin's wife still doesn't have a clue what's going on.
  The vet shows up and says, 'Have they got him? Have they got him?'
  'Have they got who?' says the wife, starting to get really pissed off.
  'Well, I found out what the dog was choking on – it was a human finger.'
  Just then the police drag out a dirty, stubbly man who is bleeding profusely from one hand. 'Hey Sarge,' one of them yells. 'We found him in the bedroom.'
  Analysis: 'The Choking Doberman' has circulated in more or less this form for at least three decades, on as many continents. In his book of the same title, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand cites a plethora of known variants, including a British version dating back to 1973. The legend became hugely popular in the United States during the early 1980s. It was published as an allegedly firsthand account in an American tabloid called The Globe in 1981, though subsequent research revealed that the pseudonymous author ('Gayla Crabtree') had actually heard the story secondhand in a beauty parlor.
  Folklorists believe 'The Choking Doberman' is a descendant of a much older (perhaps as old as the Renaissance) European folktale about a clumsy thief whose hand is either injured or amputated while committing a crime, marking him as the perpetrator. Among other interpretations it can be read as a 'just deserts' tale in which the criminal, as a result of his own actions, undergoes a punishment appropriate to the crime.

  Profile of Hillary Clinton
  Analysis: ' The Clinton Body Count ,' a paranoia-laden relic of the Clinton-hating '90s, was resurrected in 2007 to coincide with Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. The widely-circulated text insinuates that several dozen 'friends' of the Clintons, some of whom conceivably possessed incriminating information about the former First Couple, died under 'mysterious' circumstances — i.e., were secretly done away with.
  In more ways than one, it's reminiscent of a similarly paranoid conspiracy theory floated during the Bush-hating '00s, namely the notion that forces within the Bush administration actually conceived and orchestrated the 9/11 terror attacks.
  Both theories rest on absurd presuppositions:
  1. That a U.S. president could secretly order the murders of dozens (or, in Bush's case on 9/11, thousands) of American citizens without being found out, ratted on, prosecuted, impeached, or even so much as accused of such crime by members of Congress, including staunch political opponents.
  2. That a U.S. president could flawlessly carry out such atrocities while demonstrating complete and utter fallibility (if not gross ineptitude) in the face of other, more mundane challenges (e.g., Clinton's inability to squelch accusations of sexual improprieties and avoid impeachment).
  Why is it, we must also ask, that special prosecutor Kenneth Starr , who spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars attempting to dig up dirt of any kind on the Clintons, never handed down a single indictment pertaining to these alleged murders?
  The answer is plain — because the accusations are hogwash.
  According to an article by Philip Weiss in the February 23, 1997 issue of The New York Times Magazine , the earliest version of the Clinton Body Count was authored by Indianapolis attorney Linda Thompson , founder of the right-wing American Justice Federation. The list originally contained the names of 26 alleged victims, though it has grown, and shrunk, and grown again since then, with some variants boasting over 100 names.
  It would be redundant to replicate the thorough research already done by others on the 47 cases listed in this version of the Body Count (see resources below), but for good measure I've documented the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the first five 'victims' on the list:
  James McDougal - Friend and business partner of the Clintons, died of a heart attack — not an apparent heart attack — while serving time on a fraud conviction. McDougal had a pre-existing heart condition. Prison guards placed him in solitary confinement after he refused to take a urine test and failed to provide him with the medications he kept in his cell, according to a subsquent investigation. No foul play was suspected. ('Report Details McDougal's Final Hours,' Houston Chronicle , 14 September 1998.)
  Mary Mahoney - 'One of the first interns to work at the Clinton White House,' according to her family. Not one news source reporting on her murder suggests that Mahoney, a lesbian, was poised to claim 'sexual harassment in the White House.' She died of gunshot wounds along with two other Georgetown, DC Starbucks employees during a botched robbery attempt on July 6, 1997. Per police investigations and a written confession by the killer, Carl Cooper of Washington, DC, Mahoney was shot while struggling with the perpetrator over the keys to the safe. A witness corroborated that Cooper had been planning to rob the Starbucks for at least a month before the crime occurred. ('Starbucks Police Affidavit,' Washington Post , 17 March 1999; 'Solving the Starbucks Case,' Washington Post Magazine Live Online, 3 March 2003.)
  Vince Foster - A lifelong friend of the Clintons, White House aide Vince Foster killed himself with a handgun on July 20, 1993. He had been suffering from depression. No fewer than five official investigations were conducted into the circumstances of his death, and none found evidence of foul play. In 1997, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's own report on the Vince Foster case was unsealed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. It began: 'The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death.' ('Case Closed on Vincent Foster - Again,' St. Louis Post-Dispatch , 15 Oct 1997.)
  Ron Brown - Commerce Secretary under President Clinton, Ron Brown died in a plane crash on April 3, 1996. Conspiracy theorists have alleged that X-rays of Brown's head showed 'possible bullet fragments' in the vicinity of what some described as a 'gunshot wound.' A re-examination conducted by Air Force pathologist Col. William T. Gormley and reviewed by a panel of other military pathologists found 'no bullet, no bone fragments, no metal fragments and, even more telling, no exit wound,' according to Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page. ('The Ron Brown Conspiracy Machine,' Chicago Tribune , 15 January 1998.)
  C. Victor Raiser II and his son, Montgomery Raiser - The prominent Democratic fundraiser and close friend of Bill Clinton died along with his son and four other people in an airplane crash on a fishing trip in Alaska in 1992. Raiser had no known connection with any Clinton scandal, nor was his death in any way 'mysterious.' A National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined that the pilot, who survived the crash, had stalled the plane while trying to veer away at the last minute from a dangerous, cloud-covered mountain pass. ('Air Safety Loophole May Close,' Anchorage Daily News , 18 June 1995.)

  Norton), that the specifics of the story above may be false. Brunvand contacted the police chief of Radnor, Pennsylvania, where most versions of the story say the ' Colander Copier Caper ' took place, and was told that despite repeated claims to the contrary in publications dating from the late 1970s on, no such incident ever occurred in the township.
  We also, interestingly enough, have reason to believe the story may be true. According to a letter written to Brunvand in 1993 by Judge Isaac Garb, who says he presided over the case in question, the sequence of events occurred pretty much as stated. 'I can confirm the veracity of the colander polygraph (lie detector),' Garb wrote. 'The matter came before me in court on a motion to suppress the confession.' Indeed, the only major discrepancy between Garb's account and the anecdotal version is the specified location. Most variants, including those published in newspapers, name Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, as the setting. Garb says it took place in Warminster Township, Bucks County, which would account for the Radnor police chief's denial. (Judge Garb's letter was published in Jan Harold Brunvand's 2001 book, Too Good to Be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends .)
  History of a human interest story
  The item's earliest appearance in print was in the July 22, 1977 edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer , which named 'a small police department' in Bucks County as the locale. Four months later, this version was distributed nationwide by United Press International (story dated Nov. 18, 1977):
  There's Still One Born Every Minute
  RADNOR, Pa. (UPI) — The police department here recently was told by a Bucks County judge that a Xerox machine cannot be used as a lie detector.
  Detectives bent on obtaining a confession pretended an office copier was a lie detector after a suspect agreed to undergo a polygraph test. Prior to interrogation, the sleuths placed a typewritten card in the machine reading: 'He's lying.'
  The suspect was seated near the copier. A metal colander was fastened to his head and wires ran from the colander to the Xerox machine.
  Each time investigators received answers they did not fancy, they pushed the copy button.
  Out came the message: 'He's lying.'
  Convinced that the machine was infallible, the suspect finally confessed.
  Judge Ira Garb threw the case out of court.
  'It's the kind of comic relief we need around here once in a while,' the judge laughed.
  The incident was brought up again for comic relief in a March 13, 1978 Chicago Tribune feature on the societal impact of photocopy machines.  '[T]he top prize for imaginative use of copiers,' wrote reporter Paul Weingarten, 'goes to detectives in Radner [ sic ], PA. They put a colander on the head of one unsuspecting suspect and hooked it to the Xerox machine, but they told the suspect that the machine was a lie detector. He bought it.' (Tempo section, p. B5)
  From 'News of the Weird' to Internet meme
  The email version, which typically circulates as part of a compendium of allegedly-true 'dumb criminal' stories, looks to have been snipped verbatim from News of the Weird , Chuck Shepherd's volume of human interest stories published in 1989 (New York: New American Library). It made its way onto the Internet in the early '90s, spawning minimally reworded variants such as the this one:
  Variations on the fake polygraph trick have been used as a sub-plot in episodes of several TV crime series, including Homicide: Life on the Street , The Wire , and The Unusuals .

  Analysis: Something for nothing, eh? Just send them your bank account number and they'll gladly share millions of dollars with you? Sure, sure.
  The text quoted above is an example of advance fee fraud (AFF) or, as it has become known internationally, the '419' scam, the number being the section of the Nigerian criminal code having to do with financial fraud schemes. You can find it listed at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission home page and on the FBI's website , both of which offers reliable information about the scam, in addition to addresses and phone numbers where people can report this or any other such scam offers they receive.
  The Nigerian business letter has been around in snail mail, fax and email form for more than 20 years, and it's been reported that up to 100 million dollars annually are swindled from folks who are taken in by it. The letter itself comes in numerous variations , under various supposed Nigerian officials' names and sometimes even purporting to have been sent from the Congo or other countries near Nigeria. Often the letter is all in caps, and generally will include awful grammar and misspelled words.
  If a person engages in communication with these folks and seems willing to conduct the transactions of which they speak (and some people they have actually flown to Nigeria and ultimately held hostage and otherwise harmed) at the last moment will begin the innocent-sounding requests for payment of an unforeseen fee, usually a couple thousand dollars but sometimes quite a bit more. Once that is paid and the victim is now 'invested' in the matter, the requests or, by this point, demands for further payments continue, to ruinous effect. It's very serious 'business.'
  So be careful, everybody. And don't trust unverifiable information in your inboxes!

  The key holders I am told are too beautiful to resist collecting but remember you may end up paying more including your life if you can't resist.
  Analysis: This baseless rumor grew out of a 2008 promotional campaign during which Caltex South Africa, a subsidiary of Chevron, gave out solar-powered flashing key fobs to advertise its diesel fuel. Each fob contained an LED, a battery, and a computer chip. Apparently someone dismantled one of the devices, found the chip inside, and jumped to the mistaken conclusion that it was some sort of RFID transmitter. The rumor that it was actually a 'tracking device' used by criminals was promulgated on a radio talk show and quickly found its way onto the Internet.
  Caltex responded with a statement :
  Despite this, the rumor was still circulating via forwarded email and social media postings as recently as January 2014.

  Also known as 'The Stuffed Baby'
  As told by a reader:
  A woman and her 4 year old son are visiting a border town on the Mexican side of the Texas/Mexico border. As they are walking towards the border crossing to return to the U.S., a man runs up to her and takes her child. She immediately runs to the authorities and a search ensues.
  The lady and the authorities begin walking among the cars looking for her son. The woman spots her child in a truck a couple of rows over. Her son is laying his head on the shoulders of man and appears to be sleeping.
  As the authorities close in on the vehicle, the driver jumps out of line and makes a run for it. As they are driving off, the passenger opens his door and dumps the child out into the street. As the woman and the authorities reach the child they find, to their horror, that the child has not only been murdered but has been cut open and illegal drugs have been put inside his body.
  It appears that the persons in the vehicle were drug smugglers and had decided to kidnap a child, kill them and place the drugs in the body. They would then hold the child as they approached the border and the border agents would think that the child was quietly sleeping on the shoulder of the passenger.

  My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas, who with her husband was planning a weekend trip across the Mexican border for a shopping spree.
  At the last minute their baby sitter canceled, so they had to bring along their two year old son with them. They had been across the border for about an hour when the baby got free and ran around the corner. The mother went chasing, but the boy had disappeared. The mother found a police officer who told her to go to the gate and wait.
  Not really understanding the instructions, she did as she was instructed. About 45 minutes later, a man approached the border carrying the boy. The mother ran to him, grateful that he had been found. When the man realized it was the boy's mother, he dropped the boy and ran himself. The police were waiting for him and got him.
  The boy, dead, in the 45 minutes he was missing, was cut open, ALL of his insides removed and his body cavity stuffed with COCAINE.
  The man was going to carry him across the border as if he were asleep.
  A two year old boy, dead, discarded as if he were a piece of trash for somebody's cocaine.

  God Bless you in this united effort to spread the word. You just might save a life!
  Analysis: It's always a treat to see a well-worn urban legend retooled for circulation on the Internet. Such is the case with a familiar horror story dating from the early 1970s claiming that drug smugglers have been known to use the corpses of abducted, murdered children to transport their illegal goods across national borders. We first encountered the version immediately above 1998. It continues to circulate to this day.
  Customs and law enforcement officials tell us the story isn't true. In all the decades this grisly legend has been in circulation, no real instances matching the descriptions above have been confirmed or documented.
  The legend, or the bare bones of it, anyway, got its first mainstream media airing in 1985 when the Washington Post recounted it as factual in the interests of livening up a feature about crime problems in Miami. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand noted in his mid-'80s collection of urban legends, The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton, 1986), the Post quickly found out that the story was untrue and retracted it a week later.
  The published correction read, in part:
  In the opening paragraph of an article last Monday on crime in Miami, the Washington Post recounted a story that cannot be substantiated. The story, told to a Post reporter several years ago by a Miami undercover agent, involves the smuggling of cocaine into the United States in the body of a dead baby.
  Clifton Stallings, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, said 'the story has been in circulation for some time. No one at Customs in Miami can verify it.' - Washington Post , March 30, 1985
  One customs official told the Post he had heard the story as long ago as 1973. As it was told in those days, he said, a suspiciously immobile child was spotted by an attendant on a flight from Colombia to Miami. Customs agents investigated and found that the baby, apparently deceased for some time, had been 'cut open, stuffed with cocaine and sewn shut.' It was considered a prime example of just how ruthless of international drug traffickers can be.
  As told on the Internet, it has became a much more compelling story. Set just across the U.S.-Mexico border and recounted in true 'friend of a friend' fashion ('My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas,' a frequently shared variant begins), the cautionary tale now carries a dual moral message: Drugs are evil, and never let your children out of your sight. Represented as a parent's 'true' nightmare, the online version concluded with a prayer that the story would convince people to stop using drugs. The more likely result is that has reinforced many people's already well-entrenched fears.

"'New' Car Break-in Method: Hole Under Door Lock","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Hole-Under-Door-Lock.htm","2016-05-31 04:25:19","  By David Emery
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: 2010 Status: Mixed (details below)
  Viral alert circulating via email and social media warns of a 'new' vehicle break-in method wherein thieves punch a small hole under the handle of a car door to unlock it.
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, Jan. 5, 2013:
  Hole Under Door Lock
  Wednesday, I approached my truck from the passenger side to place my computer bag in the front passenger seat.
  As I reached to open the door I noticed there was a hole right under my door handle.
  My first thought was, 'someone has shot my truck!'
  I began to think about it and inspect it a little closer and the 'light' slowly began to come on.
  I phoned my friend who owns a body shop and asked if he had any vehicles with damage to the doors that looked like a bullet hole.
  'Yes, I see it all the time. Thieves have a punch and place it right under the door handle, knock a hole through, reach in and unlock it, just as if they have a key. No alarms, broken glass, or anything.'
  I then placed a call to my insurance agent and explained it to him. I was puzzled that they left my GPS and all other belongings.
  Here is where it gets scary!
  'Oh no, he said, they want the break-in to be so subtle that you don't even realize it. They look at your GPS to see where 'home' is. Or check your address from Insurance and Registration in your glove box. Now, they know what you drive, go to your home, and if your vehicle isn't there they assume you aren't and break into your home.'
  He said they will even leave a purse or wallet and only take one or two credit cards. By the time you realize there has been a theft, they may have already had a couple of days or more to use them.
  (I didn't realize my situation for two full days!)
  They even give you the courtesy of re-locking your doors for you.
  Periodically, walk around your car, especially after you park in a shopping center or other large parking area.
  Report thefts immediately....your bank w/missing check numbers, your credit card agencies, police, and insurance companies, etc.

  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  Analysis: While we have no way of verifying the specifics of this anecdotal account, the 'hole punch' method it describes is known to police and indeed sometimes used in the commission of auto burglaries. Apparently, it works quite well. In a spate of roughly four dozen break-ins reported in Alton, Illinois over a two-month period in 2009, for example, police said at least half involved the use of 'a sharp tool to deftly punch through car doors, just under their locks to release them,' according to a local newspaper, The Telegraph . The report continues:
  The unknown sharp object penetrates the door metal, hits the lock mechanism and disengages it. The burglar or burglars slip inside the vehicle without having to break a window or otherwise heavily damage the car, which would call attention to themselves.
  Because the damage is minor, the owners may not realize they are victims until they notice items missing from the car or items that were moved. The puncture hole that the intruders leave under the lock, usually on the driver's-side door, is only up to about a half-inch in diameter.
  However, while the hole punch technique is referenced in a number of news stories published between 1990 and the present, there were many more instances cited in which cars were burgled the old-fashioned way — by smashing a window.
  Regardless of the method of entry used, precautionary measures available to vehicle owners remain the same: Install a car alarm, avoid parking in dimly lit, isolated places, and never leave valuables (including GPS devices) in plain sight.

  Also known as: 'The Runaway Grandmother,' 'The Stolen Granny '
  A friend of mine knows a family who were on vacation, driving through some remote part of the country in their station wagon. They had brought Grandma along even though she was quite elderly and not feeling well, because her heart was set on going on this one last trip with her grandchildren, and they didn't want to disappoint her.
  Unfortunately, at some point during the long drive Grandma passed away in the back seat of the car. Her grandchildren, sitting on either side of her, became hysterical.
  Since they were several hours away from the nearest sizable city, the father did the only thing he could think of to remedy the situation. He wrapped Grandma's body in a thick blanket, secured it to the luggage rack on top of the station wagon, and drove on.
  When they finally reached the outskirts of civilization the father stopped at a service station and everyone clambered out of the car while he used a payphone to call authorities and report the death. Understandably nervous and upset, he didn't realize he had left the keys in the ignition.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  When the family went back to the car they found it had been stolen, along with all their possessions ... and Grandma.
  Analysis: If this story sounds familiar, that's no doubt because it's an exceedingly common FOAFtale (friend-of-a-friend tale) dating back (at least) to World War II. Folklorist Duncan Emrich reported a variant of it in his 1972 book Folklore on the American Land , and it has appeared in several collections of urban legends since.
  Or perhaps you recognize it as one of the more amusing subplots of the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation , or in Tom Robbins' 1971 novel Another Roadside Attraction .
  You may have even run across it in your local newspaper, written up as if it were a real-life occurrence.
  The Associated Press dispatched a brief item in December 1999, to cite one example, about an incident that supposedly happened in the former U.S.S.R. According to the article, a pair of Moldavan cousins living in Ukraine, both too poor to afford a funeral for their dead grandmother, rolled up her corpse in a carpet and strapped it to the top of their car to be taken home for burial.
  When the grieving cousins stopped for a meal at a restaurant in southern Ukraine, a gang of thieves made off with their car... and Grandma.
  Among the U.S. papers that ran this suspiciously familiar story was the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, where it appeared under the headline 'Thieves Take Rug – and Grandma's Corpse.'
  It caught the attention of Jan Harold Brunvand, Salt Lake City resident, professor emeritus at the University of Utah, and author of more than half a dozen books on urban legends, including the marvelous volume Too Good to Be True , published that same year.
  Brunvand fired off a letter to the Deseret News . 'Oh, come on, editor!' it began. 'Surely you didn't believe that AP story you published on Page A14 of the Dec. 9 Deseret News about the missing Moldavan granny. This is nothing but the old 'Runaway Grandmother' urban legend that has been told worldwide for decades.'
  As a matter of fact, he scolded, in 1987 the legend had appeared in the Deseret News itself, in one of Brunvand's own weekly columns, entitled 'Grandma's Fit to Be Tied — to the Luggage Rack.'
  Did the Associated Press and Deseret News bite on an old urban legend? According to Jan Harold Brunvand, they did. Some stories, like this one, really are 'too good to be true.'

  2012 example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 16, 2012:
  A MESSAGE FROM THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL STATE OF MICHIGAN:
  SITUATION... While driving on a rural end of the roadway on Thursday morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a blanket draped over it. For whatever reason, I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head. But when I got to my destination, I called the Canton PD and they were going to check it out. But, this is what the Police advised even before they went out there to check....
  'There are several things to be aware of ... gangs and thieves are now plotting different ways to get a person (mostly women) to stop their vehicle and get out of the car.
  'There is a gang initiation reported by the local Police Department where gangs are placing a car seat by the road... with a fake baby in it.... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the abandoned baby. 'Note that the location of this car seat is usually beside a wooded or grassy (field) area and the person -- woman -- will be dragged into the woods, beaten and raped, and usually left for dead. If it's a man, they're usually beaten and robbed and maybe left for dead, too.
  DO NOT STOP FOR ANY REASON!!! DIAL 9-1-1 AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW, BUT DON 'T EVEN SLOW DOWN.
  'IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD, DO NOT STOP TO CHECK THE CAR, DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5%, AND YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THESE CRIMINALS.
  THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS, SO PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES AND THESE ARE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.' Please talk to your loved ones about this. This is a new tactic used. Please be safe. Get started NOW -- SEND THIS MESSAGE TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO BE CAREFUL AND AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SO AS NOT TO BECOME A VICTIM.

  New Warnings
  FYI, passed along from personnel at the Paulding County Courthouse, in Georgia. Several things to be aware of this year... as gangs and robbers are now plotting different ways to get a person to 'stop' their vehicle.
  Please note: There is a gang initiation reported by the local police department that gangs are placing a car seat by the road ... with a fake baby in it... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the baby. Note that the location of this car seat will usually be beside a wooded or grassy (field) area ...and the person - woman - will be dragged into the woods - beaten and raped - usually left for dead. DO NOT STOP. DIAL 9-1-1 AND INFORM THEM...
  IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD. DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5% SO YOU ARE FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF ROBBERS. THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY ROBBERS. PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  2009 example: Email contributed by Steven K., Nov. 18, 2009:
  Fwd: NEW TRICK TO ROB YOU...
  If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield.
  Do not operate the wiper and spray any water because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% so you are forced to stop at the roadside and become a victim of robbers.
  This is a new technique used by robbers.
  Please inform your friends and relatives.
  Analysis: These warnings originated as separate messages that were eventually combined into one. We don't know by whom. As you can see from the older examples above, the eggs-on-windshields alert first began circulating, with no mention of babies in car seats, in late 2009. A few months later it was merged with a separate alert ( also circulating since 2009 ) claiming that wannabe gangsters are leaving infant car seats on roadsides to trick drivers into stopping as part of a ' gang initiation ' rite.
  Both warnings were, and are, hoaxes. I've searched for police reports and news stories documenting the use of such tactics by criminals anywhere in the U.S. and found none. Moreover, law enforcement agencies across North America have issued statements dismissing these warnings as fictitious and urging citizens to ignore them (see examples below).

  Dear Urban Legends:
  I heard this one in 1996 when I was living up in Seattle. The teller seemed to think it was happening at that time in and around the Pugetopolis, but that seemed unlikely to me. However, if the story were told in the context of, say, Los Angeles (or even New York , Chicago, Detroit, etc.) it would actually seem sort of plausible. Anyway, here goes:
  The story is that a new gang initiation ritual has become prevalent in our city. The hoodlums pile in a car, at night, and drive the highways and byways with their lights off. The first person who 'flashes' them with their lights (in the time-honored gesture of 'hey, idiot, your lights are off!') becomes their prey. The gangbangers then pursue the samaritan and the initiate must gun him or her down without mercy.
  Sounds like a myth, right? But do you suppose there is a kernel of truth to the rumor; that perhaps somewhere at sometime some thugs did, in fact, use this modus operandi?

  Dear Reader:
  Apart from one or two copycat incidents which may have been inspired by this urban legend (not the other way around), I don't think so. This story has run rampant in virtually every major U.S. city since the early 1990s, sparking public panics and police investigations, but no one has ever documented an actual ' gang initiation ' incident matching this description in all that time.
  It is believed that one of the earliest outbreaks of the rumor (in 1993) may have been inspired by a real-life incident that occurred one year before -- the shooting of Stockton, California school secretary Kelly Freed, who was a passenger in an automobile whose driver gestured at a car full of teenagers to inform them that their headlights were off. Mistaking the hand signal as an insult, one of the teens fired a gun at the car Freed was riding in, killing her. Police determined that none of the youths were gang members, nor was the incident connected with an 'initiation rite.'
  On the Internet
  Email versions of what has come to be known as the 'Lights Out' legend began appearing in October 1998, perhaps inspired by the release of the popular horror film ' Urban Legend ,' in which the apocryphal gang-initiation tale figured prominently. The online alerts resulted in a fresh flurry of panicked inquiries to police departments in cities and towns throughout the U.S., many of which were already aware of the rumor by then but lacked the information to either substantiate or disprove it.
  In November of that year, John Moore, senior research associate at the National Youth Gang Center based in Tallahassee, stated that to the best of his knowledge the 'Lights Out' legend is completely false: 'I know of no incident in the country where this type of thing occurred,' he told a reporter for the Washington Post . 'This is one of the wonders of the Internet, that you can take something that has no basis in fact and make people believe it.'
  Nevertheless, probably because they fear the possibility of copycat outbreaks, some law enforcement agencies still recommend that motorists play it safe and refrain from flashing their headlights when driving in areas where gang activities are known to occur.
  Example #1: Email text contributed by Trevor M., Nov. 25, 1998:
  THIS IS NOT A JOKE
  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.
  The police officer that works with the DARE program at an elementary school passed this warning on.... If you're ever driving after dark and see an on-coming car with no headlights turned on, DO NOT flash your lights at them! This is a common gang member 'initiation game' that goes like this: the new gang member under initiation drives along with no headlights and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his 'target'. He is now required to turn around and chase that car and shoot at or into the car in order to complete his initiation requirements. Make sure you share this info with all the drivers in your family!! Stay safe!!
  Example #2: Email text contributed by Ernest W., July 3, 2000:
  ****** STATE POLICE WARNING TO NIGHT DRIVERS THE FOLLOWING BULLETIN WAS PUBLISHED BY THE BETHLEHEM,PA. STATE POLICE
  Please be advised if you are driving after dark and you see a car without headlights on DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS.... BLOW YOUR HORN... DO NOT SIGNAL THE CAR IN ANY WAY!!!
  This is a new GANG MEMBER initiation called 'GAME' going on in the street and it works like this: The new member being initiated drives along with their headlights off until someone notices and flashes their at him. The car that signals to the gang member is now the 'TARGET' of the game. The gang member is required to chase the car that signaled and SHOOT at, or into the car in order to complete initiation requirements.
  Police ask you to share this information with your family, friends and anyone else you come into contact with. This bulletin originally came from the 3rd district of Cleveland, Ohio Police Department. We understand it is beginning to happen in the Pittsburgh, PA area also and the warning is because this could escalate into any other geographic areas.

"Crime Alert: Eggs on Windshield / Fake Baby in Car Seat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/eggs_windshield_crime_alert.htm","2015-03-26 17:44:54","  By David Emery
  Viral alerts warn of two new techniques allegedly used by criminals to trick drivers into stopping their vehicles: throwing raw eggs at windshields and leaving infant car seats with fake babies in them beside the road. Authorities say these warnings are unfounded.
  
  Description: Viral alert / Forwarded email Circulating since: Nov. 2009 Status: False (see details below)
  2012 example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 16, 2012:
  A MESSAGE FROM THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL STATE OF MICHIGAN:
  SITUATION... While driving on a rural end of the roadway on Thursday morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a blanket draped over it. For whatever reason, I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head. But when I got to my destination, I called the Canton PD and they were going to check it out. But, this is what the Police advised even before they went out there to check....
  'There are several things to be aware of ... gangs and thieves are now plotting different ways to get a person (mostly women) to stop their vehicle and get out of the car.
  'There is a gang initiation reported by the local Police Department where gangs are placing a car seat by the road... with a fake baby in it.... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the abandoned baby. 'Note that the location of this car seat is usually beside a wooded or grassy (field) area and the person -- woman -- will be dragged into the woods, beaten and raped, and usually left for dead. If it's a man, they're usually beaten and robbed and maybe left for dead, too.
  DO NOT STOP FOR ANY REASON!!! DIAL 9-1-1 AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW, BUT DON 'T EVEN SLOW DOWN.
  'IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD, DO NOT STOP TO CHECK THE CAR, DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5%, AND YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THESE CRIMINALS.
  THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS, SO PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES AND THESE ARE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.' Please talk to your loved ones about this. This is a new tactic used. Please be safe. Get started NOW -- SEND THIS MESSAGE TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO BE CAREFUL AND AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SO AS NOT TO BECOME A VICTIM.

  2010 example: Email contributed by Denise C., March 12, 2010:
  New Warnings
  FYI, passed along from personnel at the Paulding County Courthouse, in Georgia. Several things to be aware of this year... as gangs and robbers are now plotting different ways to get a person to 'stop' their vehicle.
  Please note: There is a gang initiation reported by the local police department that gangs are placing a car seat by the road ... with a fake baby in it... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the baby. Note that the location of this car seat will usually be beside a wooded or grassy (field) area ...and the person - woman - will be dragged into the woods - beaten and raped - usually left for dead. DO NOT STOP. DIAL 9-1-1 AND INFORM THEM...
  IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD. DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5% SO YOU ARE FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF ROBBERS. THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY ROBBERS. PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  2009 example: Email contributed by Steven K., Nov. 18, 2009:
  Fwd: NEW TRICK TO ROB YOU...
  If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield.
  Do not operate the wiper and spray any water because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% so you are forced to stop at the roadside and become a victim of robbers.
  This is a new technique used by robbers.
  Please inform your friends and relatives.
  Analysis: These warnings originated as separate messages that were eventually combined into one. We don't know by whom. As you can see from the older examples above, the eggs-on-windshields alert first began circulating, with no mention of babies in car seats, in late 2009. A few months later it was merged with a separate alert ( also circulating since 2009 ) claiming that wannabe gangsters are leaving infant car seats on roadsides to trick drivers into stopping as part of a ' gang initiation ' rite.
  Both warnings were, and are, hoaxes. I've searched for police reports and news stories documenting the use of such tactics by criminals anywhere in the U.S. and found none. Moreover, law enforcement agencies across North America have issued statements dismissing these warnings as fictitious and urging citizens to ignore them (see examples below).

"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_gun_shop_shootout.htm","","  Description: Forwarded email Circulating since: 1998 / Earlier? Status:  Partly true
  Example: Email text contributed by Phil R., March 28, 2005:
  Darwin Award
  We have a winner...!
  The following mind-boggling attempt at a crime spree in Washington appeared to be the robber's first (and last), due to his lack of a previous record of violence, and his terminally stupid choices:
  1. His target was H&J Leather & Firearms, a gun shop specializing in handguns.
  2. The shop was full of customers - firearms customers.
  3. To enter the shop, the robber had to step around a marked police car parked at the front door.
  4. A uniformed officer was standing at the counter, having coffee before work.
  Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a hold-up, and fired a few wild shots from a .22 target pistol. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, the police officer with a 9mm Glock 17, the clerk with a .50 Desert Eagle, assisted by several customers who also drew their guns, several of whom also fired.
  The robber was pronounced dead at the scene by Paramedics. Crime scene investigators located 47 expended cartridge cases in the shop. The subsequent autopsy revealed 23 gunshot wounds. Ballistics identified rounds from 7 different weapons.
  No one else was hurt in the exchange of fire.
  Analysis: This is a highly embellished account of a real-life incident that occurred in Renton, Washington on February 3, 1990. According to a series of reports published in the Seattle Times , what actually happened is this:
  Thirty-three-year-old David Zaback entered H&J Leather & Firearms Ltd. at approximately 4:40 in the afternoon brandishing a .38-caliber semiautomatic handgun and announced his intention to rob the store. He threatened to shoot anyone who got in his way.
  Having apparently failed to notice the police car parked in front of the gun shop when he walked in (true!), Zaback found himself confronted by a uniformed officer and an armed clerk, who ordered him to drop his gun. Zaback opened fire instead, drawing a fatal volley of shots from the clerk and the policeman, both of whom survived the shootout unharmed.
  According to the county medical examiner, Zaback was shot a total of four times (not 23) and died a few hours later in the emergency room. 'Several' armed patrons also drew weapons, the Times confirms, but none actually fired on Zaback, contrary to the version of events given in the email. It was later determined that the clerk, whose weapon was a 10mm semiautomatic pistol (not a .50 Desert Eagle), fired the fatal shot.

  A forwarded email attributed to Cincinnati news reporter John Popovich claims that Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton's new husband, is the son of Edward Mezvinsky, a former Iowa Congressman who was convicted and sent to prison in the early 2000s for fraud. The forwarded email is correct.

  FATHER OF THE GROOM
  It figures ... We tend to marry into families who share like values!
  By: John Popovich
  Before I came to Cincinnati, I was a news reporter at WOC in Davenport Iowa. I covered a lot of city council and a lot of political stuff. One of the guys I covered was Ed Mezvinsky, who was the Congressman from Iowa's first district.
  Seemed like a pretty nice guy, but when he ditched his wife for a New York reporter, the Iowa voters ditched him.
  My most vivid memory is that he sat on the House Judiciary Committee that was deciding the fate of President Nixon.
  Anyway, years later, 'Fast Eddie' got caught with his hand in the till. He cheated investors out of more than $10 million dollars. He went to prison for several years.
  This weekend, his son married Chelsea Clinton.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Analysis: True. On July 31, 2010, Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former president and first lady Bill and Hillary Clinton, was married to Marc Mezvinsky, the son of a former Democratic Congressman, in a Rhinebeck, New York ceremony the press described as 'lavish.'
  The father of the groom, Edward 'Ed' Mezvinsky , who served four years in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973 to 1977, indeed went on to serve five years in a federal penitentiary after being convicted of fraud in 2002.
  According to prosecutors, Mezvinsky crimes included repeatedly defrauding others 'by misusing attorney escrow accounts held in his name, engaging in schemes involving worthless checks deposited at banks, creating forged bank statements, using false financial statements, tax returns and accountant's letters, and giving false testimony under oath.' U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell ordered him to pay nearly $10 million in restitution to the victims of his scams.
  The former Congressman was contrite in an interview with the New York Post that took place in July 2010 just before the Clinton-Mezvinsky wedding. 'I'm remorseful for what happened,' he said. 'It was a terrible time, and I was punished for that. And I respect that and accept responsibility for what happened, and now I'm trying to move on and am grateful I have the opportunity for that.'
  For purposes of verification, I attempted to contact former Cincinnati newsman John Popovich, to whom the above text is attributed. I received no reply.
  Update: Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky became parents with the birth of their first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, on September 26, 2014.

"How to Replace Mutilated US Currency","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/consumerawareness/a/replacemoney.htm","2016-07-04 13:44:44","  By Robert Longley
  Every year the U.S. Treasury redeems over $30 million worth of damaged and mutilated currency. Do you know how to get damaged US currency replaced? The correct procedure for replacing US currency depends on how and how badly the money has been damaged. According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), U.S. currency that has been damaged, but not mutilated can be redeemed at a bank, while truly mutilated bills require special handling.
  During fiscal year 2005, the BEP’s Office of Currency Standards handled more than 26,000 mutilated currency claims and sent out reimbursement checks for over $97 million.
  Damaged but not mutilated currency includes any bill that is CLEARLY more than one-half of the original bill, and does not require any special examination or investigation to determine its value. Examples of non-mutilated bills include those that are badly soiled, dirty, defaced, disintegrated, limp, torn or otherwise 'worn out.' These damaged-but-not-mutilated bills can be exchanged through your local bank.
  Mutilated currency is considered to be any bill NOT CLEARLY more than one-half of the original bill and/or requires special examination to determine its value.  Mutilated currency is most often damaged by fire, flooding, chemicals, explosions, animals or insects. Another very common source of damage to currency is petrification or deterioration by burying. Mutilated currency must be mailed or personally delivered to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . Here, according to the U.S. Treasury, is how to do it: When mutilated currency is submitted, a letter should be included stating the estimated value of the currency and an explanation of how the currency became mutilated. Each case is carefully examined by an experienced mutilated currency examiner. The amount of time needed to process each case varies with its complexity and the case workload of the examiner. The Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has the final authority for the settlement of mutilated currency claims. Although Treasury examiners are usually able to determine the amount and value of mutilated currency, carefully packaging the currency is essential to prevent additional damage.
  The following procedures should be used when packing mutilated currency for examination and possible replacement by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing:
  If the currency was rolled up when mutilated, do not attempt to unroll or straighten it out.
  Mutilated currency, packed according to the above instructions, should be mailed to:
  All mutilated currency should be sent by 'Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested.' Purchasing postal insurance on the shipment is the responsibility of the sender. For cases that are expected to take longer than four weeks to process, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing will issue a written confirmation of receipt. To obtain information about your mutilated currency shipment, contact the Mutilated Currency Division at 1-866-575-2361 or 202-874-8897. Personal deliveries of mutilated currency to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing are accepted between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 2:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, except holidays. The Office of Currency Standards is located at 14th and C Streets, S. W., Washington, D. C.

  Also known as: 'The Runaway Grandmother,' 'The Stolen Granny '
  A friend of mine knows a family who were on vacation, driving through some remote part of the country in their station wagon. They had brought Grandma along even though she was quite elderly and not feeling well, because her heart was set on going on this one last trip with her grandchildren, and they didn't want to disappoint her.
  Unfortunately, at some point during the long drive Grandma passed away in the back seat of the car. Her grandchildren, sitting on either side of her, became hysterical.
  Since they were several hours away from the nearest sizable city, the father did the only thing he could think of to remedy the situation. He wrapped Grandma's body in a thick blanket, secured it to the luggage rack on top of the station wagon, and drove on.
  When they finally reached the outskirts of civilization the father stopped at a service station and everyone clambered out of the car while he used a payphone to call authorities and report the death. Understandably nervous and upset, he didn't realize he had left the keys in the ignition.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  When the family went back to the car they found it had been stolen, along with all their possessions ... and Grandma.
  Analysis: If this story sounds familiar, that's no doubt because it's an exceedingly common FOAFtale (friend-of-a-friend tale) dating back (at least) to World War II. Folklorist Duncan Emrich reported a variant of it in his 1972 book Folklore on the American Land , and it has appeared in several collections of urban legends since.
  Or perhaps you recognize it as one of the more amusing subplots of the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation , or in Tom Robbins' 1971 novel Another Roadside Attraction .
  You may have even run across it in your local newspaper, written up as if it were a real-life occurrence.
  The Associated Press dispatched a brief item in December 1999, to cite one example, about an incident that supposedly happened in the former U.S.S.R. According to the article, a pair of Moldavan cousins living in Ukraine, both too poor to afford a funeral for their dead grandmother, rolled up her corpse in a carpet and strapped it to the top of their car to be taken home for burial.
  When the grieving cousins stopped for a meal at a restaurant in southern Ukraine, a gang of thieves made off with their car... and Grandma.
  Among the U.S. papers that ran this suspiciously familiar story was the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, where it appeared under the headline 'Thieves Take Rug – and Grandma's Corpse.'
  It caught the attention of Jan Harold Brunvand, Salt Lake City resident, professor emeritus at the University of Utah, and author of more than half a dozen books on urban legends, including the marvelous volume Too Good to Be True , published that same year.
  Brunvand fired off a letter to the Deseret News . 'Oh, come on, editor!' it began. 'Surely you didn't believe that AP story you published on Page A14 of the Dec. 9 Deseret News about the missing Moldavan granny. This is nothing but the old 'Runaway Grandmother' urban legend that has been told worldwide for decades.'
  As a matter of fact, he scolded, in 1987 the legend had appeared in the Deseret News itself, in one of Brunvand's own weekly columns, entitled 'Grandma's Fit to Be Tied — to the Luggage Rack.'
  Did the Associated Press and Deseret News bite on an old urban legend? According to Jan Harold Brunvand, they did. Some stories, like this one, really are 'too good to be true.'

"Social Security Warns of ID Theft Scams","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Jury-Duty-Scam-Warning.htm","2016-10-13 10:40:11","  By Robert Longley
  Almost 70 million Americans depend on Social Security benefits . Sadly, whether you are already receiving benefits or not, your Social Security account is a tempting target for scammers. The sheer complexity of this mainline federal assistance program makes Social Security accounts particularly vulnerable to hacking by cyber attackers. As a result, the Social Security Administration has identified some particularly dangerous scams you should be aware of whether you are already receiving benefits or plan to in the future.
  The Social Security Administration (SSA) strongly urges all current and future beneficiaries to set up a personal “My Social Security” account on its website at SSA.gov . Having a My Social Security account, allows you to check the size of your current or future benefits and change your bank account direct deposit information or mailing address without having to visit your local Social Security office or wait on hold to speak to an agent.
  The bad news is that scammers also take advantage of many My Social Security accounts.
  In this bit of awful, scammers set up My Social Security accounts in the names of people who do not already have them, thus allowing them to transfer the victims’ current or future benefits to their own bank accounts or debit cards. While Social Security will reimburse victims of this scam, it can take months and leave you without benefits during that period.
  Scammers can only set up a bogus My Social Security account in your name if they already know your Social Security Number and other personal information, which in today’s data-breach-of-the-week environment is all too likely. So, the thing to do is set up your account as soon as possible. Anyone over age 18 can set up a My Social Security account. Even if you do not intend to start drawing benefits for years, a My Social Security account can be a valuable retirement planning tool. When you set up your account, be sure to choose the “Add Extra Security” option on the online signup form. This option will cause a new security code to be sent to your cell phone or email ever time you try to access your account. You will need to enter the code in order to log on. It is sort of inconvenient, but far better than having your benefits stolen.
  [ Risks and Benefits of Taking Social Security at 62 ]
  This a whole set of scams in which the perpetrator -- posing as a Social Security “agent” -- calls victims regarding their benefits. For example, the scammer may claim the SSA needs to verify the victim’s direct deposit information. In another more complex scam, the victim is told that their Social Security benefits are being cut because they have inherited a house from a relative; an event that would not result in a reduction of their Social Security benefit. To help perpetrate the fraud, the caller then places the recipient on hold and plays the same on-hold recordings actually used by Social Security. When the scammer comes back on the line, the victim is that told proceeds from the sale of the house will be sent to them if they pay the back taxes. Of course, there are no inherited houses or back taxes.
  The SSA recommends taking extreme precautions before giving out personal information. “You should never provide your Social Security number or other personal information over the telephone unless you initiated the contact, or are confident of the person to whom you are speaking,” says the agency. “If in doubt, do not release information without first verifying the validity of the call.” Which you can do by calling Social Security’s toll free number at 1-800-772-1213 to verify the legitimacy of the call. (If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call Social Security's TTY number at 1-800-325-0778.) Also be aware that scammers have also perfected the black cyber crime art of “ caller ID spoofing ,” so even if your caller ID says, “Social Security Administration,” it is probably just another scammer.
  Given the number of actual government data breaches these days, this scam is particularly believable and dangerous. The scammer – again pretending to work for Social Security – tells the victim that the agency’s computers have been hacked. In order find out if the victim's account has been compromised, the scammer says he needs to verify that the SSA has the victim’s correct bank account information. To set the hook, the scammer gives the victim account information he knows is incorrect. In the end, the victim is tricked into giving the scammer their correct bank account information. Bad, very bad.
  The SSA recommends ignoring calls and emails regarding account data breaches. The agency never initiates contact with beneficiaries by phone or email. Even letters regarding data breaches can be scams as scammers have gotten very good at making envelopes and letters look “official.” If you get such a letter call the real Social Security Administration at 800-772-1213 to find out if the letter is legitimate. If the letter gives any other number to call, do not call it.
  While it hasn’t happened since 2014, Social Security adds a cost of living adjustment (COLA) in most years based on the rate of inflation . But, when there is no increase in the consumer price index (CPI), as was the case in 2015 and 2016, there is no COLA for Social Security recipients. Scammers – again posing as SSA employees -- take advantage of these non-COLA years by calling, emailing or sending letters to victims stating that the SSA had apparently “forgotten” to apply the COLA increase to their accounts. As with other scams, victims are given a form or link to a website where they can “claim” their COLA increase by providing their Social Security Number and bank account information. By now, you know what happens next. Tell your money goodbye.
  Ignore the letters, calls or emails. When and if they are given, Social Security applies COLAs automatically and without fail to the accounts of all current beneficiaries. You never have to “apply” for them.
  In this one, the scammer, again posing as an SSA employee, tells the victim that the agency is replacing all old paper Social Security cards with new high tech, “ID theft proof” computer chips embedded in them. The scammer tells the victim that they will not get any more benefits until they have gotten one of the new cards. The scammer then claims that he can “expedite” the replacement card if the victim provides their identity and bank account details. Clearly not the smart thing to do.
  Ignore the claims. The SSA has plans, desire or money to replace millions of old Social Security cards or to start issuing high-tech cards. In fact, the SSA recommends you not even carry your Social Security card with you do to the threat of identity theft. Instead, memorize your Social Security number and put the card in a safe, secret place.
  The SSA’s office of inspector general asks Americans to report known or suspected incidents of scams. Reports can be submitted online at the SSA’s Report Fraud, Waste or Abuse website.
  Reports can also be submitted by mail to:
  Social Security Fraud Hotline​ P.O. Box 17785 Baltimore, Maryland 21235

"'Good Samaritan' May Have Been Serial Killer","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/dropped_bill.htm","2011-07-07 13:37:09","  By David Emery
  Email rumor claims a man posing as a good samaritan attempted to gain entry to a woman's vehicle by 'returning' a $5 bill she supposedly dropped. Was he the Baton Rouge serial killer?

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: Even though police arrested a suspect in the Baton Rouge serial killings on May 28, 2003, effectively ending the murderer's two-year reign of terror, email tales like the one above continue to spread, keeping the fear alive. The text was false even when the serial killer was still on the loose, according to a March 20 report in the Louisiana State University Reveille . Now it's outdated, as well. I don't mean suggest that such an incident couldn't possibly occur — it could, and that's one reason this legend-in-the-making touches a nerve despite its untruth. Like ' The Knife in the Briefcase ,' an urban legend recounting a female shopper's close call with a killer posing as a good samaritan in a mall parking lot, for women this is a cautionary tale that strikes very close to home. Viewed as such, one might argue that stories of this type, even when false, have some redeeming value — at least to the extent that they encourage potential victims to be generally cautious. By the same token, however, to the extent that they confuse and misdirect by focusing people's fears on fictitious scenarios instead of real ones, arguably they cause more harm than good — a point to consider next time you're tempted to forward the latest scaremail. Update: A new version of this email circulating since 2006 claims the $5 bill trick is now being used by rapists to dupe unsuspecting female victims.

"The Grateful Terrorist","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/grateful_terror.htm","2014-12-17 03:15:56","  A person identified only as an 'Arab' or 'Muslim' repays a stranger's act of kindness with a cryptic warning not to go to a specific place at a specific time, supposedly saving them from a planned terrorist attack.
  Description: Rumor / Urban legend Circulating since: 2001 Status: False (see details below)
  Example #1: Email contributed by J. Blanchette, Oct. 30, 2001:
  Example #2: Email contributed by 'kaseydia,' Oct. 31, 2001:
  Example #3: Email contributed by Scott F., Jan. 6, 2009:
  Analysis: Personal anecdotes about an 'Arab,' 'Muslim,' or 'turban-wearing' stranger repaying an act of kindness with a warning not to be in a certain place at a certain time — apparently implying foreknowledge of an impending terrorist attack — proliferated in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and continue to crop up on occasion, particularly when violence in the Middle East flares.
  The most recent specimen quoted above made the rounds via word of mouth, text message, and email during the Israeli attack on Gaza in early January 2009. Specifically targeting Jewish people in and around New York City, variants of the rumor ranged from warnings to avoid specific locations such as bridges and tourist spots ('An Israeli police officer pulled over an Arab taxi guy and found sketches of the Verrazano Bridge and Times Square dated 1/7/09'), to warnings that Manhattan should be avoided entirely ('A Jewish woman gave a tip to a Muslim taxi driver and out of appreciation he warned her not to go to Manhattan next week Wednesday'). Officials said they knew of no credible threats matching any version of the story, which New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne dismissed as an 'urban myth.'
  Nevermind the improbability of the tale (real terrorists are deadly serious people with too much at stake to drop casual hints of their plans), it has been told too often, and in too many places, to be true. None of these anecdotal warnings of future attacks has proven accurate to date. As is often the case with rumors and legends, however, such stories do accurately reflect prevailing sentiments in the communities in which they spread — fear and uncertainty in the face of a perceived threat, for example.
  Psychologists view them as collective responses to situations in which people feel both endangered and powerless. It's a way of venting, of expressing what everyone feels, on the one hand, while 'managing' the looming threat (albeit by spreading misinformation), on the other. Along with the many known minor variations dating from late 2001 — e.g., our 'Middle-Eastern man' repays a kindness extended at a grocery store, drug store, subway turnstile, gas station, or airport (etc.) by warning his benefactor not to go to New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Boston, Birmingham, England, or a particular 7-11 in Hollywood, California (etc.) — a notorious 2002 spin-off had the grateful terrorist warning his benefactor not to drink Coca-Cola after a certain date.
  This variant circulated so heavily thanks to the Internet that the Coca-Cola Co. took the extraordinary measure of issuing a press release decrying it as 'absolutely false' and a source of 'needless worry.'
  According to Hoaxes, Myths, and Manias author Benjamin Radford, the main motif predated the terrorist attacks of 9/11 by many years. 'It's a modern variation of an urban legend that's been around — the dangerous person who tells a secret to a helpful stranger,' he told the Kansas City Star in 2003. 'Years ago in Europe, you heard it applied to IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorists.'

"The Grocery Store Scam","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/fl/Grocery-Store-Scam.htm","2015-11-03 15:51:21","  By David Emery
  As told by a reader...
  This friend of my cousin is in the grocery store, shopping. An older woman keeps following her around and staring at her. It started to creep her out, because everywhere she went the old woman kept following her and staring at her until she could no longer stand it. She stops her cart in the middle of the aisle and asks the old lady, 'Why do you keep staring at me?'
  The old lady apologizes and says, 'You look so much like my daughter who died just a few months ago that I couldn't help staring at you. I loved her so much and I never had a chance to say goodbye before she passed away. That's the biggest regret of my life. I didn't make it to the hospital in time to say goodbye.'
  At this point, my cousin's friend starts to feel sorry for the weeping old lady and apologizes for being harsh and confronting her like that. The old lady says it's okay and asks her to continue shopping with her, just like she used to do with her own daughter.

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  When they get to the cashier, the old lady goes in line first and tells my cousin's friend to do her a big favor that would ease her grieving. The favor is to say, 'Goodbye, Mom. I love you,' when she leaves.
  Well, the cashier rings all of the old lady's purchases, then she leans in and says something to the cashier that my cousin's friend didn't hear. The old lady then turns around, waves and says goodbye, to which my cousin's friend replies, helpfully, 'Goodbye, Mom. I love you.' The old lady sweetly smiles and walks away.
  Then, when my cousin's friend got to the cashier, her purchases were added up and the amount given to her was way higher than expected. When she questioned the cashier about the discrepancy, she was told that her 'mother' (the old lady) told the cashier that 'her daughter' standing behind her was paying for all her purchases. By the time she had explained what happened and they went into the parking lot, the old lady was already pulling away in her car, laughing.
  Analysis: While this tale may or may not depict an actual scam commonly perpetrated by con artists, we know for certain it has a pedigree as an urban legend . Folks have been telling versions of the same story for at least 20 years on three different continents. The basic premise — i.e., a con man or woman creates a ruse to stick someone else with the tab for groceries or a meal at a restaurant — is even older, and has shown up in many comedy routines, TV shows and film scripts over the years.
  Like other scam stories people tell, the ruse is a trifle more complicated than the methods criminals more typically use to separate victims from their cash or possessions. But that doesn't mean it's never happened. A police lieutenant who commented on the set-up in a letter to folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand suggested that the scam actually makes more sense if the two parties — the young person and the older person — are in cahoots from the start. It may indeed be more plausible, but it takes most of the air out of the narrative, which, at least in the version above, builds to and culminates in the younger person's realization that she's be had.

"HIV+ Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/abraham-sands.htm","2014-12-16 12:51:18","  By David Emery
  Viral alert warns that evildoers are exposing innocent victims to the AIDS virus by attaching HIV-contaminated needles to gas pump handles.
  Description: Internet hoax Circulating since: June 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by R. Anderson, June 13, 2000:
  Please read and forward to anyone you know who drives.
  My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.
  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months.
  We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.
  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.
  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.
  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  2013 version via social media: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 26, 2013:
  HIV/AIDS Needles hidden under gas pumps
  In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIC positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
  Analysis: Not to worry. On June 20, 2000, mere days after the overwrought warning above first slammed inboxes across the Internet, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department issued a press release declaring it a hoax.
  'The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has had no reports of such incidents and there is no 'Capt. Abraham Sands' at the JSO,' the statement said. Nor had any such incidents been reported elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, according to the CDC, there are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted via needle-sticks in non-health care settings, ever (see statement below).
  The viral warning was, and is, entirely fictitious.
  It did add an interesting new wrinkle to the HIV needle-stick rumors already circulating online in various forms since 1997. Previous variants warned of tainted syringes planted in movie theater seats and pay phone coin slots , not to mention random 'stealth prickings' (for lack of a better phrase) in night clubs and other crowded public places. Now we have tainted needles on the handles of gas pumps to contend with. Where will they turn up next?
  Copycat pranks
  All these variants have been investigated and deemed false by authorities with the sole exception of a spate of apparent copycat pranks that occurred around the beginning of 1999 in western Virginia. According to police there, actual hypodermic needles were found in the coin slots of public phones and bank night deposit slots in a couple of small towns in the area. None were found to be contaminated with HIV or any other biological agent. Presumably the pranksters were imitating rumors that had already been circulating online for months.
  Groundless though it may be, the conviction that unknown assailants are intentionally spreading AIDS by hiding contaminated needles in public places remains popular, especially on the email forwarding circuit. One reason is that these tales and other urban legends like them provide an outlet for unspoken fears — of strangers, of the motives of some of the more marginal members of society, of AIDS itself. They're cautionary tales , albeit ones that don't really function as such — not literally, at any rate — in that they fail to address the primary way HIV is actually transmitted: unsafe sex.
  'Pump' at your own risk
  Which raises an interesting point. By virtue of the fact that each of these fictitious scenarios depicts the transmission of HIV via acts of penetration, each works as a metaphor for sex. Consider the claim that one risks exposure to HIV simply by inserting one's finger into the coin slot of a public phone. The imagery isn't pretty, but it's apt.
  Now we're being warned to be careful when pumping gas , to take all due precautions before sliding the nozzle into the tank.
  Sound advice? Metaphorically speaking, yes!
  Statement from the CDC on needle-stick rumors and AIDS:
  Have people been infected with HIV from being stuck by needles in non-health care settings?
  No. While it is possible to get infected with HIV if you are stuck with a needle that is contaminated with HIV, there are no documented cases of transmission outside of a health-care setting.
  CDC has received inquiries about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC 'confirmed' the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to be rumors/myths.

  Here's a tabloid tale of 81-year-old 'gun-toting granny' Ava Estelle of Melbourne, Australia, who purportedly took revenge on two men who raped her granddaughter by shooting their testicles off.
  It's a marvelous story without a shred of truth. The tale of 'gun-toting granny' Ava Estelle of Melbourne, Australia began circulating via email in 2000 a couple of years after it was first published in the Weekly World News , an American tabloid newspaper famous for its entertaining though factually-challenged content.
  An early Usenet posting of the story dated Feb. 7, 2000 contained a link (now defunct) to a reprint of the original text on the WWN website. The original title of the piece, which Aussie readers were quick to recognize as fake because it's heavily laden with American slang, was 'Granbo.'
  The Ava Estelle story is still being passed around as factual, though long since debunked as an Internet urban legend .
  A latter-day variant sports the tagline, 'Deport her to America — we need her!'
  Here's email text contributed by L. Palmer on Feb. 9, 2000:
  MELBOURNE, Australia -- Gun-toting granny Ava Estelle, 81, was so ticked-off when two thugs raped her 18-year-old granddaughter that she tracked the unsuspecting ex-cons down -- and shot their testicles off!
  'The old lady spent a week hunting those bums down and when she found them, she took revenge on them in her own special way,' said admiring Melbourne police investigator Evan Delp.
  'Then she took a taxi to the nearest police station, laid the gun on the sergeant's desk and told him as calm as could be: 'Those bastards will never rape anybody again, by God.''
  Cops say convicted rapist and robber Davis Furth, 33, lost both his penis and his testicles when outraged Ava opened fire with a 9mm pistol in the seedy hotel room where he and former prison cellmate Stanley Thomas, 29, were holed up.
  The wrinkled avenger also blew Thomas' testicles to kingdom come, but doctors managed to save his mangled penis, police said.
  'The one guy, Thomas, didn't lose his manhood, but the doctor I talked to said he won't be using it the way he used to,' Detective Delp told reporters. 'Both men are still in pretty bad shape, but I think they're just happy to be alive after what they've been through.'
  The Rambo Granny swung into action August 21 after her granddaughter Debbie was carjacked and raped by two knife-wielding creeps in a section of town bordering on skid row.
  'When I saw the look on my Debbie's face that night in the hospital, I decided I was going to go out and get those bastards myself 'cause I figured the police would go easy on them,' recalled the retired library worker. 'And I wasn't scared of them, either because I've got me a gun and I've been shootin' it all my life.'
  Using a police artist's sketch of the suspects and Debbie's description of the sickos' car, tough-as-nails Ava spent seven days prowling the wino-infested neighborhood where the crime took place till she spotted the ill-fated rapists entering their flophouse hotel. 'I knew it was them the minute I saw 'em, but I shot a picture of 'em anyway and took it back to Debbie and she said sure as hell, it was them,' the ornery oldster recalled.
  'So I went back to that hotel and found their room and knocked on the door -- and the minute the big one, Furth, opened the door, I shot 'em got right square between the legs, right where it would really hurt 'em most, you know. Then I went down to the police station and turned myself in.'
  Now, baffled lawmen are tying to figure out how to deal with the vigilante granny. 'What she did was wrong, but you can't really throw an 81-year-old woman in prison' Det. Delp said, 'especially when all 3 million people in the city want to nominate her for sainthood.'

  Also known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag,' 'The Knife in the Briefcase,' or 'The Assailant in Disguise'
  Example: As told by Huw Llewelyn-Jones:
  I first heard this story in 1980 in North Wales. I believed it until I was told it again a matter of days later. It is usually told as happening to a friend or relative.
  A young woman returns to her car from a day's shopping. She had parked her car in the town's multi-story car park.
  As she approaches the car she notices someone sitting in the back seat. She cautiously checks the registration plate to see if it is indeed her car, as it is a popular model and color. The car is indeed hers, and as she gets closer she sees that it's an old woman sitting in the back seat.
  She asks the woman how and why she is sitting in her car.
  The old woman replies that she had been shopping with her son and family but felt unwell and returned to the car to rest. She obviously had mistaken the young woman's car for her son's, as it was the same model and color. The old woman then asks to be driven to a hospital, as she is still feeling unwell. The young woman agrees.

  As she gets into the driver's seat something makes her very nervous about the situation and she asks the old woman if she is feeling well enough to direct her as she reverses the car out of the parking place. The old woman agrees, gets out of the car and proceeds to direct the reversing maneuver.
  As soon as the young woman has the car out of the parking space she speeds out of the car park, leaving the old woman stranded. She then drives straight to the nearest police station and reports the incident.
  A police officer then searched the car and found an axe concealed under the driver's seat.
  The young woman had had a lucky escape!
  Analysis: The tale of hairy-armed hitchhiker goes back to the early 1800s in England. In those days, the disguised axe murderer was said to have awaited his victim in the back seat of a horse-drawn carriage. More recently the legend has resurfaced with the malefactor posing as good samaritan whose briefcase just happens to be stuffed with deadly weapons.
  Two hundred years old and still going strong, proof that a great story never dies.

"The Hook","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the_hook.htm","2016-05-30 23:50:03","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Hook Man'
  A teenage boy drove his date to a dark and deserted lovers' lane for a make-out session. He turned on the radio for mood music, leaned over to whisper in the girl's ear, and began kissing her.
  Minutes later, the mood was broken when the music suddenly stopped mid-song. After a moment of silence an announcer's voice came on, warning in an ominous tone that a convicted murderer had just escaped from the state insane asylum — which happened to be located within a half-mile of where they were parked — and urging that anyone who notices a man wearing a stainless steel hook in place of his missing right hand should immediately report his whereabouts to the police.
  The girl became frightened and asked to be taken home. The boy, feeling bold, locked all the doors instead and, assuring his date they would be safe, attempted to kiss her again. She became frantic and pushed him away, insisting that they leave. Relenting, the boy peevishly jerked the car into gear and spun its wheels as he pulled out of the parking space.

  When they arrived at the girl's house she got out of the car, and, reaching to close the door, began to scream uncontrollably. The boy ran to her side to see what was wrong and there, dangling from the door handle, was a bloody hook.
  Analysis: Folks have been telling the hook-man story since the 1950s, and indeed the implicit moral message — 'Sex is naughty; bad boys and girls will be punished!' — seems more appropriate to that simpler, more naive era. Just as this message has come to be parodied in recent horror films (whereas, once upon a time, it was delivered with morbid solemnity), its 'bygone' relevance has taken the teeth out of the cautionary tale .
  Remarking on the improbable tidiness of the plot of 'The Hook,' folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand observed that 'most tellers narrate the story nowadays more as a scary story than a believed legend.' Small wonder. Given its exploitation by Hollywood in popular genre films like Candyman and I Know What You Did Last Summer , most people under the age of 30 probably assume the story was invented by screenwriters.
  Folklorists of a more Freudian bent find meaningful sexual overtones in the imagery of the tale. The boy, who wants to get his 'hooks' into the girl, is not only frustrated by her unwillingness but afraid of his own lustful impulses — a fear heightened by the stern 'voice of conscience' emitting from the radio — and has to 'pull out fast' before a deadly sin is committed. The tearing off of the madman's hook symbolizes castration. Proponents of this type of psychological interpretation find the sexual apprehensions of both boys and girls represented in the legend.
  One of the earliest appearances of 'The Hook' in print was in a 'Dear Abby' column dated Nov. 8, 1960:
  DEAR ABBY: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me:
  A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite 'lovers' lane' to listen to the radio and do a little necking. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple became frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the car door for her. Then he saw — a hook on the door handle! I don't think I will ever park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids.
  Not all urban legends in this vein have a safe and happy ending, I should point out. See ' The Boyfriend's Death ' for an example of a similar cautionary tale that pulls no punches. If you dare...

  HALLOWEEN WARNING PLEASE READ!!!!
  There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks. It smells like strawberry also and it is being handed out to kids in school yards in AR. I'm sure it will make its way around the country. Kids are ingesting this thinking it is candy and being rushed off to the ER in dire condition.
  It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange. It looks just like pop rocks.
  Please instruct children to not accept candy that looks like this even from a friend and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc.
  Pass this around it could save some family a lot of heartache!
  They call it strawberry meth or strawberry quick.

  Analysis: I contacted Special Agent Todd V. Coleman of Homeland Security, whose signature appears on the above message, and asked him if he authored it. He said no. Like everyone else, he said, he received it as a forwarded message and made the mistake of passing it to a colleague for verification. Once sent, it was 'forwarded a million times over and posted on MySpace with my info attached to it,' Coleman wrote.
  He added that he had since received 'intel' to the effect that it isn't really true.
  We've seen similar warnings before. Beginning in January 2007, drug enforcement officers in various parts of the U.S. began reporting sightings of pink, strawberry-flavored crystal meth during routine drug busts.
  According to DEA public affairs officer Barbara Wetherell, however, as of October 2008 the agency has found zero evidence to substantiate that Strawberry Quick or any other form of flavored methamphetamine actually exists.
  'This is an urban myth,' she told Columbus Local News in a story published Oct. 31, 2008. 'We surveyed all of our offices yesterday (Oct. 30) and we found nothing. This is just one of those emails.'

"Weird Text Messages","http://paranormal.about.com/od/poltergeists/a/tales_10_12_13t.htm","2016-01-30 02:32:14","  I am 28 years old. I live in Washington D.C. and I've had an assortment of weird things happen to me. There are many haunted houses and areas in this location. It's very fun, especially for me since I have such a great interest in the paranormal.
  The incident I'm about to share happened a few weeks ago. It isn't as scary as it is alarming and peculiar and definitely wasn't very 'fun' for me at all.
  I was lounging around at home by myself, watching televison, when I got this text message on my phone, 'Linzy i c u.' from a number I wasn't familiar with. I knew nobody could see where I was (on my bed in my upstairs bedroom with the shades drawn.) But I instinctively looked around anyway and even peered out the window. Nobody was around. It was a cold, blustery day so there weren't many people out and about anyway.
  I texted back, 'Who is this???'
  The reply was,'Just a friend.
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  sum1 who watches ur every move. ur lil guardian angle.'
  Now I knew it wasn't a friend because none of my friends text like that and they all know how to spell. None of them would have spelled the word ' angel ' wrong. And so I texted, 'You're no friend of mine if you can't spell my name right and you can't even spell the word ANGEL correctly.'
  The response was, 'doesnt matter. r u havin fun watchin ur tv?' This gave me chills. Who would be watching me? There was nobody around, unless this person was in the house. So I ran around checking the doors and windows and other rooms,even the garage. I was definately the only one there.
  I settled down in the family room and texted back, 'If you don't tell me who you are, i am calling 911.'
  The reply was, 'Good luck with that. I am standing right next 2 u but nobody will ever find me.'
  I stupidly looked behind me. Of course nobody was there, but by this time I was getting pretty freaked. I grabbed the house phone and dialed the number the texter was from. It was what I feared: an automated answering service stated, 'We're sorry but the number you have dialed is not in service.'
  I tried telling myself that maybe the texter didn't have minutes or something. There HAD to be a logical explanation for this -- someone was just playing a sick prank on me.
  Then I get this text, 'I love ur new blond hair.'
  I had just gotten my hair done for my 28th birthday a few days prior to this. Few people had seen it and not even most of my friends had seen it. I hadn't even had an updated picture yet on my Facebook wall. By this point, I'm panicking pretty badly and I am close to tears.
  So I did the most rational thing I could think of -- I called 911. The operator tried calming me down after I explained that I thought someone was in my house and was somehow sending me threatening text messages on an unidentified number. The operator said that they'd send someone over to investigate.
  Right after hanging up, I get this: 'Linzy why did you have to do that?'
  'do what?' I texted back.
  'U kno what u did.' came the reply.
  'No i am sorry but I don't know what this is in reference to.' I texted back, hoping that the texter would think I wasn't as scared as I felt.
  'Linzy, nobody is goin 2 help u. nobody is goin 2 beleve u.'
  'Why wouldn't they?' i texted back, the fear mounting.
  'cuz i cannot be found. you will only disapoint..like u always do.'
  The texter was starting to get personal and was only upsetting me more.
  'Where are you, you stupid psycho stalker!' I texted back, enraged.
  'Aw lindzy that wasnt nice.'
  'WHO ARE YOU!!!'
  'U will c. someday.'
  There was a sudden knock on the door and I about jumped out of my skin. The officer was here. It was an officer I am familiar with and we have actually become semi-friends over the years. He checked out the house and told me what I already knew: nobody was here.
  Then I showed him the text messages and he took down the number and said they would try everything they could to find out who this person was. In the meantime, he said, just turn your phone off. So I did.
  And I honestly haven't gotten anymore weird texts like that again. I haven't heard anything from the police station either, though and I am hoping they didn't think the whole thing was a prank put on by me.
  People talk about weird phone calls they've gotten on this site, but as technology progresses, it seems like the paranormal progresses along with it and is finding new ways to contact and connect to us.

"Is This How to Detect a Two-Way Mirror?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/two_way_mirror.htm","2016-04-16 17:23:38","  A viral message circulating on the Internet purports to give practical tips on how to tell a two-way mirror from an ordinary one.
  Description: Viral message Circulating since: May 1999 Status: Partly true (details below)
  Example: Forwarded email contributed by a reader, May 12, 1999:
  Analysis by Peter Kohler: I'll tell you straightaway that, despite the overemphatic tone used in the above text (which is of course what keeps it in circulation), the fingernail test does work as described in most situations. But allow me to clear up a few fuzzy points involved, as well as suggest several other possible ways to identify a two-way mirror.
  Some companies in the window glass and mirror trade call them ' two-way mirrors ' and some call them ' one-way mirrors ' — don't ask me why; there seems to be no distinction between the two names. They both refer to a product known as Mirropane . Promotional literature from the LOF Architectural Specialty Glass company states that the product registered under the name 'Mirropane E.P. Transparent Mirror' is 'formed using LOF's patented chemical vapor deposition process on 1/4' Grey tint glass.' As to exactly how that works or even what reflective metal is involved, it seems to be a trade secret, although the good folks at Morehouse Glass in Portland, Oregon suggest that tin or nickel are the likeliest choices.
  It's probably not silver, as suggested in the missive under scrutiny. The product can be heat-treated for maximum strength and can also be laminated to make it scratch resistant (so if, say, some nut decided to use this product for a mirror in a changing room, it would not be easily scratched by a belt buckle or other light brushings-up-against).
  The product can also be made considerably bullet-proof, in case you are thinking about buying some for the watchtower in the maximum security prison you've just had built.
  Sure enough, Mirropane is treated on the 'subject' or first surface of the glass, and the recommended lighting ratio for surveillance purposes is 10:1, with the subject side being ten times brighter than the observer side. The fingernail test described above works for the very reason stated, namely that there is no glass between an object and the reflective surface if the mirror is touched. There are other first-surface mirrors as well that are not two-way, but these are used primarily in precision optical instruments or in scientific experiments using lasers, where the refraction from the glass would be an interference. Mirropane is commonly used in prisons and police stations, in psychological observation rooms and in security situations which can include many types of businesses where viewing customers or employees is deemed necessary or desirable.
  Here are some other ways to identify Mirropane from an ordinary, second-surface mirror .
  This from William Beaty, electrical engineer, Seattle: '... simply turn the lights off in [the] room, then place a bright flashlight against the mirror surface. If there is a hidden chamber behind the mirror, the flashlight will illuminate it, and since you're in a darkened room, you'll see the hidden chamber.'
  A deputy from the Washington County Police Department in Oregon concurs, and suggests that even a pen-light will work for this test, though not nearly as well. He further suggests that, if you are in a room (such as a changing room) where you cannot turn off the lights on your side, if you hold your eyes near to the glass surface and cup your hands around them on either side to eliminate most of the light from your visual field, you ought to be able to see through the treated glass, as Mirropane will permit about a 12 percent passage of light (from the lit side to the hidden chamber, if there is one).
  Douglas Brown, a part-time field researcher and writer who also works for Powell's Books, Inc. in Portland, Oregon, has some clever advice to share. He makes the point that there is a clear auditory difference between Mirropane and regular mirrors, because of how they are installed. Rap on the surface with your knuckle or fingernail, he says, and in most situations you'll be able to hear the difference in the sound produced. Ordinary mirrors have backing material which will dull the sound, while windows have open air behind them and will reverberate more.
  Along similar lines, when the text asks 'how many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror, or actually a two-way mirror?' those employees of Morehouse Glass make the point that any mirror hung in front of a wall will be a mirror plain and simple, because Mirropane will be a pane of glass installed into the wall like any other window, and will have window framing evident, not mirror glass molding around it.
  For those who will remain nervous Nellies from here until breakfast:
  This article is not meant to be encyclopedic. We'll leave that to the special effects department. Common sense would seem to dictate, however, that one be clear about where and why one is undressing in any potentially semi-private place, rather than concerning oneself with who may be watching.
  Birthday suits are, after all, just birthday suits.

"The Kidney Thieves","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/kidney_thieves.htm","2017-01-06 16:49:09","  By David Emery
  No one knows why, but in 1997 a mind contagion broke out in New Orleans. As the city geared up for its annual Mardi Gras festivities in January, a rumor began spreading via word-of-mouth, fax, and forwarded email to the effect that a highly organized crime ring in New Orleans was carrying out plans to drug visiting tourists, surgically remove healthy kidneys from their bodies, and sell the organs on the black market.
  The viral message , which most often arrived under the header 'Travelers Beware,' sparked an avalanche of phone calls to local authorities, prompting the New Orleans Police Department to publish an official statement to calm public fears. Investigators found no substantiating evidence.
  The story had a familiar ring. Before New Orleans, people said it happened in Houston; before Houston, Las Vegas — where an unsuspecting tourist was drugged in his hotel room by a prostitute and woke up the next morning, supposedly, in a bathtub full of ice, minus a kidney.
  continue reading below our video
  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  It's a scenario that has taken many forms. You may have heard it from a friend who'd heard it from another friend, whose mother swore it had happened to a distant cousin.
  In one version, the victim — we'll call him 'Bob' — was on a business trip alone somewhere in Europe, and went out to a bar one night to have a cocktail. Wouldn't you know it, he woke up the next morning in an unfamiliar hotel room with severe pain in his lower back. He was taken to the emergency room, where doctors determined that, unbeknownst to himself, Bob had undergone major surgery the night before. One of his kidneys had been removed, cleanly and professionally.
  A chilling tale, and a dubious one. With minor variations, the same story has been told thousands of times by thousands of different people in many different locales. And it's always based on third-, fourth-, or fifth-hand information. It's an urban legend .
  The case for the existence of an international black market organ trade has become increasingly convincing in recent years. What remains unsubstantiated are the tales of 'back room' organ thefts perpetrated in the dark of night in seedy hotel rooms or secluded alleyways.
  'There is absolutely no evidence of such activity ever occurring in the U.S. or any other industrialized country,' says the United Network for Organ Sharing. 'While the tale sounds credible enough to some listeners, it has no basis in the reality of organ transplantation.'
  In fact, it's all but impossible for such activities to take place outside properly-equipped medical facilities, UNOS argues. The removal, transport, and transplantation of human organs involves procedures so complex and delicate, requiring a sterile setting, minute timing, and the support of so many highly-trained personnel, that they simply could not be accomplished on the street.
  The National Kidney Foundation has repeatedly issued requests for alleged victims of such crimes to come forward and validate their stories. To date, none have.
  Even so, like so many urban legends fueled by irrational fear and ignorance, the organ theft story continues to spread from person to person and place to place, changing and adapting to its surroundings over time like a mutating virus.
  Unlike many other urban legends , unfortunately, this one has put real people's lives at risk. A decade or so ago, rumors began spreading in Guatemala to the effect that Americans were kidnapping local children in order to harvest their organs for transplantation in the United States. In 1994, several U.S. citizens and Europeans were attacked by mobs who believed the rumors to be true. An American woman, Jane Weinstock, was severely beaten and remains critically impaired.
  Closer to home, charitable organizations dedicated to facilitating and funding organ transplants are concerned that tales of black marketeering may be at least partially responsible for a reduction in the ranks of volunteer donors, resulting in needless deaths among seriously ill patients awaiting transplants.
  Contagion is an apt metaphor here. Tracing the spread of this pernicious rumor and the fear that it engenders, we see that acts as a sort of mind-virus, adapting to new environments as it jumps from host to host — even reaching epidemic proportions when conditions are right.
  This way of looking at the propagation of urban legends comes from the discipline of memetics, which investigates the properties of 'memes,' or 'units of cultural transmission.' Other examples of memes are songs, ideas, fashions, and commercial slogans. Think of cultures as 'meme pools' — comparable to the 'gene pools' discussed in biological evolution — and think of memes as informational entities that replicate and evolve in order to survive.
  One thing the longevity of the kidney theft tale makes clear is that a meme need not be true to be fit for survival. What it must — and in this case, certainly does — have are traits that consistently induce one host to communicate the meme to another.
  One such trait is its ability, like a good ghost story, to spark a visceral tingle of fear in the listener. This is probably, in fact, among the strongest characteristics a meme can have; for fear induces stress and one way we as human beings attempt to cope with stress is by distributing it among our peers. On the darker side, there is undeniably a sensation of power to be had by successfully provoking fear in others. Some people actually take a perverse pleasure in it.
  Someone, we don't know who, initiated the cavalcade of faxes, emails and phone calls in early 1997 that caused panic among prospective travelers to New Orleans. It's hard to imagine what the rumormonger's motivation was, if not to share a feeling of panic. In succeeding, he or she induced others to do the same. An epidemic was born.
  The best remedy is accurate information. But remember, viruses adapt in order to survive, and this one has proven to be especially flexible and resilient. We can expect a new strain to show up in due time, in a brand-new environment in which it can flourish and with some compelling new twist to keep it fresh. We can't predict where it will happen, nor can we do much to prevent it. The best we can do, we 'epidemiologists of culture,' is watch and learn, and share what we know. The rest is up to the vagaries of human nature, and the natural selection of memes.

"HIV+ Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/needle_stick.htm","2014-12-16 12:51:18","  By David Emery
  Viral alert warns that evildoers are exposing innocent victims to the AIDS virus by attaching HIV-contaminated needles to gas pump handles.
  Description: Internet hoax Circulating since: June 2000 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by R. Anderson, June 13, 2000:
  Please read and forward to anyone you know who drives.
  My name is Captain Abraham Sands of the Jacksonville, Florida Police Department. I have been asked by state and local authorities to write this email in order to get the word out to car drivers of a very dangerous prank that is occurring in numerous states.
  Some person or persons have been affixing hypodermic needles to the underside of gas pump handles. These needles appear to be infected with HIV positive blood. In the Jacksonville area alone there have been 17 cases of people being stuck by these needles over the past five months.
  We have verified reports of at least 12 others in various states around the country. It is believed that these may be copycat incidents due to someone reading about the crimes or seeing them reported on the television. At this point no one has been arrested and catching the perpetrator(s) has become our top priority.
  Shockingly, of the 17 people who where stuck, eight have tested HIV positive and because of the nature of the disease, the others could test positive in a couple years.
  Evidently the consumers go to fill their car with gas, and when picking up the pump handle get stuck with the infected needle. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CAREFULLY CHECK THE HANDLE of the gas pump each time you use one. LOOK AT EVERY SURFACE YOUR HAND MAY TOUCH, INCLUDING UNDER THE HANDLE.
  If you do find a needle affixed to one, immediately contact your local police department so they can collect the evidence.

  2013 version via social media: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 26, 2013:
  HIV/AIDS Needles hidden under gas pumps
  In Florida and other places on the East Coast a group of people are putting HIV/AIDS infected and filled needles underneath gas pump handles so when someone reaches to pick it up and put gas in their car, they get stabbed with it. 16 people have been a victim of this crime so far and 10 tested HIC positive. Instead of posting that stupid crap about how your love life will suck for years to come of you don't re-post, post this. It's important to inform people, even if you don't drive, a family member might, and what if they were next? CHECK UNDER THE HANDLE BEFORE YOU GRAB IT!!! IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE!
  Analysis: Not to worry. On June 20, 2000, mere days after the overwrought warning above first slammed inboxes across the Internet, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Department issued a press release declaring it a hoax.
  'The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has had no reports of such incidents and there is no 'Capt. Abraham Sands' at the JSO,' the statement said. Nor had any such incidents been reported elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, according to the CDC, there are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted via needle-sticks in non-health care settings, ever (see statement below).
  The viral warning was, and is, entirely fictitious.
  It did add an interesting new wrinkle to the HIV needle-stick rumors already circulating online in various forms since 1997. Previous variants warned of tainted syringes planted in movie theater seats and pay phone coin slots , not to mention random 'stealth prickings' (for lack of a better phrase) in night clubs and other crowded public places. Now we have tainted needles on the handles of gas pumps to contend with. Where will they turn up next?
  Copycat pranks
  All these variants have been investigated and deemed false by authorities with the sole exception of a spate of apparent copycat pranks that occurred around the beginning of 1999 in western Virginia. According to police there, actual hypodermic needles were found in the coin slots of public phones and bank night deposit slots in a couple of small towns in the area. None were found to be contaminated with HIV or any other biological agent. Presumably the pranksters were imitating rumors that had already been circulating online for months.
  Groundless though it may be, the conviction that unknown assailants are intentionally spreading AIDS by hiding contaminated needles in public places remains popular, especially on the email forwarding circuit. One reason is that these tales and other urban legends like them provide an outlet for unspoken fears — of strangers, of the motives of some of the more marginal members of society, of AIDS itself. They're cautionary tales , albeit ones that don't really function as such — not literally, at any rate — in that they fail to address the primary way HIV is actually transmitted: unsafe sex.
  'Pump' at your own risk
  Which raises an interesting point. By virtue of the fact that each of these fictitious scenarios depicts the transmission of HIV via acts of penetration, each works as a metaphor for sex. Consider the claim that one risks exposure to HIV simply by inserting one's finger into the coin slot of a public phone. The imagery isn't pretty, but it's apt.
  Now we're being warned to be careful when pumping gas , to take all due precautions before sliding the nozzle into the tank.
  Sound advice? Metaphorically speaking, yes!
  Statement from the CDC on needle-stick rumors and AIDS:
  Have people been infected with HIV from being stuck by needles in non-health care settings?
  No. While it is possible to get infected with HIV if you are stuck with a needle that is contaminated with HIV, there are no documented cases of transmission outside of a health-care setting.
  CDC has received inquiries about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC 'confirmed' the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to be rumors/myths.

  Drug users are now taking their used needles and putting them into the coin return slots in public telephones. People are putting their fingers in to recover coins or just to check if anyone left change. They are getting stuck by these needles and infected with hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. This message is posted to make everyone aware of this danger. Be aware! The change isn't worth it!
  P.S. - This information came straight from phone company workers, through the EMT instructor. This did NOT come from a hearsay urban legend source.
  Example #2:
  A weird story crossed my desk and thought I'd pass it along.
  A friend-of-a-friend is currently going through EMT class and they've been warned (told) to be very careful reaching into any slot for return change. I guess the latest 'thing' is placing used hypodermic needles into change-return slots, causing people to get pricked when they reach in for their change. These needles are showing up primarily at public pay phones, but obviously it could spread easily and quickly (e.g. stamp machines, vending machines, etc).
  Please be careful. Thanks for your attention.
  Example #3:
  According to a Singaporean Tan Kim Leng, recently many people were reported sick (diseases like Hepatitis B, Aids, etc.) after being poked by a needle, what happened is this. Some cruel, sickening people would place an infected needle or pin inside the little compartment of the public telephone where you get the return change, (the opening with a flipping metal door where you put your fingers in to get back your remaining coins after you used the public phone) and this is how you get in touch with the needle and you get infected. Many cases had been reported, I mean many severe cases. Quite a number of the employee of Singapore Telecom (those who went round to collect the coins in the public phones were infected too). As far as we know, it has not been announced publicly, but very soon they would. Just be more careful if you really need to use the public phones, you may use, but insert the exact amount, otherwise, just forego those changes, I'm sure your life worth much more than these. Remember to spread this piece of information to as many people as possible, especially to your children and the elderly at home or those who do not have a cellular phone.
  By the way, Tan Kim Leng is heading the Jurong Branch Police Station in Singapore, if you watch the Singapore news tonight, you probably would have seen him on TV.
  This is a true incident that happened in Jarkata & Singapore discovered by a doctor. Sooner or later it will spread over the region including Hong Kong & Taiwan as well. So, please be alert with public phones and beware of aids !!
  Analysis: It's scary, sounds authoritative, and is replicating in every part the world at this very moment. Is it an urban legend? Yes.
  
  Moreover, the fact that more than one version is circulating demonstrates that anonymous senders are altering the text at will. As is the case with most such email alerts, the information they contain is inherently unreliable.
  Ah, but is it true ?
  No. As of this writing, no actual cases have been documented. (Note: see update on apparent copycat incidents in Virginia.)
  Which is not to say that an incident of the kind described may not have happened somewhere, sometime. Odds are it has occurred at least once, though I've been unable to locate a single news report anywhere to substantiate that.
  What renders the rumor incredible as a whole is the implication that the placing of used needles in coin return slots is a common occurrence and that everyone, everywhere is endangered by it.
  Are we to believe that a worldwide junkie convention took place wherein it was decided that public phones are the new needle disposal receptacle of choice? Was a resolution passed that instead of throwing away entire syringes (which won't fit into a coin return slot), all needles must henceforth be purposely detached and secreted somewhere where they can harm others?
  Not likely.
  Furthermore, what's the motive? Are we to think that drug addicts are a malicious and hateful lot by nature? There's no good reason to suppose it. Sure, they're notoriously irresponsible; sure, they're often found to be involved in criminal activities beyond using illegal drugs; but it doesn't follow that we should expect them to commit random acts of evil.
  Though absurd in its specifics, the rumor echoes on a deeper level the conviction most of us have that the world is not as safe and sane a place as it used to be. It supplies anecdotal 'evidence' to support a growing trend toward fear and distrust of strangers, particularly those who live on the seemier margins of society. Although the rumor was unfounded when it first erupted, reports of copycat incidents (Feb. 1999) now lend it an unfortunate after-the-fact credibility and nourish that underlying sense of insecurity. The dividing line between paranoia and prudent caution becomes harder and harder to discern.

"Social Security Warns of ID Theft Scams","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Jury-Duty-Scam-Warning.htm","2016-10-13 10:40:11","  By Robert Longley
  Almost 70 million Americans depend on Social Security benefits . Sadly, whether you are already receiving benefits or not, your Social Security account is a tempting target for scammers. The sheer complexity of this mainline federal assistance program makes Social Security accounts particularly vulnerable to hacking by cyber attackers. As a result, the Social Security Administration has identified some particularly dangerous scams you should be aware of whether you are already receiving benefits or plan to in the future.
  The Social Security Administration (SSA) strongly urges all current and future beneficiaries to set up a personal “My Social Security” account on its website at SSA.gov . Having a My Social Security account, allows you to check the size of your current or future benefits and change your bank account direct deposit information or mailing address without having to visit your local Social Security office or wait on hold to speak to an agent.
  The bad news is that scammers also take advantage of many My Social Security accounts.
  In this bit of awful, scammers set up My Social Security accounts in the names of people who do not already have them, thus allowing them to transfer the victims’ current or future benefits to their own bank accounts or debit cards. While Social Security will reimburse victims of this scam, it can take months and leave you without benefits during that period.
  Scammers can only set up a bogus My Social Security account in your name if they already know your Social Security Number and other personal information, which in today’s data-breach-of-the-week environment is all too likely. So, the thing to do is set up your account as soon as possible. Anyone over age 18 can set up a My Social Security account. Even if you do not intend to start drawing benefits for years, a My Social Security account can be a valuable retirement planning tool. When you set up your account, be sure to choose the “Add Extra Security” option on the online signup form. This option will cause a new security code to be sent to your cell phone or email ever time you try to access your account. You will need to enter the code in order to log on. It is sort of inconvenient, but far better than having your benefits stolen.
  [ Risks and Benefits of Taking Social Security at 62 ]
  This a whole set of scams in which the perpetrator -- posing as a Social Security “agent” -- calls victims regarding their benefits. For example, the scammer may claim the SSA needs to verify the victim’s direct deposit information. In another more complex scam, the victim is told that their Social Security benefits are being cut because they have inherited a house from a relative; an event that would not result in a reduction of their Social Security benefit. To help perpetrate the fraud, the caller then places the recipient on hold and plays the same on-hold recordings actually used by Social Security. When the scammer comes back on the line, the victim is that told proceeds from the sale of the house will be sent to them if they pay the back taxes. Of course, there are no inherited houses or back taxes.
  The SSA recommends taking extreme precautions before giving out personal information. “You should never provide your Social Security number or other personal information over the telephone unless you initiated the contact, or are confident of the person to whom you are speaking,” says the agency. “If in doubt, do not release information without first verifying the validity of the call.” Which you can do by calling Social Security’s toll free number at 1-800-772-1213 to verify the legitimacy of the call. (If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call Social Security's TTY number at 1-800-325-0778.) Also be aware that scammers have also perfected the black cyber crime art of “ caller ID spoofing ,” so even if your caller ID says, “Social Security Administration,” it is probably just another scammer.
  Given the number of actual government data breaches these days, this scam is particularly believable and dangerous. The scammer – again pretending to work for Social Security – tells the victim that the agency’s computers have been hacked. In order find out if the victim's account has been compromised, the scammer says he needs to verify that the SSA has the victim’s correct bank account information. To set the hook, the scammer gives the victim account information he knows is incorrect. In the end, the victim is tricked into giving the scammer their correct bank account information. Bad, very bad.
  The SSA recommends ignoring calls and emails regarding account data breaches. The agency never initiates contact with beneficiaries by phone or email. Even letters regarding data breaches can be scams as scammers have gotten very good at making envelopes and letters look “official.” If you get such a letter call the real Social Security Administration at 800-772-1213 to find out if the letter is legitimate. If the letter gives any other number to call, do not call it.
  While it hasn’t happened since 2014, Social Security adds a cost of living adjustment (COLA) in most years based on the rate of inflation . But, when there is no increase in the consumer price index (CPI), as was the case in 2015 and 2016, there is no COLA for Social Security recipients. Scammers – again posing as SSA employees -- take advantage of these non-COLA years by calling, emailing or sending letters to victims stating that the SSA had apparently “forgotten” to apply the COLA increase to their accounts. As with other scams, victims are given a form or link to a website where they can “claim” their COLA increase by providing their Social Security Number and bank account information. By now, you know what happens next. Tell your money goodbye.
  Ignore the letters, calls or emails. When and if they are given, Social Security applies COLAs automatically and without fail to the accounts of all current beneficiaries. You never have to “apply” for them.
  In this one, the scammer, again posing as an SSA employee, tells the victim that the agency is replacing all old paper Social Security cards with new high tech, “ID theft proof” computer chips embedded in them. The scammer tells the victim that they will not get any more benefits until they have gotten one of the new cards. The scammer then claims that he can “expedite” the replacement card if the victim provides their identity and bank account details. Clearly not the smart thing to do.
  Ignore the claims. The SSA has plans, desire or money to replace millions of old Social Security cards or to start issuing high-tech cards. In fact, the SSA recommends you not even carry your Social Security card with you do to the threat of identity theft. Instead, memorize your Social Security number and put the card in a safe, secret place.
  The SSA’s office of inspector general asks Americans to report known or suspected incidents of scams. Reports can be submitted online at the SSA’s Report Fraud, Waste or Abuse website.
  Reports can also be submitted by mail to:
  Social Security Fraud Hotline​ P.O. Box 17785 Baltimore, Maryland 21235
  In addition, reports can be submitted by telephone to 1-800-269-0271 from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (TTY: 1-866-501-2101 for the deaf or hard of hearing.)

"The Federal Tax ID Identity Theft 'Phishing' Scam","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/consumerawareness/a/The-Federal-Tax-Id-Phishing-Scam.htm","2016-01-03 11:10:06","  By Robert Longley
  A series of email messages posing as official communications from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are, in fact, dangerous identity theft or ' phishing ' scams attempting to steal the victims' personal and financial information by 'helping' them apply for an IRS Employer Identification Number , or EIN. Among the most popular 'tools' of identity thieves are emails that appear to be from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Face it; anything that says it is from the IRS gets your attention, which is the first goal of email scammers. The following article describes a typical email ' phishing ' scam that attempts to steal your vital personal information by purporting to be from the IRS, and provides information on how the IRS really communicates with taxpayers.
  Typical of this phishing scam is this unsolicited email from 'somebody@IRS.gov,' with the subject 'Rejected Federal Tax payment.' Attention grabbing, isn't it. The body of the email reads as follows:
  continue reading below our video
  How to Request a Federal ID Number
  The letter attempts to convince the victim that they must obtain an IRS Employer Identification Number , or EIN, in order to resolve the non-existent 'Rejected Federal Tax payment.' In reality, EINs are needed only by businesses. Most individual taxpayers are known to the IRS by their Social Security Number (SSN). Individuals may also obtain a Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) from the Social Security Administration, which can be used in place of a Social Security Number. In addition, certain nonresident and resident aliens, their spouses, and dependents that cannot get a Social Security Number can get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the IRS.
  The section of the scam email that begins, 'No need to file a Form SS-4…' is copied directly from the IRS website. Do not click on any website, email or .pdf file links included in the email . The danger of the email is that clicking on any of the links provided by the scammer takes the victim to a website where they will, indeed be asked to provide some of the information required to complete the actual IRS Form SS-4, Application for an Employer Identification Number . However, the answers; such as name, address, Social Security Number and other vital personal and financial information, will be collected by the identity thief, NOT by the IRS. In addition, programs on the scammer's websites may attempt to install ' malware ' on the victim's computer.
  The IRS never sends unsolicited email messages to taxpayers. The IRS never initiates contact with a taxpayer through email, and under no circumstances will the IRS request Social Security Numbers, credit card information or pin numbers through email.
  If you get an unsolicited suspicious email claiming to be from either the IRS or any other IRS-related components such as the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS), the IRS recommends you DO NOT click on any links or attempt to open any attachments and forward the email, as-is to the IRS at: phishing@irs.gov , then delete the original email.

"The Killer in the Backseat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/killer_backseat.htm","2015-09-18 14:38:30","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Emily Dunbar:
  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911 !'

  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.
  The moral of the story: Always check the back seat!
  Analysis: In another common variant of this legend, the imperiled female (and it's always a female, please note) pulls into a gas station and is frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who keeps trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. It turns out he has glimpsed a knife-wielding murderer in the backseat and is trying to save her life!
  Folklorists have traced the legend back to the 1960s and believe it may have been inspired by a vaguely similar real event in 1964 involving the discovery by a New York City policeman of an escaped murderer hiding in the backseat of his (the cop's) own car.
  'The Killer in the Backseat' was among the legendary horror stories dramatized in the 1998 film Urban Legend . Let us not assume, however, that real-life evildoers never lie in wait for their victims in the backseats of vehicles. As reported in the Decatur Daily News on September 14, 2007, a female college student in Alabama was threatened by a man with a gun who popped up suddenly in the backseat of her SUV. She escaped, fortunately, by slamming on the brakes and bolting from the car.

"The Knockout Perfume","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/perfume_scam.htm","2017-01-06 00:57:34","  By David Emery
  A scary story making the Internet rounds since 1999 claims that criminals in the U.S. and elsewhere are using perfume samples spiked with ether or some kind of 'knockout drug' to render victims unconscious before assaulting them and/or stealing their valuables.
  Versions of this urban legend continue to circulate via email and social media. A Twitter message from 2015 is as follows:
  Pls if anyone stops U and ask if you're interested in some perfume and gives u a paper to smell, pls don't! It's a new scam, the paper is laced with drugs. You'll pass out so they can kidnap, rob or do worse things to you. Pls forward to all friends and family..Save a life please. This was received from a Senior police officer this morning. Take note and alert everyone you want to protect. This is not a joke please. Pass on to family and friends. This is from the UK.
  The closest any of these reports has come to being confirmed was the case of Bertha Johnson of Mobile, Alabama , who told police in November 1999 that she was robbed of $800 after sniffing a cologne sample offered by a stranger and subsequently passing out in her car.
  continue reading below our video
  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Toxicological tests revealed no foreign substances in Johnson's blood, however.
  Although the details have morphed over time, more recent versions of the story echo early news reports about the alleged Alabama incident. Instead of cologne, the tainted sample is now said to be perfume. Instead of an unknown soporific substance, the knockout drug is now said to be ether. Interestingly, the main moral message of the story, which was originally 'Beware of parking lot scammers,' has evolved into 'If I hadn't read this warning, I could have been a victim too. And so could you!'
  It's typical for rumors, hoaxes, and urban legends to change as they're passed from person to person (or inbox to inbox). As anyone who has ever played the children's game of 'Telephone' can attest, perception and memory are fallible, and people tend to misremember and/or misreport what they've heard. Moreover, it's in the nature of storytelling (and storytellers) to creatively enhance a yarn to make it more impactful. These processes can be seen at work in the tale of 'The Knock-Out Perfume.'
  On Nov. 8, 1999, the Mobile, Alabama police department issued this press release :
  Local media jumped on the story. A Nov. 10 article in the Mobile Register quoted Johnson as saying that her assailant offered her a $45 bottle of cologne for the bargain price of $8 and talked her into to sniffing a sample. She did, once, and detected nothing odd about the aroma. But when she sniffed it a second time, she said, she lost consciousness. The next thing Johnson knew, she was sitting in another parking lot miles away from where she'd started, dazed, confused, and missing $800 in cash.
  'I feel like I got flimflammed out of something that I should have known better than to even look out the window at her,' Johnson told the Register .
  Within days of the incident, the story of Bertha Johnson's parking lot misadventure was all over the internet.
  Bertha Johnson's firsthand report of her alleged run-in with a cologne scammer inspired an anonymously-written email cautioning all women to beware of parking lot vendors offering samples of cut-rate cologne. While it nailed some of the reported facts correctly, it omitted others completely — the name of the victim, for example, as well as the name of the city in which the incident supposedly happened.
  These omissions may have dampened the email's credibility somewhat. In general, narratives are more believable the more specific they are. But minus some of the particulars the story took on an air of universality as if to say: this could happen to anyone, anywhere, even you , in your hometown.
  Subject: Fwd: Cologne sniffing Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1999 08:54:37 -0600 Watch out - this is for real!!!!!!!
  I just heard on the radio about a lady that was asked to sniff a bottle of perfume that another woman was selling for $8.00. (In a mall parking lot) She told the story that it was her last bottle of perfume that regularly sells for $49.00 but she was getting rid of it for only $8.00, sound legitimate?
  That's what the victim thought, but when she awoke she found out that her car had been moved to another parking area and she was missing all her money that was in her wallet (total of $800.00). Pretty steep for a sniff of perfume!
  Anyway, the perfume wasn't perfume at all, it was some kind of ether or strong substance to cause anyone who breathes the fumes to black out.
  SO beware..... Christmas time is coming and we will be going to malls shopping and we will have cash on us.
  Ladies, please don't be so trusting of others and beware of your surroundings- ALWAYS! Obey your instincts!
  *Please pass this on to your friends, sisters, mothers and all the women in your life you care about....... we can never be too careful!!!!*
  More variants appeared almost instantly, usually localizing the story in places where no such crimes had been reported. One version sent later that same month bore the false preamble, 'This happened in St. Louis.'
  In early December a lengthier version emerged. A woman was approached in a Walmart parking lot by two young men hawking 'designer perfume, it said,' for only $8 a bottle (as in the original version). In this variant the potential victim is said to have declined to sniff the product, and escaped unharmed. Of course, the email strongly urged that it be passed on to to friends, loved ones, and co-workers.
  Subject: Parking lot weirdos This was forwarded to me - you may be interested:
  This is quite strange to hear this story because last month I was approached in the Wal-Mart (on Beckly) parking lot by two young men who were selling designer perfume. They stated that it was the excess of a cosmetic show and it was $8.00. I noticed one young mans distinct accent. I asked him if he was from Kentucky. He replied yes. He asked me if I was sure I didn't want to smell the perfume and I once again said no then got into my car. I did two stupid things. First I spoke/conversed with a stranger at 9:00 at night in a parking lot. Second I allowed a stranger into my space without realizing he was moving closer to me. I was on my guard.
  The Walmart version was still going strong when yet another variant appeared describing yet another new incident, this one having allegedly occurred in the parking lot of a Target store in Plano, Texas. In this rendering, disaster is once again averted when the would-be victim rebuffs the salesman's advances before he even tells her what he's selling. The warning is all the more frightening, however, because it gives the impression that similar crimes are being perpetrated all over the United States.
  In January 2000 someone completely rewrote the text emphasizing the 'close call' scenario and crediting earlier versions of the email with preventing more such crimes from taking place:
  Come April 2000, another report of an incident in a Walmart parking lot is appended to the foregoing version. Note that the two males described in this variant are neither hawking perfume nor asking anyone to sniff a sample. They merely inquire as to the kind of perfume the narrator is wearing:
  I just wanted to pass along that I was approached yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 p.m. in the Walmart parking lot at Forest Drive by 2 males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. I didn't stop to answer them and kept walking toward the store. At the same time I remembered this email. The men continued to stand between parked cars -- I guess to wait on someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going toward them, pointed at them, and told her what they might ask and NOT to let them get near her. When that happened, the men and a lady (I don't know where she came from!) started walking the other way toward their car parked in far corner of the parking lot. I thank Jane Shirey for passing this along -- it might have saved me from a robbery. I'm passing this along to you'all so you can warn the women in your life to watch out for this... Cathy
  This wordy variation, which also appeared in late April 2000, describes yet another close call, though this time the story is completely secondhand. It's set in Kansas City:
  Two weekends ago, Mom, Melody and I were shopping at The Home Place at about 95th & Metcalf and while I was driving around the parking lot looking for the closest parking spot, we saw a man individually approach two single women and speak to them. They both just kept walking and wouldn't have anything to do with him.
  When we got into the store we saw one of the women that he spoke with and so curiosity getting the best of us we went up to her and explained that we'd seen the man approach her in the parking lot and we were wondering what he wanted. She then told us she was so scared that she had to sit down so we found the section with lawn furniture and we all sat down.
  She explained that just a few days prior she had received and e-mail about a man approaching you in a store parking lot asking if you'd like to smell a perfume, explaining that he's got all of the latest fragrances at drastically reduced prices and that he's sure you'll like this one (as he hands you the bottle) you take it and smell it and pass out because it's ether, not perfume. She said that was this man's exact line and that when she saw him pull a bottle out from his jacket, she said don't open that bottle or I'll scream and call the police on my cell phone. Well, we walked her to her car when we were all done shopping so she didn't have to go back out there by herself and we talked about it for a few minutes.
  The knockout perfume legend took the form of an omnibus version in 2000, including a new scenario that supposedly took place at a gas station in Des Moines, Iowa, followed by two of the previous versions.
  I received this email from a friend!
  I was pumping gas at the Texaco station at Merle Hay and Douglas approximately a week and a half ago and a young girl walked up to me and asked if I'd like to sample some perfume scents. She said that they had all the latest fragrances. I looked over at her car which was a turquoise sub-compact and her boyfriend (?) was rooting through the trunk. I declined, saying that I had to get back to work. She said again that they had all the latest scents and it wouldn't take long. I again declined and went inside to pay for my gas. She said, 'Thanks anyway', and went back to her car. When I pulled out, the two were just sitting there in the car. She smiled and waved. I thought it was an odd thing at the time, but the note below really brings it home that it could have been part of this indeed frightening scenario. I don't know WHAT they had in mind, but I can verify that this happened to me here in Des Moines. Please be careful,ladies.
  In true folkloric fashion, not one of the anecdotes you've just read is supported by anything more than hearsay, and anonymous hearsay at that. It doesn't necessarily follow that every report is false, but skepticism is in order.
  The moral message people are conveying by amplifying and spreading this legend is a familiar one, amount really to little more plain old common sense: 'Be careful out there.' That's a good message and a wise policy, but we have to question whether repeating frightful stories with little or no basis in fact is the best way to inspire prudent behavior.
  Urban legends often take the form of cautionary tales, but it would be a mistake to assume that they always actually function as such. Urban legends thrive, mainly, because they're emotionally gripping stories. To the extent that they serve any social purpose at all, it's probably more catharsis than anything — providing a belly laugh when we're blue or a bone-chilling scare to release pent-up tension. Plus, don't forget, there's an all-too-human pleasure to be had by provoking these reactions in others.
  In days gone by, people sat around for hours in the glow of a campfire scaring the pants off one another with horror stories for no other reason than that they enjoyed it. Human nature hasn't changed. We still enjoy scaring each other, only now we do it by the glow of a computer screen instead of a crackling fire.

  Also known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag' or 'The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'
  Example #1 As told by a reader:
  One summer day in Southampton, New York, a woman pulled into a gas station. As the attendant pumped gas, the woman told him she was in a hurry to pick up her daughter, who had just finished an art class in East Hampton.
  A very well-dressed man walked over to her car and started talking to her. He explained that his rental car had died, and he needed a ride to East Hampton for an appointment. She said she would be happy to give him a ride. He put his briefcase in the backseat and said he was going to the men's room quickly.
  The woman looked at her watch and suddenly panicked. She drove off quickly, forgetting that the man was coming back to the car for a ride.
  She thought nothing of him again until she and her daughter pulled into their driveway. She saw his briefcase and realized she had forgotten him! She opened it looking for some form of identification so she could notify him about his belongings. Inside she found nothing but a knife and a roll of duct tape!

  Example #2 As told by a reader:
  A young woman was leaving a local shopping mall, only to find that she had a flat tire. A well-dressed young man carrying a briefcase came up to her and asked if she needed help. She told him she would call AAA, but when she did she was told it would be over an hour before a truck would be dispatched to her site. The gentleman urged her to let him fix her flat and she finally allowed him to do so.
  When he was finished, he asked if she would give him a ride to the other side of the mall, as his car was parked there. Looking at her watch, she realized how late it was and apologized to the young man saying that she needed to get home as it was her daughter's birthday and her husband was at home with the two children awaiting her arrival. The man went on his way.
  When she got home, she told her husband what had happened at the mall and about the man who came to her aid. The husband went out to look at the tire and saw that the man had inadvertently left his briefcase in the trunk of the vehicle. He brought it into the living room and they opened it to see if they could find the man's name and phone number.
  Upon opening the briefcase, they found only five items: a rag, chloroform, duct tape, a body bag and an ice pick (which was probably used to cause the flat tire ).
  Analysis: A newer version of this urban legend dating from 1998 was set in the parking lot of an actual, specific shopping center in Columbus, Ohio, the Tuttle Crossing Mall. According to local police and mall officials, however, no such incident ever took place there.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand refers to the story as 'one of the most common and most fully analyzed of all contemporary legends,' which is partly a function of its age. A variant known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag' (or ' The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker ') dates back to the horse-and-buggy era. In that version, a driver consents to give a ride to an elderly woman who turns out, upon closer examination, to have extremely hairy arms — she's a man in disguise! Justifiably panicked, the driver invents a ruse to get the 'woman' out of his vehicle and speeds off to safety, only to discover a handbag left behind in the passenger seat containing just one item: a hatchet.
  Every variant of this cautionary tale shares the 'close call' motif — the driver, always a lone female, nearly falls into the clutches of a would-be assailant but escapes just in time . In some versions she senses a tell-tale sign of danger — the old woman's man-like arms, for example, or, in the Tuttle Mall variant, the good samaritan's creepy insistence on being driven across the parking lot after he fixes the driver's flat tire. In other versions, including as the ones retold above, the driver escapes due to pure happenstance — she suddenly recalls a pressing appointment and speeds off before the assailant can climb into the car. Either way, the close call is an obligatory narrative turn, else who would be left to (supposedly) tell the tale?

"'New' Car Break-in Method: Hole Under Door Lock","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/Hole-Under-Door-Lock.htm","2016-05-31 04:25:19","  By David Emery
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: 2010 Status: Mixed (details below)
  Viral alert circulating via email and social media warns of a 'new' vehicle break-in method wherein thieves punch a small hole under the handle of a car door to unlock it.
  Example #1: As shared on Facebook, Jan. 5, 2013:
  Hole Under Door Lock
  Wednesday, I approached my truck from the passenger side to place my computer bag in the front passenger seat.
  As I reached to open the door I noticed there was a hole right under my door handle.
  My first thought was, 'someone has shot my truck!'
  I began to think about it and inspect it a little closer and the 'light' slowly began to come on.
  I phoned my friend who owns a body shop and asked if he had any vehicles with damage to the doors that looked like a bullet hole.
  'Yes, I see it all the time. Thieves have a punch and place it right under the door handle, knock a hole through, reach in and unlock it, just as if they have a key. No alarms, broken glass, or anything.'
  I then placed a call to my insurance agent and explained it to him. I was puzzled that they left my GPS and all other belongings.
  Here is where it gets scary!
  'Oh no, he said, they want the break-in to be so subtle that you don't even realize it. They look at your GPS to see where 'home' is. Or check your address from Insurance and Registration in your glove box. Now, they know what you drive, go to your home, and if your vehicle isn't there they assume you aren't and break into your home.'
  He said they will even leave a purse or wallet and only take one or two credit cards. By the time you realize there has been a theft, they may have already had a couple of days or more to use them.
  (I didn't realize my situation for two full days!)
  They even give you the courtesy of re-locking your doors for you.
  Periodically, walk around your car, especially after you park in a shopping center or other large parking area.
  Report thefts immediately....your bank w/missing check numbers, your credit card agencies, police, and insurance companies, etc.

  Analysis: While we have no way of verifying the specifics of this anecdotal account, the 'hole punch' method it describes is known to police and indeed sometimes used in the commission of auto burglaries. Apparently, it works quite well. In a spate of roughly four dozen break-ins reported in Alton, Illinois over a two-month period in 2009, for example, police said at least half involved the use of 'a sharp tool to deftly punch through car doors, just under their locks to release them,' according to a local newspaper, The Telegraph . The report continues:
  The unknown sharp object penetrates the door metal, hits the lock mechanism and disengages it. The burglar or burglars slip inside the vehicle without having to break a window or otherwise heavily damage the car, which would call attention to themselves.
  Because the damage is minor, the owners may not realize they are victims until they notice items missing from the car or items that were moved. The puncture hole that the intruders leave under the lock, usually on the driver's-side door, is only up to about a half-inch in diameter.
  However, while the hole punch technique is referenced in a number of news stories published between 1990 and the present, there were many more instances cited in which cars were burgled the old-fashioned way — by smashing a window.
  Regardless of the method of entry used, precautionary measures available to vehicle owners remain the same: Install a car alarm, avoid parking in dimly lit, isolated places, and never leave valuables (including GPS devices) in plain sight.

  Email example contributed by an AOL user, Feb. 7, 2007:
  This was sent to me and you need to watch it. It's called Lock Bumping. It allows a thief, or anyone, to open your lock in seconds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr23tpWX8lM&eurl= It' a scary thought to know that someone can get into your locked home, where you are feeling safe, and can open your lock and come in.
  Comments: True. The lockpicking method demonstrated in the linked video, variously known as 'lock bumping,' 'key bumping,' and 'bump keying,' isn't new, but it was unknown to the general public (and even to many locksmiths) until 2005, when information about it began circulating on the Internet. Since that time, a plethora of how-to articles, videos, and even do-it-yourself bump key kits have appeared online, resulting in a spate of cautionary news coverage in early 2007. Properly applied, the method can open all but a few of the most common pin tumbler locks in use, including those typically installed on most people's front doors. All it takes is a specially-cut 'bump key' (also known by locksmiths as a '999 key' because all the notches are cut to the maximum depth of 9) and a lightweight mallet for tapping the key into the lock. When the key is slid into the lock and 'bumped,' it momentarily jars all of the tumblers into a position that will allow the bolt to be turned. It's just that easy for someone to break into your home without leaving a trace. How prevalent is lock bumping? But here's the nitty-gritty question: How prevalent is lock bumping, really? At this point no one knows for sure. Police say they don't have statistics on this type of forced entry because it's virtually impossible to tell the difference between a lock that has been bumped and one that was never locked in the first place. There have been few, if any, cases of burglars actually being caught with lock bumping tools in their possession. Even so, the prevailing wisdom seems to be that now that this information has become so readily available, use of the technique by criminals is bound to increase. Can you protect yourself from lock bumping? Yes, but it involves replacing standard locks with higher quality (and much more expensive) bump-resistant models. Consumers are probably best advised to consult a reputable locksmith or security expert for specific recommendations.

  Viral alerts warn of two new techniques allegedly used by criminals to trick drivers into stopping their vehicles: throwing raw eggs at windshields and leaving infant car seats with fake babies in them beside the road. Authorities say these warnings are unfounded.

  2012 example: As shared on Facebook, Sep. 16, 2012:
  A MESSAGE FROM THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL STATE OF MICHIGAN:
  SITUATION... While driving on a rural end of the roadway on Thursday morning, I saw an infant car seat on the side of the road with a blanket draped over it. For whatever reason, I did not stop, even though I had all kinds of thoughts running through my head. But when I got to my destination, I called the Canton PD and they were going to check it out. But, this is what the Police advised even before they went out there to check....
  'There are several things to be aware of ... gangs and thieves are now plotting different ways to get a person (mostly women) to stop their vehicle and get out of the car.
  'There is a gang initiation reported by the local Police Department where gangs are placing a car seat by the road... with a fake baby in it.... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the abandoned baby. 'Note that the location of this car seat is usually beside a wooded or grassy (field) area and the person -- woman -- will be dragged into the woods, beaten and raped, and usually left for dead. If it's a man, they're usually beaten and robbed and maybe left for dead, too.
  DO NOT STOP FOR ANY REASON!!! DIAL 9-1-1 AND REPORT WHAT YOU SAW, BUT DON 'T EVEN SLOW DOWN.
  'IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD, DO NOT STOP TO CHECK THE CAR, DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND DO NOT SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5%, AND YOU ARE THEN FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF THESE CRIMINALS.
  THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY GANGS, SO PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES AND THESE ARE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.' Please talk to your loved ones about this. This is a new tactic used. Please be safe. Get started NOW -- SEND THIS MESSAGE TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO BE CAREFUL AND AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SO AS NOT TO BECOME A VICTIM.

  New Warnings
  FYI, passed along from personnel at the Paulding County Courthouse, in Georgia. Several things to be aware of this year... as gangs and robbers are now plotting different ways to get a person to 'stop' their vehicle.
  Please note: There is a gang initiation reported by the local police department that gangs are placing a car seat by the road ... with a fake baby in it... waiting for a woman, of course, to stop and check on the baby. Note that the location of this car seat will usually be beside a wooded or grassy (field) area ...and the person - woman - will be dragged into the woods - beaten and raped - usually left for dead. DO NOT STOP. DIAL 9-1-1 AND INFORM THEM...
  IF YOU ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND EGGS ARE THROWN AT YOUR WINDSHIELD. DO NOT OPERATE THE WIPER AND SPRAY ANY WATER BECAUSE EGGS MIXED WITH WATER BECOME MILKY AND BLOCK YOUR VISION UP TO 92.5% SO YOU ARE FORCED TO STOP BESIDE THE ROAD AND BECOME A VICTIM OF ROBBERS. THIS IS A NEW TECHNIQUE USED BY ROBBERS. PLEASE INFORM YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.
  2009 example: Email contributed by Steven K., Nov. 18, 2009:
  Fwd: NEW TRICK TO ROB YOU...
  If you are driving at night and eggs are thrown at your windshield.
  Do not operate the wiper and spray any water because eggs mixed with water become milky and block your vision up to 92.5% so you are forced to stop at the roadside and become a victim of robbers.
  This is a new technique used by robbers.
  Please inform your friends and relatives.
  Analysis: These warnings originated as separate messages that were eventually combined into one. We don't know by whom. As you can see from the older examples above, the eggs-on-windshields alert first began circulating, with no mention of babies in car seats, in late 2009. A few months later it was merged with a separate alert ( also circulating since 2009 ) claiming that wannabe gangsters are leaving infant car seats on roadsides to trick drivers into stopping as part of a ' gang initiation ' rite.
  Both warnings were, and are, hoaxes. I've searched for police reports and news stories documenting the use of such tactics by criminals anywhere in the U.S. and found none. Moreover, law enforcement agencies across North America have issued statements dismissing these warnings as fictitious and urging citizens to ignore them (see examples below).

  Analysis: Something for nothing, eh? Just send them your bank account number and they'll gladly share millions of dollars with you? Sure, sure.
  The text quoted above is an example of advance fee fraud (AFF) or, as it has become known internationally, the '419' scam, the number being the section of the Nigerian criminal code having to do with financial fraud schemes. You can find it listed at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission home page and on the FBI's website , both of which offers reliable information about the scam, in addition to addresses and phone numbers where people can report this or any other such scam offers they receive.
  The Nigerian business letter has been around in snail mail, fax and email form for more than 20 years, and it's been reported that up to 100 million dollars annually are swindled from folks who are taken in by it. The letter itself comes in numerous variations , under various supposed Nigerian officials' names and sometimes even purporting to have been sent from the Congo or other countries near Nigeria. Often the letter is all in caps, and generally will include awful grammar and misspelled words.
  If a person engages in communication with these folks and seems willing to conduct the transactions of which they speak (and some people they have actually flown to Nigeria and ultimately held hostage and otherwise harmed) at the last moment will begin the innocent-sounding requests for payment of an unforeseen fee, usually a couple thousand dollars but sometimes quite a bit more. Once that is paid and the victim is now 'invested' in the matter, the requests or, by this point, demands for further payments continue, to ruinous effect. It's very serious 'business.'
  So be careful, everybody. And don't trust unverifiable information in your inboxes!

"The Package of Cookies","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fooddrink/a/package_cookies.htm","2016-01-21 13:46:52","  By David Emery
  Also known as: 'The Bag of Cookies,' 'The Packet of Biscuits,' 'The Cookie Thief' and 'The Unwitting Theft '
  As told by reader Jon Light...
  This isn't a life or death story and I've only heard it once, but it has all the earmarks of an urban legend. It was told to me by a friend of mine who swore it happened to his brother. I think it's kind of cute.
  A man was returning home from a business trip and had an hour to kill in the Salt Lake City airport. At that time there was a Mrs. Fields (type) shop there that sold cookies, so he got four of his favorite kind. The clerk placed them in a bag and the man put them on a bench, took off his overcoat and sat down to read his paper.
  In a couple of minutes he noticed out of the corner of his eye that an old bag woman who had come inside to get warm sat down on the bench with him. He kept reading his paper, but kept a glancing eye on her because she seemed a little strange.
  Before too long, to his amazement he noticed her reach over, take a cookie out of the bag and begin to eat it. Wanting to send her a message but not wanting to make a fuss, he quickly pulled out a cookie himself and ate it so that there wouldn't be any doubt that the cookies belonged to him.

  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  The lady looked at him very strangely, but eventually she pulled out yet another cookie and began eating it.
  This was too much for the man, so he glared at her angrily, snatched up the last cookie himself, forcefully wadded up the bag and threw it in the near by trash can. This had the desired effect, and the old woman hurriedly gathered up her things and quickly left.
  Soon afterward it was time for him to go to his gate, so he folded his paper, stood up, picked up his overcoat... and found his still untouched bag of cookies on the bench under his coat.
  Analysis: When American folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand first wrote about this urban legend in his 1984 book The Choking Doberman , he described it as an 'English story' dating from around 1972, and one he had not yet encountered in the United States. As the above version set in Salt Lake City shows, by 1999 it had become an American story, too.
  Since the 1980s, it has made its way around Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In a variant reported by Arthur Goldstuck in The Rabbit in the Thorn Tree (London: Penguin Books, 1990), a South African woman traveling in the U.S. mistakenly believes her biscuits are being 'purloined' by a black man sitting next to her in a restaurant.
  Wherever and whenever it may be told, 'The Package of Cookies' (or 'The Packet of Biscuits,' as it's known in England) is a cautionary tale about prejudice and jumping to unwarranted conclusions. The supposed thief is usually a member of some minority group, be it a person of color, a homeless person, or an immigrant, and the supposed victim most often retaliates in a way that proves personally embarrassing when he or she later discovers there had been no thievery after all.
  The tale was famously included in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (New York: Harmony Books, 1984), a novel by Douglas Adams , who was also known to relate it in interviews as if it was something that had happened to him in real life. According to a flurry of news reports in June 2008, a version of the story also turned up in an unfinished manuscript by novelist Ian McEwan , who expressed surprise when audience members recognized it during a public reading.

  Subject: New Rape Case Tactic
  Hi everyone, I am not sure when did this happen, but it is best to be careful and safety comes first.
  She was just discharged from the hospital...
  Today after office hours, I heard from my sister-in-law that there is a new way to rape women It happened to one of our good friends The girl left the office after working hours and saw a little child crying on the road Feeling pity for the child, she went and ask what happened The child said, 'I am lost. Can you take me home please?' Then the child gave her a slip and tell the girl where the address is. And the girl, being an average kind person, didn't suspect anything and took the child there.
  And there when it arrived the 'child's home', she pressed the door bell, yet she was shocked as it the bell was wired with high voltage, and fainted. The next day when she woke up, she found herself in an empty house up in the hills, naked.
  She has never even get to see the face of the attacker... That's why nowadays crimes are targeted on kind people
  Next time if the same situation occurs, never bring the child to the intended place. If the child insist, then bring the child to the police station. Lost child are best to send to police stations.
  Please send this to all your female friends. (my extra note: guys, please tell your mom, your sister, your wife and your girlfriends too!)
  Analysis: Despite the fact that recent variants of this rumor have been shared under the guise of 'police warnings' or 'sheriff's department warnings,' I've found no reports of documented cases in which rapists actually used (or even attempted to use) crying children as bait to lure female victims.
  To the contrary, law enforcement officials have repeatedly denounced these warnings as hoaxes .
  The earliest version I'm aware of was forwarded to me in 2005 by a reporter in Singapore who had already identified it as an urban legend . Within a month it had made its way to South Africa, and by May 2005 I was receiving copies of it from readers in the United States. As of 2013, eight years later the first sighting, law enforcement agencies were still fielding inquiries about it from El Paso to Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.
  People sometimes defend viral warnings like these by arguing that, even if false in their particulars, they remind women to keep their wits about them and be careful, and that can't hurt. What weakens that argument is that the false warnings are, in fact, so specific. To the degree that potential victims are persuaded to focus their attention on, say, a crying child as a sign that an attacker may be nearby, the more likely it is that they'll be inattentive to other cues — real cues — that they're in danger.

"The Roommate's Death","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/roommate.htm","2016-05-31 04:04:08","  By David Emery
  As told by Felicia McEntire...
  This story has been told over and over in my town (Harrison, Arkansas). Here goes...
  There were two college roommates, Sarah and Megan. Sarah was the theatrical type and loved acting. She was in all the town's plays. Megan was more of a book person, she loved to read and her studies were her first priority.
  Anyway, there was a huge play called 'Oh, Susannah' that Sarah was in, and it was coming up on Saturday ... so every chance that Sarah got, she would practice in the park (that's where she got her inspiration) for hours. Every time, she would beg Megan to go with her, but Megan would stay in the dorm and read.
  Well, on Saturday Sarah was a hit. Being the star, she was detained after the play, and got home really late. As she entered, she heard her roommate's rocking chair squeaking in the corner, but couldn't see it, not all the lights were on. Must be waiting for me, Sarah thought. Putting her stuff away, she went back into the main room.

  From the corner came a voice. It sounded rather husky, but that wasn't what agitated Sarah.
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...' came the voice.
  'Stop it Megan! Don't give me that crap, okay?' said Sarah.
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop it! I mean it, Meg!'
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop!!!!! That's it!!!!' Sarah screamed as she flicked on the room's lights.
  Sarah gawked in horror at the sight. Her roommate's body was in the rocking chair , but her head wasn't, her head was on the wall, kept there by a butcher knife. From behind the rocking chair she could hear laughter – maniacal laughter.
  'Who's there? Who are you?'
  From behind the rocking chair jumped a man, later found out to be the butcher that escaped from the sanitarium in the next town. All the time he was cutting Sarah, he was singing, over and over, 'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me... I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee.'
  Pinning Sarah to the wall next to her roommate's head, he screamed, 'Now, Susannah, don't you cry for me!!!!'
  Analysis: Before the term ' urban legend ' became popular, folklorists referred to tales of this kind as 'migratory legends' because they pop up from place to place over time, studded with localized details to enhance their credibility and emotional impact. The legend retold above is a hometown variant of 'The Roommate's Death,' which dates back to the 1960s and shares motifs with ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? ' and ' Humans Can Lick, Too .'
  One thing that distinguishes this version of the story from others is 'Oh, Susannah,' the killer's chant. The repetition of this line from the chorus of the old folk song not only ratchets up the horror of the moment when the murderer's presence is revealed, but suggests — because he is clearly aware that she has been rehearsing a play called 'Oh, Susannah' — that he has been stalking and observing her for quite some time.
  Another way this version differs from other retellings is how it ends: Instead of escaping with her life (traditionally, the story is given a 'close call' ending), the protagonist is left helpless in the clutches of the crazed killer who murdered her roommate.

"Safety Warning: Propane Tanks Used in Meth Labs","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/propane_tanks.htm","2016-01-17 03:13:13","  By David Emery
  Viral alert warns purchasers of propane tanks to avoid buying tanks with blue or green residue around the valve, an indication they may be contaminated with anhydrous ammonia. Authorities confirm that propane tanks can be contaminated in this manner, but say it's relatively unlikely they would end up in consumers' hands.
  Description: Viral safety warning Circulating since: April 2008 Status: True, but overblown
  Example #1: Email contributed by Ruthann B., April 27, 2008:
  This is scary...
  Subject: Meth Training Information Importance: High
  Hey guys. I was at a meth training/workshop yesterday and there was a lot of great new information presented. I wanted to let you all know about one thing that I was not aware of.
  Meth cooks are getting the propane tanks from the exchanges at Wal-Mart, Kroger, etc. and emptying them of the propane. Then, they are filling them with anhydrous ammonia (which they now have a recipe for by the way). After they are finished with them, they return them to the store. They are then refilled with propane and sent back for you and me to buy. Anhydrous ammonia is very corrosive and weakens the structure of the tank. It can be very dangerous when mixed with propane and hooked up to our grills, etc.
  According to our presenter, you should inspect the propane tank for any blue or greenish residue around the valve areas. If it is present, refuse to purchase that one.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Example #2: Email contributed by J. Reim, May 18, 2008:
  Fwd: propane tanks
  Hello and how is your day so far? Where I am sitting, it is another D&D Day. You know DAMP and DREARY DAY. I just received this e-mail from a very good friend who is still involved with Law Enforcement. Since the grillin' season is upon us, I figured another PUBLIC SERVICE announcement was in order. It has to do with propane tanks which we all use. While I haven't heard of METH labs in my area lately, one never knows. As always, to be forewarned is always a safe encounter.
  Be careful when you exchange your PROPANE TANKS
  Meth cooks are getting exchange propane tanks from places like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Home Depot, Lowes and various services stations in your area. They empty them of the propane and then they are filling them with anhydrous ammonia (which they now have a recipe for by the way). After they are finished with them, they return them to the store. They are then refilled with propane and sent back for you and me to buy.
  Anhydrous ammonia is very corrosive and weakens the structure of the propane tank. It can be very dangerous when mixed with propane and hooked up to our grills, etc.
  You should inspect the propane tank for any blue or greenish residue around the valve areas. If it is present, refuse to purchase that one.
  You should check out the following website for more details. They also have pictures you can show.
  http://www.npga.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=529
  Analysis: This falls under the category of information you're probably better off having, even though it's unlikely you'll ever need to use it.
  Drug makers do sometimes use discarded or stolen propane tanks as vessels for anhydrous ammonia , a key and very dangerous ingredient in the manufacture of homebrew methamphetamine (aka crystal meth, crank, ice or meth). As a result, the tanks end up both corroded and contaminated by the chemical, making them extremely hazardous to re-use. The only tell-tale sign is a blue-green stain around the brass valve.
  According to propane tank suppliers these damaged tanks rarely get recycled or resold, however — if for no other reason than the folks responsible for the damage don't want to attract attention to their illegal activities.
  In June 2008, not long after media alerts about the dangers of re-purposed propane tanks began circulating, Philip Squair of the National Propane Gas Association told the Cleveland Plain Dealer he was unaware of a single instance of injuries resulting from the re-use of a propane tank damaged by use in a meth lab. (The original NPGA warning that served as the basis for the media alerts was issued in 2002 and has since been removed from the organization's website.)
  “Of the millions of tanks processed in a year, we encounter only a very, very few tanks that may have been used in meth production,” says Tod Brown, president of Blue Rhino , the leading U.S. provider of propane tank exchange. “Blue Rhino immediately contacts hazardous materials response units to properly dispose of any tanks suspected to have been used in the production or transport of methamphetamine. We work to ensure these tanks don’t make it back to the store or a griller’s backyard.”
  As recently as April 2015, government authorities re-affirmed that it's possible for propane tanks contaminated by use in meth labs to wind up in the hands of consumers, but rare. 'There is no indication of a widespread epidemic of propane tanks being tampered with or used to hold products other than propane,' Massachusetts state fire marshal Stephen Coan said in an April 12, 2015 statement to WCVB-TV in Boston.
  Consumers may still wish to take the better-safe-than-sorry approach and check for damage or contamination before purchasing recycled propane tanks, particularly from smaller, potentially less-than-scrupulous dealers.

  Comments: False. Michigan State Police officials have labeled this message a hoax, stating there is 'no such effort underway at this time, or any time in the future, to generate revenue through the issuance of traffic citations.' Bogus ' speeding ticket frenzy ' warnings are an online staple, first erupting in New Jersey in 2005 and cropping up regularly ever since. Prior to the appearance of this version, the last such warning targeting Michigan drivers made the rounds in January 2008. Although Michigan has no such program, the name 'Operation Yellow Jacket' has been applied by other states to public safety projects involving the collaboration of State Police and Departments of Transportation. In Pennsylvania, state troopers actually do masquerade as transportation workers to catch speeding drivers in construction zones. A similar program in North Carolina involves Highway Patrol cruisers hiding behind DOT trucks with radar guns at the ready.

  Analysis: This is a hoax whose only reason for existence is to frighten young women.  'Progesterex' doesn't exist. There's no mention of it anywhere in medical or scientific literature.
  All versions of the forwarded warning, in circulation since November 1999, display features common to urban legends and Internet hoaxes :
  Rohypnol , the surgical anesthetic also mentioned in the email, does exist and has frequently been implicated in cases of date rape. It is said to dissolve quickly in liquids, and, when combined with alcohol, causes drowsiness, lowered inhibition, and memory loss. (The drug was recently reformulated to change color when dissolved in liquid so its presence is more detectable.)
  It's important for young women to be aware of the crime of date rape and the fact that drugs are used to sedate date rape victims. But it's equally important to separate fact from fiction. The 'Progesterex' scare is baseless. If you receive this hoax by email, please don't forward it on.

"The End of Social Security Paper Checks","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/federalbenefitprograms/a/No-More-Paper-Social-Security-Checks.htm","2016-06-04 11:08:55","  By Tom Murse
  The U.S. Department of Treasury began phasing out paper Social Security checks and other federal benefit checks on May 1, 2011. It required anyone applying for Social Security checks and other federal benefits on and after that date to receive their payments electronically.
  [ Applying for Social Security Benefits ]
  Those who began receiving Social Security checks before May of 2011 have until March 1, 2013, to sign up for electronic payments, the Treasury Department announced. Those who don't sign up to have their Social Security checks direct-deposited by that date would receive their benefits through the Direct Express card program .
  'Getting your Social Security or Supplemental Security Income payment by direct deposit or Direct Express is safer and more reliable,' Michael J. Astrue, the commissioner of Social Security, said in announcing the change.
  The change applied to Social Security, Supplemental Security Income , Veterans Affairs benefits , and anyone who receives benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board , Office of Personnel Management and Department of Labor (Black Lung) .
  'You don't have to worry about your check being lost or stolen and your money is available immediately on your payment date,' Astrue said. 'There is no need to wait for the mail to arrive.'
  In 2010, more than 540,000 Social Security and Supplemental Security Income paper checks were reported lost or stolen and had to be replaced, the Treasury Department said.
  Phasing out paper Social Security checks entirely is expected to save taxpayers about $120 million every year, or more than $1 billion over 10 years. Government officials also pointed out that eliminating paper Social Security checks will 'provide positive benefits to the environment, saving 12 million pounds of paper in the first five years alone.'
  'More than 18 million baby boomers are expected to reach retirement age during the next five years, with 10,000 people a day becoming eligible for Social Security benefits,' said Treasurer Rosie Rios.
  'It costs 92 cents more to issue a payment by paper check than by direct deposit. We are retiring the Social Security paper check option in favor of electronic payments because it is the right thing to do for benefit recipients and American taxpayers alike.'
  If you are applying for new benefits , you are now required to choose an electronic payment method, whether it's direct deposit of your Social Security check or other federal benefit into a bank or credit union account .
  When you apply for your Social Security check or other federal benefit, you will need:
  You can also choose to receive your Social Security check on a prepaid debit card or Direct Express Debit MasterCard card.
  If you currently get your Social Security check or other federal benefit payment on paper, you must switch to electronic payments before March 1, 2013.
  You can switch from paper checks to direct deposit at www.GoDirect.org , by calling the U.S. Treasury Electronic Payment Solution Center's toll-free helpline at (800) 333-1795, or by speaking with a bank or credit union representative.
  Anyone already receiving federal benefit payments electronically will continue to receive their money as usual on their payment day. No action is required.
  The first monthly Social Security check was received by Ida Mae Fuller on Jan. 31, 1940, according to the Treasury Department. Since then about 165 million people have received Social Security benefits.
  The movement toward electronic payments has been steadily increasing, the Treasury Department said. By May of 2011, electronic payments made up more than three-quarters of all noncash payments nationwide.
  There were 5.7 billion fewer checks written in 2009 than in 2006, a decline of 6.1 percent per year - while electronic payments grew 9.3 percent during that same period. Among federal benefit recipients, about eight in 10 receive their Social Security check or other federal benefit payment electronically, according to the Treasury Department .

"The Reverse PIN Hoax - Urban Legends","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/fl/The-Reverse-PIN-Hoax-Urban-Legends.htm","2016-08-14 04:13:07","  By David Emery
  An online rumor started in October 2006 claims ATM users can quickly contact police in the event of an attempted robbery by entering their PIN in reverse. This claim is false.
  False, for now, that is. Technology exists which would allow ATM users to contact police in an emergency by punching in their PIN (personal identification number) in reverse, but as of this publication it has not yet been implemented anywhere in the United States.
  Lawmakers in the states of Kansas and Illinois introduced legislation calling for the institution of reverse-PIN emergency notification systems (also known under the brand name SafetyPIN) in 2004, but the Kansas bill stalled in committee and the Illinois bill was watered down at the behest of the banking industry, making the adoption of the technology purely voluntary — which it already was.
  According to a story published in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , bankers are opposed to the reverse-PIN system because of safety concerns.
  They fear that ATM users might hesitate or fumble under duress while trying to enter their PINs backwards, possibly increasing the chances of violence. The banking industry is in favor of finding a means to protect ATM customers, a member of the American Bankers Association said, but question whether the reverse-PIN solution is the right one.
  The inventor of SafetyPIN, Joseph Zingher, claims the banking industry is afraid to admit the growing extent of ATM robbery. Exact figures are hard to come by because ATM holdups are lumped in with other types of bank robbery in the FBI's annual crime statistics. Of the 8,000 to 12,000 bank robberies per year counted by the FBI over the past 15 years, 3,000 to 4,000 were ATM robberies, according to the banking industry. Some crime experts suspect the figure is actually higher.
  Bankers, for their part, insist they do acknowledge the problem of ATM crime and recommend that customers exercise due caution and be aware of their surroundings when using automated teller machines.
  Here's a sample email about the false claim of a reverse pin number contributed by J. Brouse on Dec. 6, 2006.
  PIN NUMBER REVERSAL (GOOD TO KNOW) If you should ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your Pin # in reverse. For example if your pin number is 1234 then you would put in 4321. The ATM recognizes that your pin number is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine. The machine will still give you the money you requested, but unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to help you. This information was recently broadcast on TV stating that it is seldom used because people don't know it exists.

One drives a red/maroon sedan and has dark hair. The other is blonde and drives a tan station wagon with a dark stripe down the side. They mostly walk the neighborhoods and ask people if they know which houses have children! They're super cute and friendly and try to get kids to come up to their fences. They seem especially interested in young girls. BE CAREFUL, WATCHFUL and DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR if one knocks on you door! Better safe than sorry!!!

  Email from Nov. 18, 2008
  Subject: Warning from Police ---- No Joke!!! Warning..!!!! Warning..!!!! Warning..!!!! Just last weekend on Friday night we parked in a public parking area. As we drove away I noticed a sticker on the rear window of the car. When I took it off after I got home, it was a receipt for gas. Luckily my friend told me not to stop as it could be someone waiting for me to get out of the car. Then we received this email yesterday: WARNING FROM POLICE THIS APPLIES TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN BEWARE OF PAPER ON THE BACK WINDOW OF YOUR VEHICLE-- NEW WAY TO DO CARJACKINGS (NOT A JOKE)' Heads up everyone! Please, keep this circulating... You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside. You start the engine and shift into Reverse. When you look into the rearview mirror to back out of your parking space, you notice a piece of paper stuck to the middle of the rear window. So, you shift into Park, unlock your doors, and jump out of your car to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view. When you reach the back of your car, that is when the carjackers appear out of nowhere, jump into your car and take off. They practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. And guess what, ladies? I bet your purse is still in the car. So now the carjacker has your car, your home address, your money, and your keys. Your home and your whole identity are now compromised! BEWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME THAT IS NOW BEING USED. If you see a piece of paper stuck to your back window, just drive away. Remove the paper later. And be thankful that you read this e-mail. I hope you will forward this to friends and family, especially to women. A purse contains all kinds of personal information and identification documents, and you certainly do NOT want this to fall into the wrong hands. Please keep this going and tell all your friends.
  Email from Feb. 23, 2004:
  It's plausible, could happen, and for all we know has happened. But despite the fact that this viral warning has been in non-stop circulation since February 2004, there is no published report confirming that an incident of this kind actually took place. Police do warn drivers to be wary of strangers approaching with flyers, asking for directions, faking a fender-bender, or using other pretexts to gain access to a vehicle and its driver, but judging from the available data a typical carjacker is more likely to flash a weapon and try to remove you from your car by force than to try to trick you into exiting of your own accord. While it's prudent to take stock of this warning and keep it in mind as one method a carjacker might use to separate drivers from their vehicles, it's equally prudent to note that, like most viral warnings of its kind, its claims are unsubstantiated. Whatever strategy a carjacker may employ, it's sure to include trying to take the victim by surprise. Much more important than worrying about whether or not to remove a piece of paper stuck to your rear window, therefore — in any situation where you may be vulnerable to theft or assault — is staying aware of your surroundings and taking note of who may be lurking in the vicinity as you enter or exit your automobile.
  A version of this alert is circulating in the form of a scanned hard copy . In November 2014, Maryland Assistant Attorney General Karen Straughn made national headlines by issuing an official warning very similar to the viral messages quoted above. She admitted, however, that she had not seen any actual police reports confirming that such incidents have taken place.

There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks. It smells like strawberry also and it is being handed out to kids in school yards in AR. I'm sure it will make its way around the country if it hasn't already. Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the E.R. in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange - it looks just like pop rocks. Please instruct your children to not accept candy that looks like this even from a friend and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. Please pass this around it could save some family a lot of heartache!

  Example #2: Email contributed by Madelynn, April 30, 2007:
  Subject: Strawberry Meth I have been alerted by one of our EMT's for our volunteer fire department that they have received emails from emergency responder organizations to be on the lookout for a new form of Crystalized Meth that is targeted at children and to be aware of this new form if called to an emergency involving a child that may have symptoms of drug induction or overdose. They are calling this new form of meth 'Strawberry Quick' and it looks like the 'Pop Rocks' candy that sizzle in your mouth. In it's current form, it is dark pink in color and has a strawberry scent to it. Please advise your children and their friends and other students not to accept candy from strangers as this is obviously an attempt to seduce children into drug use. They also need to be cautious in accepting candy from even friends that may have received it from someone else, thinking it is just candy. I don't want this email to scare anyone, but as a parent, coach, volunteer firefighter and friend, I thought it would be best to share this with you, so you can once again talk to your children about the effects of drugs and how easy it could be to take drugs without knowing it, until it is too late. I worry, just as each of you do about kids and drugs and all the problems our kids today are faced with. So please talk with your children about this newest threat to get children addicted to drugs! http://www.ky3.com/news/6626012.html Click above for a news article about this from just across the state line in Missouri.What typically is not in this part of the country is now not too far from us here in Northwest Arkansas. Take care, God Bless and I've said a prayer that none of our kids will ever be faced with taking or being addicted to drugs!
  Analysis: Drug enforcement officials confirm that pink-tinted varieties of crystal meth do exist, but reports of strawberry-flavored methamphetamine ('Strawberry Quick') remain unsubstantiated.
  In March 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced it had received reports of drug traffickers offering candy-flavored methamphetamine for sale in western and midwestern states from California to Minnesota in the form of colorful crystals resembling Pop Rocks.
  The first such report had been issued three months earlier by the Nevada Department of Public Safety after samples of what narcotics agents believed to be strawberry-flavored meth — nicknamed 'Strawberry Quick' — were confiscated in a drug raid. State officials speculated that illegal drug manufacturers were experimentally reformulating crystal meth by adding strawberry and other sweet flavorings to make the bitter-tasting, highly addictive stimulant more attractive to potential teenage customers.
  After several months of following up on these reports, however, DEA officials told reporters they 'hadn't seen much' in the way of actual seizures of flavored methamphetamine and that the DEA itself had yet to seize or analyze any of the stuff at all.
  As of June 2007, experts were speculating that local drug enforcement agencies may have confused samples of colored meth — which is quite common and accounted for by dyes present in the raw ingredients — for what they took to be a new, flavored variety of the drug. Jeanne Cox, executive director of the Meth Project Foundation, summarized the quandary in a statement to the drug policy website JoinTogether.org: 'We are all still trying to figure out what's going on with strawberry meth and if it really exists.' Meanwhile, the waters were further muddied by reports that drug dealers in California had begun marketing new, strawberry- and coconut-flavored varieties of cocaine. In July 2008 the DEA confirmed receiving samples of pink- and off-white-tinted cocaine (not methamphetamine) with a 'generic, sweet, fruity odor.' 'Although flavored 'hard' drugs (notably 'strawberry meth') have received extensive press in the mass media,' the July 2008 report went on to say, 'to date very few such exhibits have been submitted to the DEA Laboratories.'
  10/31/08 - According to DEA public affairs officer Barbara Wetherell, the agency has found no evidence to substantiate that Strawberry Quick or any other form of flavored methamphetamine exists. 'This is an urban myth,' she told ColumbusLocalNews.com in a story published Oct. 31, 2008. 'We surveyed all of our offices yesterday (Oct. 30) and we found nothing. This is just one of those emails.'
  • A new version of the alert tagged 'Halloween Warning' began circulating in Oct. 2007.
  • A new version on a Memorial Physician Services letterhead began circulating in Dec. 2012.

"Sugar Water in the Gas Tank","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/sugar_gas_tank.htm","2016-04-29 04:34:20","  Internet urban legend warns of a criminal ploy to disable women's vehicles by pouring sugar water in their gas tanks . Does this trick really work?
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: Oct. 2005 (this version) Status: Dubious (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Lisa L., Oct. 14, 2005:
  Analysis: While it's not 100 percent beyond the realm of possibility, the incident described above seems unlikely to have happened given the haphazard nature of the ploy involved.
  Putting sugar or water in the gas tank of a vehicle can indeed cause the engine to stall: sugar, because the granules won't dissolve in gasoline and may clog the fuel filter; water, because it interrupts combustion -- but neither method will produce a predictably-timed engine failure.
  Depending on the quantity of the foreign substance introduced, it might take minutes, hours, or even days for the stall to occur, if it occurs at all.
  The same would hold true if the foreign substance was a sugar-water mixture. Dissolved in water, the sugar's effect would be negligible, so it's essentially no different than pouring plain H2O in the gas tank.
  The point is, the evildoer who plans to use this method to waylay his victim in a conveniently secluded spot is leaving an awful lot to chance, and, more likely than not, will fail. Which makes it unlikely that such a ploy is often used.
  It may seem strange, then, to find email reports of incidents matching this exact description happening in Target store parking lots everywhere from Kansas to Texas to North Carolina .
  But it's not so strange when you consider that this forwarded message has been circulating non-stop since 2005, accruing 'helpful' bits of misinformation along the way. In this respect the text fulfills the classic definition of what folklorists call a 'migratory legend,' with individuals revising specific details to localize the tale before passing it along.
  At the same time, the story has inspired skeptical news coverage in some cities based on disavowals by local police. “It’s not happening in Hickory,' police captain Clyde Deal told the Hickory, NC Daily Record after the email surfaced there in March 2007. “As far as we can tell, it’s not happening anywhere in western North Carolina.” Assistant police chief Mike Samp of Mishawaka, Indiana, gave a similar response to the South Bend Tribune : 'We researched it and could find no police report, which quite naturally, made us suspicious.' Police in Wheeling, Ohio simply dismissed it as a hoax.
  Sifting through my email archives, I discovered a variant of this story dating from November 2002 in which a perpetrator who disables a woman's car with sugar water is captured by police and found to have an array of kidnapping implements hidden in his van.
  This alternate version bears a general similarity to the one we've already seen, but is also reminiscent of ' The Knife in the Briefcase ,' an urban legend circulating online since the late '90s in which a woman survives a close call in a shopping mall parking lot with a 'good Samaritan' who turns out to be packing a knife, duct tape, and chloroform.
  Email contributed by G. Borland, Nov. 11, 2002:
  Cautionary tales are meant to instruct, and in a vague sense these examples may be edifying even though they're false, in that they remind potential crime victims to take note of their surroundings and be wary of the advances of strangers when alone. But they also mislead, diverting attention to fictional scenarios and creating a climate of fear.
  Remember the fable of the boy who cried wolf? People will only be deceived so many times before they just stop listening, and that defeats the purpose.

"A Tail of Two Toothbrushes","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/toothbrush_tail.htm","2016-05-07 15:44:47","  By David Emery
  As told by Susan Waldron:
  A couple from suburban California were vacationing in Jamaica when their room was broken into and everything stolen, with the exception of their camera and their toothbrushes. Considering themselves fortunate to have retained the camera with their vacation photos, they returned home where they had the film developed.
  Two pictures were unidentifiable — something like an aerial view of two mounds of dark earth with a pole in between. They later realized, to their horror, that it was a photo of their toothbrushes up someone's rear end.
  As told by Helen Vanscoy:
  I heard this one while waitressing in Miami ten years ago. I think part of what made it seem plausible was the fact that the folks in South Florida are so often warned about crime targeting tourists, plus they often vacation in the Caribbean.
  Of course, this happened to a friend of a friend of mine!
  The 'friend' and his new wife went to Jamaica for their honeymoon, where they stayed in a bungalow on the beach. One day they came back to their bungalow to discover they'd been robbed. The burglars had taken everything of value, their money, binoculars, video camera, even clothes, but luckily had missed their camera and some worthless personal items, such as toiletries.
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  The couple decided to make the best of it, and enjoyed the rest of their honeymoon. Once back in Miami, they had the film developed from their vacation. There, along with the pictures of themselves snorkeling and hanging out on the beach, were some pictures the burglars had taken.
  The robbers had taken turns shoving the couple's toothbrushes up their rectums and photographing each other doing so.
  Analysis: You will also find this charming urban legend and its many variants discussed in Jan Harold Brunvand's The Baby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends (W.W. Norton: 1993). The chapter is aptly titled, ' Indecent Exposures .'
  As Brunvand, an academic folklorist, notes in the book, the anecdote has been set in many different locales since it first began circulating in the early 1990s, most often in tropical climes such as Jamaica, but not always. Sometimes the unfortunate vacationers are said to be on a camping trip; frequently they're said to be honeymooners; in most cases they are said reside in the hometown of whoever happens to be telling the 'true story.'
  'In no case,' writes Brunvand, 'is the narrator any closer than a FOAF — 'friend of a friend' — of these victims, nor has anyone I know ever actually seen the revealing photos.'
  Most versions have racial overtones, in that the victims tend to be white and the criminals black, but the deeper impact of the story lies in the grossness of the photographed act and the shock of its discovery. In one of the earliest tellings I'm familiar with, the anally fixated burglars were described as members of a 'white trash' motorcycle gang. Brunvand cites a version in which the offense is committed by an individual burglar, 'an old, toothless, bearded man.'
  I'm inclined to think of the toothbrush-in-the-rectum story as one of those adult fairy tales of suburbia in which horrid things happen to ordinary, middle-class folks who wander from the safety of their homes and neighborhoods, encountering people 'who are not like us.' It expresses a generalized distrust of strangers and strange places — also known as xenophobia — ultimately an emotional reverberation of childhood insecurities, I suspect. It's also one of the most cringe-worthy cautionary tales you're ever likely to hear.
  Is there any reason to think the story is true, in whole or in part? Has an incident like this ever really happened?
  Let's face it, it's been told a gazillion times by a gazillion different people, each and every one claiming that it 'really, truly happened to a friend of a friend.'
  What are the odds?

"Rumor: Car Thieves Clone Remote Keyless Entry Codes to Unlock Vehicle Doors","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/automobiles/a/car_locks.htm","2016-01-15 22:26:25","  By David Emery
  Forwarded email urges vehicle owners to lock doors manually instead of using a remote key, otherwise thieves might be able to clone the security code (a technique known as 'code grabbing') and gain entry to the vehicle.
  Description: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: June 2008 Status: Partly true / Overblown (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by J. Meyer, July 24, 2008:
  Beware folks. This is news you can use.
  THIS HAS BEEN CHECKED ON SNOPES
  A friend's son came over yesterday - he had to go to Canada for work last week. One of the other engineer's traveling to Canada with him, but in his own car had something happen... that I need to share.
  While traveling he stopped at the roadside park, similar to what we have here with bathrooms, vending machines etc. He came out to his car less than 4-5 minutes later and found someone had gotten into his car, and stolen his cell phone, laptop computer, gps navigator, briefcase..... you name it.
  They called the police and since there were no signs of his car being broke into - the police told him that there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your key-chain locking device. They set a distance away and watch for their next victim. Since they know you are going inside of the store, restaurant, or bathroom and have a few minutes to steal and run.
  The police office said... to be sure to manually lock your car door-by hitting the lock button inside the car, that way if there is someone setting in a parking lot watching for their next victim it will not be you.
  When you hit the lock button on your car upon exiting... it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the door lock on your key chain- it sends the code thru the airwaves where it can be stolen.
  I just wanted to let you know about this... it is something totally new to us...and this is real... it just happened this past Thursday June 19th to his co-worker...
  so be aware of this and please pass this note on... look how many times we all lock our doors with our keys... just to be sure we remembered to lock them.... and bingo the guys have our code... and whatever was in the car... can be gone.
  This came from a friend......
  This is very troubling what lengths people will go to to steal what doesn't belong to them! I do almost 100% of the time lock my car on the door lock inside when I exit the car. Little did I know that is the best way to lock your car.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: First, a word to the wise. Just because an email claims the information it contains has been verified on Snopes.com (or elsewhere), that isn't necessarily the case. This message, for example, contains a mixture of true and false information (which is what Snopes.com actually says).
  Given the current state of remote keyless entry (RKE) technology, some version of the scenario described above are theoretically possible, but it isn't a threat the average vehicle owner needs to worry about. Virtually all RKE systems use a form of data encryption adopted in the late 1990s known as KEELOQ, which, though it has been shown in experiments to be potentially vulnerable to hackers, still (as of this writing) presents a formidable enough technological hurdle that most car thieves wouldn't even be able to attempt cracking it.
  'Code grabbing' all but obsolete since the late '90s
  As written, the warning reads more like a blast from the past, when RKE technology was still in its infancy, than a cutting-edge informational alert. Compare it to this excerpt from a New York Times article dated July 14, 1996:
  Experts on vehicle theft say sophisticated car thieves have taken to hiding in parking lots where there is a lot of traffic, like those at airports, with high-tech recording devices. As you lock your car with the keyless remote control, the thieves record the signal that it transmits. After you leave, they play back the recording, unlock your car and steal it.
  A similar warning was issued in a CBS News report aired in 1998:
  'So typically, what happens is a person will arm their alarm, which in fact does lock their doors, [and] walk into a mall knowing for a couple of hours that their car is protected,' Meenan explains.
  Not exactly. Now their car is defenseless to a 'Code Grabber.' And it's so easy to use. Armed with the electronic 'code grabber,' we could steal motorists' car keys right out of thin air.
  That, however, was 10 years ago. Soon after these stories were published, the adoption of KEELOQ encryption made 'code grabbing' much more difficult to accomplish.
  While it's true that a 2007 study identified vulnerabilities in KEELOQ encryption and prompted some experts to call for improvements, others downplayed its real-world significance. 'There is not a whole lot of threat to the end consumer,' PGP Corp. chief technology officer Jon Callas explained to MSNBC in August of last year. 'A guy with a Slim Jim is a bigger threat.'

  In the digital age most of us have likely found ourselves annoyed by how and when another has used their mobile phone in our presence. Likewise, most of us have probably also found ourselves feeling self-conscious about our own mobile phone use in the company of others. Remarking on these relatively new trends, sociologists would point out that both are happening because the infusion of mobile technologies into our everyday lives disrupts taken for granted social norms that govern how we interact with each other in public and in groups.
  But while old norms are being disrupted, the fluidity of culture and social life means that new norms are emerging as a result of the addition of devices like smartphones to our everyday interactions. A 2015 study by Pew Research Center found just that by surveying over 3,000 U.S. adults about their own mobile phone use and perceptions of that of others.
  Based on the survey results it seems that a societal-wide consensus has emerged as to where in public or group settings it is acceptable to use a mobile phone and when it is not.
  Those considered acceptable generally are public places like sidewalks, public transit, and waiting in line. On the other hand, most of us believe that it is rude to use a mobile phone at a restaurant, in a meeting, while eating with family, at places where quiet is expected, and at church or religious events.
  Why is this so? It turns out that most of us believe that the presence of mobile phones does harm to the quality of in-person interactions (women slightly more than men; and those above 50 years of age more than those younger). To this end, the survey revealed that about a quarter of us admit that using a mobile phone in a group setting diminishes our attention to those present around us.
  Yet the survey also revealed that our views conflict with our practices, as each of us often breaks these new rules, though we endorse them. Nearly 90 percent of those surveyed said that they had used a mobile phone during the most recent social event they had attended. The most common forms of use reported were reading a text or email and using the phone's camera (about 60 percent each); and sending a text or email, or receiving a call (more than 50 percent). Less common are the practices of checking one's device for a notification, placing a call, using an app, or browsing the web.
  Why are we using our phones in the presence of others? The study found that a minority use their devices as a way to disengage from those present or to avoid the topic of conversation. But more common is the practice of using one's mobile device--smartphones especially--in ways that are connected to the event or gathering at which one is present. The vast majority of us do this, and we report using our phones to share on social media pictures or videos from the event, an update about the event, or to access information that is relevant to the event or those present. To this end, about a third of U.S. adults believe that using a mobile device in the presence of others can contribute positively to the interaction.
  Unsurprisingly, giving differences in rates of smartphone and mobile phone use across age groups, young adults are more likely to believe that using a mobile device in the presence of others is acceptable versus those from older age groups. However the results of the study show that new social norms that cross generational divides are now observable in society.
  So what does it all mean? The results point to a couple of key divides. One, perhaps rather obvious divide, seems to exist between spaces where we expect a courteous level of quiet, and those where noise and disruption is acceptable. The other appears between what we consider intimate, personal, and sacred events or gatherings, and those considered casual or informal in nature. In part, this divide is about whether or not others present expect our attention, care, and interest, or whether they are strangers who we are expected to leave alone .

"Sugar Water in the Gas Tank","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/sugar_gas_tank.htm","2016-04-29 04:34:20","  Internet urban legend warns of a criminal ploy to disable women's vehicles by pouring sugar water in their gas tanks . Does this trick really work?
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: Oct. 2005 (this version) Status: Dubious (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Lisa L., Oct. 14, 2005:
  Analysis: While it's not 100 percent beyond the realm of possibility, the incident described above seems unlikely to have happened given the haphazard nature of the ploy involved.
  Putting sugar or water in the gas tank of a vehicle can indeed cause the engine to stall: sugar, because the granules won't dissolve in gasoline and may clog the fuel filter; water, because it interrupts combustion -- but neither method will produce a predictably-timed engine failure.
  Depending on the quantity of the foreign substance introduced, it might take minutes, hours, or even days for the stall to occur, if it occurs at all.
  The same would hold true if the foreign substance was a sugar-water mixture. Dissolved in water, the sugar's effect would be negligible, so it's essentially no different than pouring plain H2O in the gas tank.
  The point is, the evildoer who plans to use this method to waylay his victim in a conveniently secluded spot is leaving an awful lot to chance, and, more likely than not, will fail. Which makes it unlikely that such a ploy is often used.
  It may seem strange, then, to find email reports of incidents matching this exact description happening in Target store parking lots everywhere from Kansas to Texas to North Carolina .
  But it's not so strange when you consider that this forwarded message has been circulating non-stop since 2005, accruing 'helpful' bits of misinformation along the way. In this respect the text fulfills the classic definition of what folklorists call a 'migratory legend,' with individuals revising specific details to localize the tale before passing it along.
  At the same time, the story has inspired skeptical news coverage in some cities based on disavowals by local police. “It’s not happening in Hickory,' police captain Clyde Deal told the Hickory, NC Daily Record after the email surfaced there in March 2007. “As far as we can tell, it’s not happening anywhere in western North Carolina.” Assistant police chief Mike Samp of Mishawaka, Indiana, gave a similar response to the South Bend Tribune : 'We researched it and could find no police report, which quite naturally, made us suspicious.' Police in Wheeling, Ohio simply dismissed it as a hoax.
  Sifting through my email archives, I discovered a variant of this story dating from November 2002 in which a perpetrator who disables a woman's car with sugar water is captured by police and found to have an array of kidnapping implements hidden in his van.
  This alternate version bears a general similarity to the one we've already seen, but is also reminiscent of ' The Knife in the Briefcase ,' an urban legend circulating online since the late '90s in which a woman survives a close call in a shopping mall parking lot with a 'good Samaritan' who turns out to be packing a knife, duct tape, and chloroform.
  Email contributed by G. Borland, Nov. 11, 2002:
  Cautionary tales are meant to instruct, and in a vague sense these examples may be edifying even though they're false, in that they remind potential crime victims to take note of their surroundings and be wary of the advances of strangers when alone. But they also mislead, diverting attention to fictional scenarios and creating a climate of fear.
  Remember the fable of the boy who cried wolf? People will only be deceived so many times before they just stop listening, and that defeats the purpose.

  Fw: CHILDRENS CRYSTAL METH - FYI Really scary. This is so sad!!! Children's Meth There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that all need to be aware of. There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks. It smells like strawberry also and it is being handed out to kids in school yards in AR. I'm sure it will make its way around the country if it hasn't already. Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the E.R. in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange - it looks just like pop rocks. Please instruct your children to not accept candy that looks like this even from a friend and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. Please pass this around it could save some family a lot of heartache! That is what they are calling strawberry meth or strawberry quick. Thought you'd want to know.

  Public Safety Myths
  Example #2: Email contributed by Madelynn, April 30, 2007:
  Subject: Strawberry Meth I have been alerted by one of our EMT's for our volunteer fire department that they have received emails from emergency responder organizations to be on the lookout for a new form of Crystalized Meth that is targeted at children and to be aware of this new form if called to an emergency involving a child that may have symptoms of drug induction or overdose. They are calling this new form of meth 'Strawberry Quick' and it looks like the 'Pop Rocks' candy that sizzle in your mouth. In it's current form, it is dark pink in color and has a strawberry scent to it. Please advise your children and their friends and other students not to accept candy from strangers as this is obviously an attempt to seduce children into drug use. They also need to be cautious in accepting candy from even friends that may have received it from someone else, thinking it is just candy. I don't want this email to scare anyone, but as a parent, coach, volunteer firefighter and friend, I thought it would be best to share this with you, so you can once again talk to your children about the effects of drugs and how easy it could be to take drugs without knowing it, until it is too late. I worry, just as each of you do about kids and drugs and all the problems our kids today are faced with. So please talk with your children about this newest threat to get children addicted to drugs! http://www.ky3.com/news/6626012.html Click above for a news article about this from just across the state line in Missouri.What typically is not in this part of the country is now not too far from us here in Northwest Arkansas. Take care, God Bless and I've said a prayer that none of our kids will ever be faced with taking or being addicted to drugs!
  Analysis: Drug enforcement officials confirm that pink-tinted varieties of crystal meth do exist, but reports of strawberry-flavored methamphetamine ('Strawberry Quick') remain unsubstantiated.
  In March 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced it had received reports of drug traffickers offering candy-flavored methamphetamine for sale in western and midwestern states from California to Minnesota in the form of colorful crystals resembling Pop Rocks.
  The first such report had been issued three months earlier by the Nevada Department of Public Safety after samples of what narcotics agents believed to be strawberry-flavored meth — nicknamed 'Strawberry Quick' — were confiscated in a drug raid. State officials speculated that illegal drug manufacturers were experimentally reformulating crystal meth by adding strawberry and other sweet flavorings to make the bitter-tasting, highly addictive stimulant more attractive to potential teenage customers.
  After several months of following up on these reports, however, DEA officials told reporters they 'hadn't seen much' in the way of actual seizures of flavored methamphetamine and that the DEA itself had yet to seize or analyze any of the stuff at all.
  As of June 2007, experts were speculating that local drug enforcement agencies may have confused samples of colored meth — which is quite common and accounted for by dyes present in the raw ingredients — for what they took to be a new, flavored variety of the drug. Jeanne Cox, executive director of the Meth Project Foundation, summarized the quandary in a statement to the drug policy website JoinTogether.org: 'We are all still trying to figure out what's going on with strawberry meth and if it really exists.' Meanwhile, the waters were further muddied by reports that drug dealers in California had begun marketing new, strawberry- and coconut-flavored varieties of cocaine. In July 2008 the DEA confirmed receiving samples of pink- and off-white-tinted cocaine (not methamphetamine) with a 'generic, sweet, fruity odor.' 'Although flavored 'hard' drugs (notably 'strawberry meth') have received extensive press in the mass media,' the July 2008 report went on to say, 'to date very few such exhibits have been submitted to the DEA Laboratories.'
  10/31/08 - According to DEA public affairs officer Barbara Wetherell, the agency has found no evidence to substantiate that Strawberry Quick or any other form of flavored methamphetamine exists. 'This is an urban myth,' she told ColumbusLocalNews.com in a story published Oct. 31, 2008. 'We surveyed all of our offices yesterday (Oct. 30) and we found nothing. This is just one of those emails.'
  • A new version of the alert tagged 'Halloween Warning' began circulating in Oct. 2007.
  • A new version on a Memorial Physician Services letterhead began circulating in Dec. 2012.

  Also known as 'The Stuffed Baby'
  As told by a reader:
  A woman and her 4 year old son are visiting a border town on the Mexican side of the Texas/Mexico border. As they are walking towards the border crossing to return to the U.S., a man runs up to her and takes her child. She immediately runs to the authorities and a search ensues.
  The lady and the authorities begin walking among the cars looking for her son. The woman spots her child in a truck a couple of rows over. Her son is laying his head on the shoulders of man and appears to be sleeping.
  As the authorities close in on the vehicle, the driver jumps out of line and makes a run for it. As they are driving off, the passenger opens his door and dumps the child out into the street. As the woman and the authorities reach the child they find, to their horror, that the child has not only been murdered but has been cut open and illegal drugs have been put inside his body.
  It appears that the persons in the vehicle were drug smugglers and had decided to kidnap a child, kill them and place the drugs in the body. They would then hold the child as they approached the border and the border agents would think that the child was quietly sleeping on the shoulder of the passenger.

  Text of a forwarded email received in 1998:
  My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas, who with her husband was planning a weekend trip across the Mexican border for a shopping spree.
  At the last minute their baby sitter canceled, so they had to bring along their two year old son with them. They had been across the border for about an hour when the baby got free and ran around the corner. The mother went chasing, but the boy had disappeared. The mother found a police officer who told her to go to the gate and wait.
  Not really understanding the instructions, she did as she was instructed. About 45 minutes later, a man approached the border carrying the boy. The mother ran to him, grateful that he had been found. When the man realized it was the boy's mother, he dropped the boy and ran himself. The police were waiting for him and got him.
  The boy, dead, in the 45 minutes he was missing, was cut open, ALL of his insides removed and his body cavity stuffed with COCAINE.
  The man was going to carry him across the border as if he were asleep.
  A two year old boy, dead, discarded as if he were a piece of trash for somebody's cocaine.

  Analysis: It's always a treat to see a well-worn urban legend retooled for circulation on the Internet. Such is the case with a familiar horror story dating from the early 1970s claiming that drug smugglers have been known to use the corpses of abducted, murdered children to transport their illegal goods across national borders. We first encountered the version immediately above 1998. It continues to circulate to this day.
  Customs and law enforcement officials tell us the story isn't true. In all the decades this grisly legend has been in circulation, no real instances matching the descriptions above have been confirmed or documented.
  The legend, or the bare bones of it, anyway, got its first mainstream media airing in 1985 when the Washington Post recounted it as factual in the interests of livening up a feature about crime problems in Miami. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand noted in his mid-'80s collection of urban legends, The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton, 1986), the Post quickly found out that the story was untrue and retracted it a week later.
  The published correction read, in part:
  In the opening paragraph of an article last Monday on crime in Miami, the Washington Post recounted a story that cannot be substantiated. The story, told to a Post reporter several years ago by a Miami undercover agent, involves the smuggling of cocaine into the United States in the body of a dead baby.
  Clifton Stallings, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, said 'the story has been in circulation for some time. No one at Customs in Miami can verify it.' - Washington Post , March 30, 1985
  One customs official told the Post he had heard the story as long ago as 1973. As it was told in those days, he said, a suspiciously immobile child was spotted by an attendant on a flight from Colombia to Miami. Customs agents investigated and found that the baby, apparently deceased for some time, had been 'cut open, stuffed with cocaine and sewn shut.' It was considered a prime example of just how ruthless of international drug traffickers can be.
  As told on the Internet, it has became a much more compelling story. Set just across the U.S.-Mexico border and recounted in true 'friend of a friend' fashion ('My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas,' a frequently shared variant begins), the cautionary tale now carries a dual moral message: Drugs are evil, and never let your children out of your sight. Represented as a parent's 'true' nightmare, the online version concluded with a prayer that the story would convince people to stop using drugs. The more likely result is that has reinforced many people's already well-entrenched fears.

"The Knockout Perfume","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/two_sniffs.htm","2017-01-06 00:57:34","  By David Emery
  A scary story making the Internet rounds since 1999 claims that criminals in the U.S. and elsewhere are using perfume samples spiked with ether or some kind of 'knockout drug' to render victims unconscious before assaulting them and/or stealing their valuables.
  Versions of this urban legend continue to circulate via email and social media. A Twitter message from 2015 is as follows:
  Pls if anyone stops U and ask if you're interested in some perfume and gives u a paper to smell, pls don't! It's a new scam, the paper is laced with drugs. You'll pass out so they can kidnap, rob or do worse things to you. Pls forward to all friends and family..Save a life please. This was received from a Senior police officer this morning. Take note and alert everyone you want to protect. This is not a joke please. Pass on to family and friends. This is from the UK.
  The closest any of these reports has come to being confirmed was the case of Bertha Johnson of Mobile, Alabama , who told police in November 1999 that she was robbed of $800 after sniffing a cologne sample offered by a stranger and subsequently passing out in her car.
  continue reading below our video
  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Toxicological tests revealed no foreign substances in Johnson's blood, however.
  Although the details have morphed over time, more recent versions of the story echo early news reports about the alleged Alabama incident. Instead of cologne, the tainted sample is now said to be perfume. Instead of an unknown soporific substance, the knockout drug is now said to be ether. Interestingly, the main moral message of the story, which was originally 'Beware of parking lot scammers,' has evolved into 'If I hadn't read this warning, I could have been a victim too. And so could you!'
  It's typical for rumors, hoaxes, and urban legends to change as they're passed from person to person (or inbox to inbox). As anyone who has ever played the children's game of 'Telephone' can attest, perception and memory are fallible, and people tend to misremember and/or misreport what they've heard. Moreover, it's in the nature of storytelling (and storytellers) to creatively enhance a yarn to make it more impactful. These processes can be seen at work in the tale of 'The Knock-Out Perfume.'
  On Nov. 8, 1999, the Mobile, Alabama police department issued this press release :
  Local media jumped on the story. A Nov. 10 article in the Mobile Register quoted Johnson as saying that her assailant offered her a $45 bottle of cologne for the bargain price of $8 and talked her into to sniffing a sample. She did, once, and detected nothing odd about the aroma. But when she sniffed it a second time, she said, she lost consciousness. The next thing Johnson knew, she was sitting in another parking lot miles away from where she'd started, dazed, confused, and missing $800 in cash.
  'I feel like I got flimflammed out of something that I should have known better than to even look out the window at her,' Johnson told the Register .
  Within days of the incident, the story of Bertha Johnson's parking lot misadventure was all over the internet.
  Bertha Johnson's firsthand report of her alleged run-in with a cologne scammer inspired an anonymously-written email cautioning all women to beware of parking lot vendors offering samples of cut-rate cologne. While it nailed some of the reported facts correctly, it omitted others completely — the name of the victim, for example, as well as the name of the city in which the incident supposedly happened.
  These omissions may have dampened the email's credibility somewhat. In general, narratives are more believable the more specific they are. But minus some of the particulars the story took on an air of universality as if to say: this could happen to anyone, anywhere, even you , in your hometown.
  Subject: Fwd: Cologne sniffing Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1999 08:54:37 -0600 Watch out - this is for real!!!!!!!
  I just heard on the radio about a lady that was asked to sniff a bottle of perfume that another woman was selling for $8.00. (In a mall parking lot) She told the story that it was her last bottle of perfume that regularly sells for $49.00 but she was getting rid of it for only $8.00, sound legitimate?
  That's what the victim thought, but when she awoke she found out that her car had been moved to another parking area and she was missing all her money that was in her wallet (total of $800.00). Pretty steep for a sniff of perfume!
  Anyway, the perfume wasn't perfume at all, it was some kind of ether or strong substance to cause anyone who breathes the fumes to black out.
  SO beware..... Christmas time is coming and we will be going to malls shopping and we will have cash on us.
  Ladies, please don't be so trusting of others and beware of your surroundings- ALWAYS! Obey your instincts!
  *Please pass this on to your friends, sisters, mothers and all the women in your life you care about....... we can never be too careful!!!!*
  More variants appeared almost instantly, usually localizing the story in places where no such crimes had been reported. One version sent later that same month bore the false preamble, 'This happened in St. Louis.'
  In early December a lengthier version emerged. A woman was approached in a Walmart parking lot by two young men hawking 'designer perfume, it said,' for only $8 a bottle (as in the original version). In this variant the potential victim is said to have declined to sniff the product, and escaped unharmed. Of course, the email strongly urged that it be passed on to to friends, loved ones, and co-workers.
  Subject: Parking lot weirdos This was forwarded to me - you may be interested:
  This is quite strange to hear this story because last month I was approached in the Wal-Mart (on Beckly) parking lot by two young men who were selling designer perfume. They stated that it was the excess of a cosmetic show and it was $8.00. I noticed one young mans distinct accent. I asked him if he was from Kentucky. He replied yes. He asked me if I was sure I didn't want to smell the perfume and I once again said no then got into my car. I did two stupid things. First I spoke/conversed with a stranger at 9:00 at night in a parking lot. Second I allowed a stranger into my space without realizing he was moving closer to me. I was on my guard.
  The Walmart version was still going strong when yet another variant appeared describing yet another new incident, this one having allegedly occurred in the parking lot of a Target store in Plano, Texas. In this rendering, disaster is once again averted when the would-be victim rebuffs the salesman's advances before he even tells her what he's selling. The warning is all the more frightening, however, because it gives the impression that similar crimes are being perpetrated all over the United States.
  In January 2000 someone completely rewrote the text emphasizing the 'close call' scenario and crediting earlier versions of the email with preventing more such crimes from taking place:
  Come April 2000, another report of an incident in a Walmart parking lot is appended to the foregoing version. Note that the two males described in this variant are neither hawking perfume nor asking anyone to sniff a sample. They merely inquire as to the kind of perfume the narrator is wearing:
  I just wanted to pass along that I was approached yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 p.m. in the Walmart parking lot at Forest Drive by 2 males asking what kind of perfume I was wearing. I didn't stop to answer them and kept walking toward the store. At the same time I remembered this email. The men continued to stand between parked cars -- I guess to wait on someone else to hit on. I stopped a lady going toward them, pointed at them, and told her what they might ask and NOT to let them get near her. When that happened, the men and a lady (I don't know where she came from!) started walking the other way toward their car parked in far corner of the parking lot. I thank Jane Shirey for passing this along -- it might have saved me from a robbery. I'm passing this along to you'all so you can warn the women in your life to watch out for this... Cathy
  This wordy variation, which also appeared in late April 2000, describes yet another close call, though this time the story is completely secondhand. It's set in Kansas City:
  Two weekends ago, Mom, Melody and I were shopping at The Home Place at about 95th & Metcalf and while I was driving around the parking lot looking for the closest parking spot, we saw a man individually approach two single women and speak to them. They both just kept walking and wouldn't have anything to do with him.
  When we got into the store we saw one of the women that he spoke with and so curiosity getting the best of us we went up to her and explained that we'd seen the man approach her in the parking lot and we were wondering what he wanted. She then told us she was so scared that she had to sit down so we found the section with lawn furniture and we all sat down.
  She explained that just a few days prior she had received and e-mail about a man approaching you in a store parking lot asking if you'd like to smell a perfume, explaining that he's got all of the latest fragrances at drastically reduced prices and that he's sure you'll like this one (as he hands you the bottle) you take it and smell it and pass out because it's ether, not perfume. She said that was this man's exact line and that when she saw him pull a bottle out from his jacket, she said don't open that bottle or I'll scream and call the police on my cell phone. Well, we walked her to her car when we were all done shopping so she didn't have to go back out there by herself and we talked about it for a few minutes.
  The knockout perfume legend took the form of an omnibus version in 2000, including a new scenario that supposedly took place at a gas station in Des Moines, Iowa, followed by two of the previous versions.
  I received this email from a friend!
  I was pumping gas at the Texaco station at Merle Hay and Douglas approximately a week and a half ago and a young girl walked up to me and asked if I'd like to sample some perfume scents. She said that they had all the latest fragrances. I looked over at her car which was a turquoise sub-compact and her boyfriend (?) was rooting through the trunk. I declined, saying that I had to get back to work. She said again that they had all the latest scents and it wouldn't take long. I again declined and went inside to pay for my gas. She said, 'Thanks anyway', and went back to her car. When I pulled out, the two were just sitting there in the car. She smiled and waved. I thought it was an odd thing at the time, but the note below really brings it home that it could have been part of this indeed frightening scenario. I don't know WHAT they had in mind, but I can verify that this happened to me here in Des Moines. Please be careful,ladies.
  In true folkloric fashion, not one of the anecdotes you've just read is supported by anything more than hearsay, and anonymous hearsay at that. It doesn't necessarily follow that every report is false, but skepticism is in order.
  The moral message people are conveying by amplifying and spreading this legend is a familiar one, amount really to little more plain old common sense: 'Be careful out there.' That's a good message and a wise policy, but we have to question whether repeating frightful stories with little or no basis in fact is the best way to inspire prudent behavior.
  Urban legends often take the form of cautionary tales, but it would be a mistake to assume that they always actually function as such. Urban legends thrive, mainly, because they're emotionally gripping stories. To the extent that they serve any social purpose at all, it's probably more catharsis than anything — providing a belly laugh when we're blue or a bone-chilling scare to release pent-up tension. Plus, don't forget, there's an all-too-human pleasure to be had by provoking these reactions in others.
  In days gone by, people sat around for hours in the glow of a campfire scaring the pants off one another with horror stories for no other reason than that they enjoyed it. Human nature hasn't changed. We still enjoy scaring each other, only now we do it by the glow of a computer screen instead of a crackling fire.

  Netlore Archive: North Carolina man takes out fire insurance on pricey stash of rare cigars; he smokes them and files claim, according to an urban legend circulating since the 1960s. Who do you think prevailed in court?
  This story is decades old and likely originated as a joke. A much briefer version appeared in a 1965 toastmaster's manual and was apparently the direct inspiration of the earliest Internet variant, posted in a Usenet discussion in February 1996:
  Here's the same tale set in North Carolina in this Usenet version dated February 1997:
  A North Carolina man, having bought several expensive cigars, insured them against... get this... fire. After he had smoked them, he then decided that he had a claim against the insurance company and filed. The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigar normally. The man sued. The judge stated that since the company had insured the cigars against fire, they were obligated to pay. After the man accepted payment for his claim, the company then had him arrested for... arson.
  As the story traveled via email, it grew longer and more detailed, and by 1997 the latter-day version set in Charlotte, NC had become standard. David Boraks, a reporter for the Charlotte Observer , tried vainly to authenticate it. 'Somewhat sheepishly,' he wrote, 'I've tried to verify the cigar story. But searches of court records and newspaper files fail to turn up a single case or N.C. news article matching the incident.' Not that anyone should be surprised.
  A new variant claiming the scheming cigar aficionado was himself a lawyer began circulating in mid-2002 Here's an email contributed anonymously in 1997:
  FW: Subject: Our wonderful legal system
  A Charlotte, North Carolina man, having purchased a case of rare, very expensive cigars, insured them against (get this) fire! Within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of fabulous cigars, and having yet to make a single premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company.
  In his claim, the man stated that he had lost the cigars 'in a series of small fires.' The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in a normal fashion. The man sued -- and won! In delivering his ruling, the judge stated that since the man held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that the cigars would be insured against fire, without defining what it considered to be unacceptable fire, it was obligated to compensate the insured for his loss.
  Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company grudgingly accepted the judge's ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in the fires. After the man cashed his check, however, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used as evidence against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning the rare cigars and sentenced to 24 consecutive one-year terms.
  So don't piss off your insurance company!

"An Urban Legend Come to Life?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/needle-stick.htm","2015-10-28 13:12:34","  By David Emery
  In July 1999, police in Bangkok hunted for a man accused of stabbing several women in the back with a needle and shouting 'You've got AIDS now!' in separate incidents over a period of days.
  It wasn't known whether the needle used in the attacks was actually contaminated with HIV. According to Agence France-Presse coverage, Bangkok health authorities said there was less than a one-percent chance that any of the victims could have been infected this way.
  Only two months earlier, a similar incident was reported in Towson, Maryland. A woman checking the oil in her vehicle at a service station was approached by a panhandler who allegedly stabbed her with a needle and said 'Welcome to reality, you have HIV.' The man was arrested, but it wasn't immediately known if he had the AIDS virus himself.
  Following the Maryland attack, a TV news report ventured an explanation as to why the incident sounded so familiar to many people: 'Warnings of similar attacks with HIV tainted needles have been circulating on the Internet,' it said.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  'Patrons at this gas station were shocked to learn, what sounded like an Internet hoax could happen here.'
  What they read on the Internet wouldn't have been a hoax, precisely, but it certainly qualified as an urban legend .
  The Internet warnings were based on word-of-mouth rumors circulating since the late 1990s. They described random needle-stick attacks allegedly perpetrated in darkened public places -- movie theaters or night clubs, for example -- by unseen assailants who left behind a calling card saying 'Welcome to the world of AIDS' or 'Welcome to the HIV club.' These stories were actually false, so far as authorities were able to determine, but clearly the people who spread them believed them to be true.
  The similarities between the real-life incidents reported in Bangkok and Maryland and the urban legends that foreshadowed them are too close for comfort -- right down to the chilling punchline. They do, in a general way, comprise a 'legend come to life.' But it's important to note the dissimilarities, too. Most importantly, the real-life attackers did not attack in secret and hide their identities. They assaulted their victims face-to-face, in broad daylight. It is claimed in Internet rumors that people have contracted AIDS as a result of such attacks. We don't yet know the fates of the real-life victims, but doctors say the likelihood of their being infected in this way is remote.
  It's crucial to maintain the distinction between what is fact and what is folklore because, while it's accurate to say there is a grain of truth to the legends, it's simply false to assert that the recent incidents 'prove them true.' The perpetrators of the subsequent crimes were copycats, merely imitating the same stories we'd all already heard (as a matter of fact, tall tales about HIV exposures culminating in the punchline 'Welcome to the world of AIDS' date back at least 10 years).
  This means that people who circulate email warnings about sneak attacks with contaminated needles in movie theaters and night clubs are spreading falsehoods and frightening people needlessly. They may think they're being helpful by sounding an alarm, but it does no one any good to confuse reality with fiction by making the threat seem more dire and pervasive than it actually is.
  Sometimes the truth is scary enough, as is.
","Urban Legends: Crime"
"Welcome to the World of AIDS","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/world_of_aids.htm","2016-03-07 02:25:29","  Viral scare story making the rounds says random victims in at least two different countries were unknowingly injected with the AIDS virus in crowded movie theaters and night clubs.
  Originally published May 21, 1998
  Nothing is safe any more!
  Have a few drinks at a bar, you wake up missing a kidney. Flash your headlights at a passing car, gang members open fire on you in a drive-by initiation rite.
  Now, it appears, you can't even go to the movies without putting your life at risk — this according to the latest scare story making the email rounds.
  Here's an example. Read on...
  Welcome to the world of urban folklore! What you have just read, albeit digitally transmitted, is a classic urban legend. More precisely, it's a new variant of a twenty-odd-year-old legend, that of 'AIDS Mary.'
  AIDS Mary
  Like her historical prototype Typhoid Mary , AIDS Mary's claim to fame was spreading a deadly disease. First documented by folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand in his 1989 book, Curses! Broiled Again! (W.W. Norton), the birth of the AIDS Mary story coincided with the most virulent phase of the HIV epidemic in America. It took the form of a cautionary tale .
  After a night of casual sex with a woman he doesn't know, the story went, a man wakes up the next morning to find the words 'Welcome to the world of AIDS' scrawled in lipstick across his bathroom mirror.
  Supposedly, the woman had contracted the fatal disease from a previous lover and swore to purposely pass it on to every man she could seduce.
  In reality, there was no such person as 'AIDS Mary.' Notwithstanding the documentation of several cases of HIV carriers knowingly putting multiple partners at risk for the disease by sleeping with them — including one involving an HIV-positive woman who claimed she had unprotected sex with at least two dozen men as an act of revenge — the character of AIDS Mary was a folk invention, an imaginative expression, if you will, of the fear and ignorance that surrounded the epidemic in the mid-1980s.
  AIDS by 'stealth injection'
  New variants circulating since the late 1990s retain the original punchline — 'Welcome to the world of AIDS' — but the plot of the story has taken a decidedly darker and creepier turn. It's no longer the indulgence in careless sex with a stranger that seals the victims' doom — it's simply a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent people are being randomly chosen for infection by anonymous villains, we are told. It's AIDS by 'stealth injection.'
  Another version of the updated storyline is played out in this forwarded email:
  Folklorists often describe urban legends as 'friend-of-a-friend tales' because their subject matter is purely hearsay, usually credited to a thirdhand source. Both of the specimens above display this characteristic.
  'An experience of a friend of my brother's wife left me speechless,' writes the author of the Bombay version (who turns out to be anything but speechless).
  'This is not a joke or an urban myth ,' pleads the author of the British version, 'it's actually happened to somebody Fi (the woman whose email I'm using) knows.'
  None of the factual claims in these tales are corroborated with evidence. Some are downright ludicrous — for example, the claim made in the Bombay version that the victim got a blood test 'a couple of weeks' after the incident and was found to be HIV-positive. Highly unlikely. As of this writing (1998), the incubation period before detectable antibodies emerge in a patient exposed to HIV is typically four to eight weeks, often longer.
  We are also asked to swallow the improbable claim that police told one of the victims that hers was only 'one of the many such cases they had received.' If that's so, why hasn't the press taken an interest? One would think that multiple instances of HIV infection caused by hypodermic-wielding thugs in at least two countries would have incited a full-tilt media frenzy by now. Apparently, reputable news organizations don't find it credible.
  Or maybe they're all just waiting for Matt Drudge to break the story.

"Does Wasp Spray Work for Self-Defense?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/a/wasp_spray.htm","2016-01-09 16:11:00","  By David Emery
  A viral message circulating since 2009 advocates using wasp spray for self-defense instead of pepper spray because it's allegedly more effective and works at a greater distance. There's precious little proof that this is true, however. Apart from some YouTube videos and anecdotal claims from anonymous parties, no real research has been done.
  Description: Email rumor / Viral text Circulating since: June 2009 Status: Questionable (details below)
  Example #1: Email contributed by Marv B., January 20, 2010:
  Wasp Spray
  A friend who is a receptionist in a church in a high risk area was concerned about someone coming into the office on Monday to rob them when they were counting the collection. She asked the local police department about using pepper spray and they recommended to her that she get a can of wasp spray instead.
  The wasp spray, they told her, can shoot up to twenty feet away and is a lot more accurate, while with the pepper spray, they have to get too close to you and could overpower you. The wasp spray temporarily blinds an attacker until they get to the hospital for an antidote. She keeps a can on her desk in the office and it doesn't attract attention from people like a can of pepper spray would. She also keeps one nearby at home for home protection... Thought this was interesting and might be of use.
  FROM ANOTHER SOURCE
  On the heels of a break in and beating that left an elderly woman in Toledo dead, self defense experts have a tip that could save your life..
  Val Glinka teaches self-defense to students at Sylvania Southview High School . For decades, he's suggested putting a can of wasp and hornet spray near your door or bed.
  Glinka says, 'This is better than anything I can teach them.'
  Glinka considers it inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or pepper spray. The cans typically shoot 20 to 30 feet; so if someone tries to break into your home, Glinka says, 'spray the culprit in the eyes'. It's a tip he's given to students for decades.
  It's also one he wants everyone to hear. If you're looking for protection, Glinka says look to the spray.
  'That's going to give you a chance to call the police; maybe get out.'
  Maybe even save a life.
  Please share this with all the people in your life.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: U.S. residents tempted to avail themselves of this Internet-recommended self-defense option by stockpiling wasp spray would do well consider that federal law prohibits the use of any pesticide 'in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.' Likewise, some states forbid carrying substances for self-protection that aren't specifically authorized for that purpose. There could be significant liability issues involved.
  The main ingredient of pepper spray is capsaicin, an oil extracted from chili peppers which temporarily causes severe irritation of the eyes and lungs, producing a strong burning sensation and difficulty breathing.
  Wasp sprays, on the other hand, consist of one or more insecticides such as pyrethrum or propoxur. While the toxic side-effects of such chemicals do, in fact, include eye and lung irritation in humans, they are chemical poisons, the main purpose of which is killing pests.
  Notwithstanding variations among specific products (of which there are many), it's probably true that wasp and hornet sprays in general, because they're manufactured for use at greater distances, project further and more accurately than pepper sprays , which typically have a range of six to 10 feet. How reliably wasp and hornet sprays would actually work as a deterrent against human assailants is bound to vary, however, given differences in formulation and the fact that they weren't made for that use in the first place.
  To my knowledge, no one has ever tested or documented the effectiveness of insecticide sprays for self-defense. Until they do, prudence would dictate refraining from using it that way.
  One reader who accidentally received a dose of wasp spray while using it around his home told me he was surprised at how little irritation he felt. 'A gust of wind caused a good splash of the spray to come right back into my right eye,' he wrote. 'I panicked and started to run to a source of water, only to find there was no adverse reaction at all, no more than being squirted with a water pistol. It took me at least ten seconds to get to the water, and I rinsed it off, and never felt anything from it.'
  Update: While we still lack any academic research, various videos have appeared on the Internet putting these claims to the test. In Pepper Spray vs. Wasp Spray Challenge (2015) , a subject is given tasks to complete after being sprayed with each item. Wasp spray was found to be significantly less incapacitating than pepper spray. In Wasp Spray vs. Pepper Spray (2012) , personal safety expert David Nance concluded that wasp spray is impractical both to carry and to use as a self-defense tool.

"Walmart Cash Back Scam - Urban Legends","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/crime/fl/Walmart-Cash-Back-Scam-Urban-Legends.htm","2016-08-15 01:25:55","  By David Emery
  Online rumors circulating since November 2004 claim cashiers at Walmart and other retail stores routinely steal money from customers by surreptitiously triggering the 'cash back' option during credit or debit card transactions. This accusation is unsubstantiated.
  For a scam so allegedly widespread and easy to pull off, there's precious little in the way of evidence to prove that it often occurs, if ever.
  A search of newspaper archives going back 20 years retrieved only one confirmed crime report even vaguely resembling this issue, and in that case a grocery clerk was caught double-charging customers who verbally requested cash back at a Solebury, Pennsylvania supermarket in 2007.
  A November 24, 2009 article in the Des Moines Register cited an anecdotal report of a fraudulent cash back transaction at a Des Moines retail store, but the details were sketchy and it's unclear whether the incident actually amounted to an attempted crime or was merely a cashier error.
  Point-of-Sale systems are more sophisticated than they once were, making it all but impossible for unscrupulous cashiers to put through cash-back transactions without the customers' knowledge. In most modern retail stores, including Walmart, customers swipe their own debit or credit cards and must personally initiate and confirm cash-back requests using the same device. The crime could conceivably occur at check-out stands where the clerk swipes the customer's card and enters cash-back requests manually, but these circumstances are becoming more rare.
  These alerts, however, do offer one good bit of advice: Examine your receipts before leaving any commercial establishment there's no mistake or fishy charge.
  Here's sample email text contributed by S. Smith on Aug. 3, 2009:
  FW: Pay attention to your receipts
  Pay attention and look at your WALMART receipts...any receipts when you use ANY debit card or credit card
  THIS IS TRUE! It happened to me at Wal-Mart (Supercenter Store #1279, 10411 N Freeway 45, Houston , TX 77037 ) a month ago.
  I bought a bunch of stuff, over $150, and I glanced at my receipt as the cashier was handing me the bags. I saw a cash-back of $40. I told her I didn't request a cash back and & to delete it. She said I'd have to take the $40 because she couldn't delete it. I told her to call a supervisor. The supervisor came and and said I'd have to take it. I said NO! Taking the $40 would be a cash advance against my Discover and & I wasn't paying interest on a cash advance!!!!! If they couldn't delete it then they would have to delete the whole order. So the supervisor had the cashier delete the whole order and & re-scan everything! The second time I looked at the electronic pad before I signed and & a cash-back of $20 popped up. At that point I told the cashier and & she deleted it. The total came out right. The cashier agreed that the electronic pad must be defective. Obviously the cashier knew the electronic pad was defective because she NEVER offered me the $40 at the beginning. Can you imagine how many people went through before me and & at the end of her shift how much money she pocketed?
  Just to alert everyone. My co worker went to Milford, DE Walmart last week. She had her items rung up by the cashier. The cashier hurried her along and didn't give her a receipt. She asked the cashier for a receipt and the cashier was annoyed and gave it to her. My co worker didn't look at her receipt until later that night. The receipt showed that she asked for $20 cash back. SHE DID NOT ASK FOR CASH BACK. My co worker called Walmart who investigated but could not see the cashier pocket the money. She then called her niece who works for the bank and her niece told her this. There is a scam going on. The cashier will ask for cash back and hand it to her friend who is the next person in line. Please, Please, check your receipts right away when using debit cards. The store has the cashier under investigation now. We can only pray that she is caught very soon.
  I am adding to this. My husband and I were in WalMart North Salisbury and paying with credit card when my husband went to sign the credit card signer he just happen to notice there was a $20 cash back added. He told the cashier that he did not ask nor want cash back and she said this machine has been messing up and she canceled it. We really didn't think anything of it until we read this email. Please be aware.
  Here's an additional sample email about the purported scam l contributed by Ells on June 15, 2006
  Fw: WALMART
  I have actually seen this one...DON'T KNOW HOW THE CASHIER GOT THE CASH BACK WITH OUT ME USING MY PIN NUMBER BUT SHE DID!
  Subject: Wal Mart
  A few weeks ago I got an e-mail about a scam that the cashiers at Wal Mart are pulling... you use your debit card w/o requesting cash back and the cashier does something on her/his machine that requests cash back and then puts your cash in their pocket... Well, it just happened to me at the Wal Mart on Rte. 40... I know darn well I hit no for cash back, watched the touch screen light up for 'NO' cash back...but had I looked away I wouldn't have seen the next screen light up for $80 cash back.
  I looked at it and said, '$80 cash back!!' I hit 'NO'...the cashier says, 'There must be something wrong with the machine b/c you're the 2nd person that happened to; the $80 button must be right above the word No.'
  No, its not...the 'No' button is at the very bottom of the screen, nowhere near the dollar amounts for cash back... I just said, 'GIVE ME MY $80!!' 'GIVE-ME-MY-$80!!' so she goes back in the drawer for it... I was heated...but I always look at my receipt, I don't always watch the screen. But had I walked away and went back she may have tried to argue with me... Nevertheless, the e-mail is true...they are trying to cheat you when you use your debit card and since I know we all at SSA frequent that Walmart, I wanted to let you know its happening up there.
