  Subject: Russian gift to the U.S. I had never heard of this before receiving an e-mail. Wonder why the press hasn’t report it? This is the 'TEAR DROP' made and installed by the Russians to honor those who died in 9 11 and a statement against terrorism. It is very impressive. The tear drop is lined up with the Statue of Liberty.

  True. The images are authentic. Variously known as 'The Tear of Grief,' 'The Teardrop Memorial,' and 'The Memorial at Harbor View Park' — as well as by its official name, 'To the Struggle Against World Terrorism' — this monument to the victims of 9/11 was built by Russian artist Zurab Tsereteli on the waterfront of Bayonne Harbor, New Jersey and publicly dedicated on September 11, 2006. It was, in the words of Vladimir Putin, 'a gift from the Russian people.' The monument comprises a 100-foot-tall bronze tower with a jagged split down the middle and a 40-foot-long stainless steel teardrop suspended in the gap.
  It stands on an 11-sided slab of black marble carved with the names of every person who died in the September 11 attack, as well as the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The brightly lit memorial is visible even at night from the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park, the Staten Island Ferry, and other locations around the Hudson River. Though not well known in the United States, Zurab Tsereteli is renowned for his work in Russia, as well as public sculptures he has erected all around the world. He reportedly spent $12 million of his own money to complete the Bayonne Harbor monument.

"109-Pound Shrimp Caught in Florida","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/ss/109-Pound-Shrimp-Caught-in-Florida.htm","2016-08-23 06:44:46","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: September 2015 Status: Fake
  Analysis: This photo of a fisherman allegedly holding a 109-pound shrimp caught in waters off Florida has been circulating since 2010. It has appeared on Facebook, Twitter, various other social sites, and before that on a Spanish-language site claiming that the shrimp was caught in Spain. Before that it was supposedly hooked in Australia.
  Any number of stories have been made up to 'explain' the photo, which is suspect on any number of grounds, not the least of which is that if the critter actually did weigh 109 pounds it would take considerably more effort to hold it at arm's length than we see here (if you don't get what I mean, check out what it looks like when three guys are holding up a 109-pound catfish).
  For that matter, even if a shrimp did grow to be this huge, it wouldn't weigh 109 pounds, or even 50 pounds, or 25, or anywhere close to that. In a PBS News Hour segment about Asian tiger shrimp ( Penaeus monodon) , an invasive species found in greater and greater numbers in the Gulf of Mexico of late, it was reported that an extra-large specimen 'as long as a human forearm' might weigh as much as 11 ounces.
  Ounces, not pounds.
  To extrapolate, if you double that length — say, if the tiger shrimp measured twice as long as a human forearm — it might weigh 22 ounces, or around a pound-and-a-half.
  A shrimp three times the length of a human forearm — if such existed — could weigh a little over two pounds. At most.
  Given that the specimen in our photo looks to be about three feet in length, it's twice the size of any real shrimp ever caught (or would be, if real). In 2006, quite a fuss was made over a 16-inch-long black tiger shrimp caught off the coast of Colombia. In 2014, the Internet went gaga over an 18-inch-long mantis shrimp caught by someone fishing from a dock in Fort Pierce, Florida. Both were said by experts to be of 'record size.' I've found no reports of any non- prehistoric shrimp larger than those found anywhere on earth, ever.
  Given all the above, it's a foregone conclusion that the photo was manipulated. Never mind the preposterous weight attributed to the specimen, its physical dimensions betray the image as a hoax. The original snapshot must have shown the subject holding an ordinary fish of some kind. The'109-pound shrimp' was Photoshopped in after the fact, not only giving it an unreal appearance — it looks like the shrimp was cut and pasted in as an afterthought, doesn't it? — but degrading the overall quality of the image in the process.
  In July 2015 a 12-inch tiger shrimp was caught in the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. Local shrimpers claimed the larger shrimp that are increasingly showing up in Florida were farm-raised in North Carolina and escaped during Hurricane Hugo.
  In 2012 a foot-long tiger shrimp was caught off the coast of Louisiana. Scientists say the invasive species is on its way to becoming 'established' within 10 years and is most likely there to stay.
  In 2011 a ' giant tiger prawn ' was caught near Panama City, Florida ('tiger prawn' and 'tiger shrimp' seem to be used interchangeably in these media reports).
  The good news, for humans at any rate, is that they're both harmless and edible.

"Is This a Frozen "Alaskan Tree Frog"?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalkingdom/ss/Alaskan-Tree-Frog.htm","2016-01-17 21:53:10","  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: 2013? Status: Mislabeled (details below)
  Caption example #1:
  Alaskan tree frog. Freezes solid in winter, thaws in spring and hops off
  Caption example #2:
  This is what an Alaskan tree frog looks like. It freezes in winter, stopping its heart, then thaws in spring.
  Caption example #3:
  the Alaskan tree frog freezes and stops its heart rate completely. Thaws and comes back to life again when the conditions become favorable
  Analysis: Sorry, enthusiastic sharers, but the whimsical specimen in this photograph doesn't appear to be a real frog at all, much less a 'frozen Alaskan tree frog.' More likely, it's an iced-over ceramic garden ornament. Cute photo, to be sure, but circulating under false pretenses.
  There is, in fact, no such species as an 'Alaskan tree frog' — none that I could find in reference books on amphibians, at any rate — though it's true that scientists have identified a diminutive species named Rana sylvatica (commonly called a wood frog), that can survive Arctic temperatures for months at a time with up to two-thirds of its bodily fluids frozen solid.
  'Alaska wood frogs spend more time freezing and thawing outside than a steak does in your freezer and the frog comes back to life in the spring in better shape than the steak,' says University of Alaska Fairbanks grad student Don Larson, the lead author of a recent study on the freeze tolerance of the Alaska wood frog.
  How does the species accomplish such a feat, given that the freezing process normally damages and kills living tissues (think frostbite)?
  By overdosing on sugar, apparently. Researchers have discovered that wood frogs' bodies prepare for the coldest winter months by 'packing' their cells with glucose (blood sugar), which acts as a ' cryoprotectant ' to prevent tissues from drying out and collapsing when the water they contain turns to ice. According to Larson, wood frogs tracked in the wild proved able to endure below-zero temperatures for as many as 218 days straight with a 100 percent survival rate.
  Larson and co-author Brian Barnes believe their research may ultimately serve a more practical purpose, namely indicating ways to improve and extend the preservation of human organs for transplantation.
  Thank you, wood frog!

"Alligator and Deer in Cross Lake","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/alligators/ss/Alligator-and-Deer-in-Cross-Lake.htm","2016-01-17 20:02:10","  Synopsis: Viral photos purportedly taken at Cross Lake, Louisiana (or Lake Wiess in Alabama, or Lake Conroe in Texas, etc.) show an alligator swimming through the water with a full-grown deer in its jaws.
  Description: Viral images Circulating since: June 2004 Status: Authentic / Partly true
  Text example:
  Subject: FW: Swimming in Louisiana
  This was taken by a KTBS helicopter flying over Cross Lake! (For those of you who are not local, Cross Lake is in Shreveport, La.) That has to be a HUGE gator to have a whole deer in its mouth! Are you ready to go skiing on Cross Lake?! If you ski at the west end of the lake -- try not to fall.
  Email contributed by a reader Aug. 25, 2004
  Example #2:
  The  picture below, was taken by a KTBS helicopter flying over Lake Wiess about 90 miles north of Birmingham, Alabama. The helicopter pilot and the game warden were in communication via radios; following is a transcript of their conversation: 'Air1, have you a visual on the gator? Over.' 'Approaching inlet now; over.' 'Roger, Air1.' 'Gator sighted. Looks like it has a small animal in its mouth. Moving in; over.' 'Roger, Air1.' 'It's a deer!!!' 'Confirm, Air1! Did you say 'deer'? Over.' 'Roger. A deer, in its mouth. Looks like a full-sized buck. That's a BIG Gator! We're gonna need more men. Over.' 'Roger, Air1. Can you give me a idea on size of animal? Over.' It's big... 25 feet long..... at least!!! Please advise; gator is heading to inlet. Do I pursue? Over.'
  Email contributed by a reader Jan. 15, 2009
  Analysis: These photos showing a 12- to 14-foot-long alligator swimming off with a full-grown deer between its teeth are authentic, according to a press release put out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They were taken by district fire management officer Terri Jenkins on March 4, 2004.
  The various texts accompanying the photos on their viral rounds are complete fabrications, however. The photos weren't taken at Cross Lake in Louisiana, or Lake Wiess in Alabama, or any of the other places the different versions of the story say they were.
  Nor was the alligator in the photo 25 feet long, nor was there an amusing conversation between the helicopter pilot and a game warden recorded for posterity during the taking of the photos.
  According to Jenkins herself, she was about 40 miles south of Savannah, Georgia, on her way to start a prescribed fire at Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge , when she spotted the gator making off with its lunch from her helicopter (which, contrary to what the email says, does not belong to KTBS-TV in Shreveport).
  American alligators typically feed on smaller prey such as fish, snakes and small or infant mammals but have been known to catch and eat adult deer when hungry and smaller prey isn't available.
  Update: A June 2004 variant of the email, equally false, claims the photographs were taken by an officer of the Texas Forest Service on assignment at a game refuge in South Carolina.
  Update: A May 2006 variant claims the photos were taken by the WIS-TV 'News Hawk' helicopter flying over Lake Murray in South Carolina.

"","https://www.thebalance.com/becoming-a-marine-corps-pilot-3354348","","  1 Becoming a Marine Corps Pilot
  
  The process of becoming a Marine pilot is arduous and competitive.
  
  The following planes, helicopters, and hybrid machines are the aircraft of the Marine Corps.  Marine pilots are capable of flying supersonic jets, hover in VSTOL aircraft, fly propeller transport planes, and a variety of helicopters.
  
  USMC Fixed Wing Aircraft F/A 18 – Hornet – The dual mission of the Fighter / Attack mode the F/A-18 offers is of paramount importance to the missions of the Marine Corps:  fighter escort, enemy defenses suppression, air control, reconnaissance, and close air support of Marines on the ground.
  
  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (Lightning II) is the future of Marine Corp fighter / attack missions and will replace the F/A 18 Hornet in the near future. AV-8B Harrier – The Harrier is the Marines first Vertical / Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft (VSTOL).  Using adjustable jets, the plane can hover, take off, and land with little to no run way and attack anywhere.
  
  EA-6B Prowler – Electronic warfare of this jet enables Marines and Navy planes and helicopters to have air superiority.  The EA-6B Prowler detects, jams, and / or destroys enemy air defenses.
  
  KC-130 Super Hercules – The multi-versatile propeller transport and refueling plane operates in all environments with the mission capabilities that include:  Delivery of Marines, fuel, and cargo, medevac, humanitarian assistance, battlefield illumination and more. Helicopters of the Marine Corps
  
  CH-53E Super Stallion – Is the heavy lift helicopter of the Marine Corps and capable of lifting or carrying 16 tons of cargo (vehicles, supplies, personnel).  With its speed and agility and armament, the CH-53E is much more than just a heavy lifter.
  
  AH-1Z Super Cobra – The Cobra / Viper is the Marine Corps close air support helicopter.  Armed with rockets and guns, the AH-1 provided cover to advancing ground troops as well as escort of transport helicopters. UH-1Y Huey – The versatile fighting Huey helicopter provides combat support as well as medevac capabilities.  Some of the other missions is Close Air Support, Assault Support, Command and Control, and Aerial Reconnaissance. MV-22 Osprey – Is a hybrid transport plane and helicopter.  It has the range and speed of a turbo-prop plane and the maneuverability of a helicopter.  The unique tilt rotor systems allows for vertical / short take off and landing of up to 24 troops and gear.
  
  Though the Marines flying the drones are not pilots, they are skilled in operating the drones, communications, and target recognition.  They are still part of Marine Corps Aviation. Marine Aviators will be communicating with these in flight systems.
  
  RA-7B Shadow – Drone – Recent development of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  The Shadow is used to help Marines on the ground with reconnaissance, target acquisition, and relay of communications.
  
  Here are some of the hurdles prospective pilots have to clear:
  2 Education
  
  Pilots need at least a bachelor’s degree, earned either at a civilian college or university or through the U.S. Naval Academy, ROTC, or OCS. The Naval Academy graduates on average 20% of the class into the Marine Corps.
  3 Commissioning
  Pilots must be officers commissioned at the rank of second lieutenant. Prospective pilots should contact a local selection officer to inquire about the steps for becoming an officer in the Marine Corps and let the officer know they are interested in pursuing the Marine aviator track.
  4 Age Requirements
  Aviator candidates must be at least 18 years old when enlisting, at least 20 years old when entering an officer candidate program and no older than 27 years old when receiving their commissions.
  5 Citizenship
  
  Marines must be citizens of the United States. If a prospective Marine is not a citizen, he or she may apply to become one upon enlistment — regardless of time lived in the U.S. — due to an executive order signed by President Bush in 2002 expediting the naturalization process for members of the military.
  6 Testing
  Any Marine seeking entry into officer training programs must have a combined Math and English SAT score of at least 1,000, a composite ACT score of 22 or an Armed Forces Qualification Test score of at least 74 on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. He or she also must pass the Navy/Marine Corps Aviation Selection Test Battery to become a Marine pilot.
  7 Physical Condition
  Prospective pilots must be in good physical and psychological health and must take a physical.
  8 Flight School
  
  After completing Officer Training School or Platoon Leaders Class, an aviator candidate will have a guaranteed spot in flight school in Florida, where his or her training will proceed in stages: The Basic School - All Marine Officers attend The Basic School (TBS) in Quantico, Va, before moving onto pilot training.
  
  Pre-indoctrination: This six-week phase includes an introduction to aerodynamics, aviation physiology, engines, navigation and land and sea survival in classrooms at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla.
  
  Primary flight training: A candidate’s first in-air experience is at Whiting Field in Milton, Fla., in a T-34C. Prospective pilots each spend 67 hours in the air, including four solo flights, as well as 27 hours on a flight simulator. Another 166 hours of classroom work attending flight support lectures round out the instruction. At the close of this training, candidates are picked, partly based on grades and aptitude, for flight training on one of three aircraft: jets, helicopters or turbo-props.
  9 Flight School (Con't)
  Intermediate Training:
  Those selected to fly helicopters or turbo-props will receive an additional 26 hours of instruction on the T-34, with emphasis on radio and navigation training. Those selected to fly jets will proceed to the Naval Air Station in either Kingsville, Texas, or Meridian, Miss. There, they will take five weeks of ground school, including instruction in meteorology, visual flight rules and safety. From there, trainees will progress to the T-2C or T-45 for hands-on training in aerobatics, gunnery, radio communication and catapult take-offs.
  
  Advanced Training: Jet pilots will then spend 92 hours in the TA-4 or T-45, focusing on performing combat maneuvers and night flights. Those with a concentration in turbo-props will head to Corpus Christi, Texas, for a 20-week course that requires 88 hours flight time on the multi-engine T-44 Beech Queen Air. Another 20 hours of instruction using flight simulators and 182 hours of classroom time are also required. Those bound for helicopters will report to South Whiting Field to do their flight training on the TH-57B/C Bell Jet Ranger, where they’ll log another 116 hours in the air. After this phase, candidates finally earn their wings.

"Black and White Twins","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/fl/Black-and-White-Twins.htm","2016-08-21 02:29:23","  By David Emery
  Emailed images circulating since February 2006 show a pair of twin sisters — one black, the other white — born to a British couple who both had mixed-race parents. These images are authentic.
  The following images credited in online news stories to freelance photographer Gary Roberts, are authentic. The subjects are real as well — twins Kian and Remee Hodgson of Nottingham, England.
  According to a February 21, 2006 article in the London Daily Mail , Kian, who is dark-skinned and dark-haired, and Remee, who is light-skinned and fair-haired, were born in April 2005 to Kylie and Remi Hodgson, who themselves were born to mixed-race parents. Kylie noted:
  “I didn’t see them at first. They were both whisked away to be checked over and then the midwife came back and placed them both in my arms. I noticed that both of them had beautiful blue eyes, but whilst Remee’s hair was a blonde colour, Kian’s was black and she had darker skin.
  It seemed strange, but I was feeling so ill from the Caesarean that I didn’t really take it in at that stage. All that mattered was my precious daughters had arrived safely.
  But the following day, Kylee mentioned the colour difference to her mother. “I said to my mother that Remee’s skin was a lot lighter, and she told me that it would get darker as she got older. I had just assumed that both our babies would have the same skin tone as me.”
  While very rare, the phenomenon is not unknown, though it does entail a very particular combination of circumstances at the moment of conception. First, both parents must be of mixed race. Second, the twins must be fraternal (each conceived from a separate egg fertilized by separate sperm) as opposed to identical (both conceived from a single egg and sperm). Third, each sperm and egg must carry the genes for a particular skin color (i.e., black/black or white/white).
  The odds against it are indeed a million to one.
  As the twins grew, Remee’s skin became lighter, whilst Kian’s got darker. Remee’s eyes stayed blue and  Kian’s turned brown. Despite the differences in their appearance, the girls share a a very strong bond and are best friends.
  Another set of black and white twins were born in 1997 to a white father and a half-Jamaican mother. Lucy Aylmer has red hair and a very fair complexion and her twin Maria has brown hair with a caramel complexion.
  Sample Email About the Twins Here's an email contributed by Stacey B. on March 1, 2006:
  Subject: AMAZING TWINS...WOW!
  A mixed-race British mom gave birth to twins recently - one of each. No, not a boy and a girl. Two girls - one black, the other white. The odds of such a birth are about a million to one, experts said.

  A viral image and video purport to document the case of a female anthropologist named Susan McKinley, who failed to seek treatment for a rash and wound up with an infestation of larvae in her breast.
  Description: Viral image / Hoax Circulating since: 2003 Status: See below
  Example: Email contributed by Belinda P., April 20, 2006:
  Fwd: Wash before Wearing! It is horrible. Guys tell your wife, sisters, girlfriends, and girl cousins wash bra before wearing. ALL PLEASE WASH ALL BRAS, UNDERWEAR WHEN YOU BUY BEFORE WEARING THEM. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PARASITE IS IN OUR CLOTHES WHEN WE BUY THEM. FORWARD TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW.

  It has been reported that this is happening in Zimbabwe as well, please make sure you iron your undergarments before you wear them and make sure that your clothes are ironed when they are dry and not damp. The picture is horrible but I felt that I should share with you. After anthropologist Susan McKinley came back home from an expedition in South America, she noticed a very strange rash on her left breast. Nobody knew what it was and she quickly dismissed it believing that the holes would leave in time. Upon her return she decided to see a doctor after she started developing intense pains. The doctor, not knowing the exact severity of the disease, gave her antibiotics and special creams. As time lapsed the pain did not subside and her left breast became more inflamed and started to bleed. She decided to bandage her sores however as Susan's pain grew more intense she decided to seek help from a more certified doctor. Dr. Lynch could not diagnose the infection and told Susan to seek the aid of one of his colleagues who specialized in dermatology whom was sadly on vacation. She waited for two weeks and finally was able to react the dermatologist. Sadly,a life changing event was about to unfold during her appointment. To Miss McKinley's surprise, after she removed the bandages, they found larva growing and squirming within the pores and sores of her breast. Sometimes these wicked creatures would all together simultaneously move around into different crevices. What she didn't know was that the holes were in fact, deeper than she had originally thought for these larvae were feeding off the fat, tissue, and even milk canals of her bosom.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: This viral message has three distinct components:
  1. The text, which appears to have been fabricated. 2. The photograph, which also appears to have been fabricated. 3. The linked video, which is authentic, albeit completely unrelated to the text and image.
  The fabricated image first turned up on the Internet, uncaptioned, in June 2003. As David Mikkelson of Snopes.com observes, it appears to have been created by combining elements of two separate images, one of a female breast and the other of a lotus seed pod .
  The cautionary tale about 'anthropologist Susan McKinley' and the breast larvae infestation she supposedly experienced (also described as 'boob worms' and 'nipple bugs' in other versions of the story) was attached to the image by person(s) unknown in August 2003.
  The video — which demonstrates that larvae infestations of the breast, though extremely rare, do occur — was downloaded from the website of a medical journal in 2005 and attached to the already-circulating email, again by person(s) unknown. As originally published, it accompanied a scientific study entitled ' Furuncular Myiasis of the Breast Caused by the Larvae of the Tumbu Fly (Cordylobia Anthropophaga) .' The case, which was recorded in Nigeria, not South America, is described as follows:
  Please note that while the particulars of the 'Susan McKinley' email remain unsubstantiated and the story is almost certainly a fabrication, its anonymous author does appear to know a thing or two about the causes of furuncular myiasis of the breast. The email warns: 'Please make sure you iron your undergarments before you wear them and make sure that your clothes are ironed when they are dry and not damp.' Compare that to the journal article's explanation of how the 70-year-old patient in Nigeria was exposed to infestation: 'She usually spreads her washed dresses on a line near the bush and does not iron them before wearing them.'

  Example: Email contributed by Jolene W., Feb. 5, 2009:
  The word ' calico ' aptly describes the coloring of this handsome animal, though ' piebald ' is more often used.
  Piebald deer are white-tailed deer with a genetic defect resulting in a coat with asymmetrical white and brown (or white and black) patches. Experts say the anomaly is quite rare.
  Though piebald deer can presumably be found anywhere white-tailed deer are common — including Wisconsin, where the specimen in the photographs was allegedly killed — it so happens that this deer was actually bagged in east Texas.
  According to the deer hunting and management website Buck Manager , the 195-pound buck was 'harvested' on Nov. 2, 2008 (EXIF data embedded in the images confirms the photos were taken on that date) near Palestine, Texas by James Curtis of Belleville, Texas.
  Among the falsehoods one finds in the various captions accompanying these photos on the Internet are the claims that the deer was killed in Michigan, Arkansas, West Virginia, or Georgia, and that the carcass was sold to hunting outfitter Cabela's for $13,000.

"Card Trick: I Can Read Your Mind!","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/ss/Card-Trick-I-Can-Read-Your-Mind.htm","2016-08-22 02:12:53","  Here is a well-traveled card trick and mind reading illusion that keeps popping up online, most recently in the form of a PowerPoint presentation purporting to be the work of master stage magician David Copperfield (though it almost certainly is not).
  The illusion can be startling until you figure out how it works — at which point you may find yourself wondering how anyone could possibly fall for such a simple, obvious deception!
  I can read your mind! You don't believe me? Here, I'll prove it.
  Take a look at these six cards. Now pick one card — and only one — and remember it. Concentrate!
  Are you thinking of the card? Excellent.
  I will now, read your mind -- even though we're not in the same room and possibly not even on the same continent.
  Okay, I've got it. I know which card you chose. I will now make it disappear ...
  Voila! It's gone! Amazed? Don't be. Read on to learn how this simple trick is done.
  This is one of the simplest yet most effective mind reading illusions ever devised. How does it work? Take another look — a careful look — at the 'before' and 'after' card layouts, and it will become clear: Do you see it?
  The difference, aside from the fact that there's one fewer card in Figure 2, is that none of the cards in the second layout are the same as in the first. Not only did your chosen card disappear — they all disappeared and were replaced them with completely different but similar cards.
  Like most magic tricks, this one depends on misdirection which is a kind of deception — the audience is focused on one thing in or to distract attention from something else.
  There are two kinds of misdirection: the first method, which is time sensitive, encourages the audience to look away for a brief moment so that the magic trick or sleight of hand can be accomplished without detection.
  The second approach consists of reframing the audience's perception and has nothing to do with the senses. Here, the minds of the audience are distracted into thinking that focusing on an unimportant object is responsible for the resulting magic, when it really doesn't have any impact on the effect at all
  That's precisely the case with this trick — because you've been instructed to focus your attention and memory on one card and only one card, most of us fail to absorb any details about the other five. When the entire set is replaced by a different one that looks approximately the same, we accept it as exactly the same.
  Abracadabra!

"Mandatory Drug Sentencing Laws","http://crime.about.com/od/issues/i/drug_sentence.htm","2015-10-16 17:54:50","  In reaction to a virtual wave of cocaine being smuggled into the country and cocaine addiction reaching epidemic proportions in the 1980s, the U.S. Congress and many state legislatures adopted new laws that stiffened the penalties for anyone convicted of trafficking illegal drugs. These laws made jail terms mandatory for drug dealers and anyone in possession of certain amounts of illegal drugs.
  Mandatory drug sentencing for those found guilty of possession and sales of drugs is one that most Americans support.
  Voters have shown strong backing to political candidates who adopt the 'longer sentencing' position.
  Latest Developments
  More mandatory drug sentences are being proposed. Congressman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), a proponent of mandatory sentencing, has introduced a bill to Congress called 'Defending America's Most Vulnerable: Safe Access to Drug Treatment and Child Protection Act of 2004.' The bill is designed to increase mandatory sentences for specific drug offenses.
  It includes mandatory sentencing of 10 years to life in prison for any person age 21 or over who attempts or conspires to offer drugs (including marijuana) to someone younger than 18 years old. Anyone who has offered, solicited, enticed, persuaded, encouraged, induced, or coerces or possess a controlled substance, will be sentenced to a term not less than five years.
  Background
  Mandatory drug sentencing laws came about in the 1980s in the height of the War on Drugs. The seizure of 3,906 pounds of cocaine, valued then at over $100 million wholesale, from a Miami International Airport hangar on March 9, 1982 brought about the public's awareness of the Medellin Cartel -- Colombian drug traffickers working together -- and changed U.S. law enforcement's approach towards the drug trade -- and sparked new life into the War on Drugs.
  Lawmakers began to vote more money for law enforcement and began to create stiffer penalties for not only drug dealers, but for drug users.
  Pros
  Supporters of mandatory minimums view it as a way to deter drug distribution and use by extending the time that a criminal is incarcerated therefore preventing them from committing more drug-related crimes.
  One reason mandatory sentencing guidelines are established is to increase sentencing uniformity -- to guarantee that defendants, who commit similar crimes and have similar criminal backgrounds, receive similar sentences.
  Mandatory guidelines for sentencing greatly curtail judges' sentencing discretion.
  Without such mandatory sentencing, defendants in the past, guilty of virtually the same offenses under the same circumstances, have received vastly different sentences in the same jurisdiction, and in some cases from the same judge.
  Proponents argue that a lack of sentencing guidelines opens up the system to corruption.
  Cons
  Opponents to the mandatory sentencing feel that such punishment is unjust and does not allow for flexibility in the judicial process of prosecuting and sentencing individuals. Other critics of mandatory sentencing feel that the money spent in longer incarceration has not been beneficial in the war against drugs and could be better spent on other programs designed to fight drug abuse.
  A study performed by the Rand Company said such sentences have proven to be ineffective in curtailing drug use or drug related crime. 'The bottom line is that only decision makers who are very myopic would find long sentences to be appealing,' said study leader Jonathan Caulkins of Rand's Drug Policy Research Center.
  The high cost of incarceration and the small results that it has shown in fighting the war on drugs, show that such money would be better spent on shorter sentencing and drug rehabilitation programs.
  Other opponents to mandatory sentencing include Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in August 2003 in a speech to the American Bar Association, denounced minimum mandatory prison terms.
  'In too many cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise and unjust,' he said and encouraged the bar to be leaders in the search for justice in sentencing and in racial inequities.
  Dennis W. Archer, former Detroit mayor and Michigan Supreme Court Justice takes the position that 'it is time for America to stop getting tougher and start getting smarter against crime by reassessing mandatory sentencing and irrevocable prison terms.' In an article posted on the ABA website, he states, 'The idea that Congress can dictate a one-size-fits-all sentencing scheme does not make sense. Judges need to have the discretion to weigh the specifics of the cases before them and determine an appropriate sentence. There is a reason we give judges a gavel, not a rubber stamp'
  Where It Stands
  Because of cuts in many state budgets, and overcrowded prisons due to mandatory drug sentencing, lawmakers are facing a financial crisis. Many states have begun to use alternatives to imprisonment for drug offenders -- usually called 'drug courts' -- in which defendants are sentenced into treatment programs, rather than jail. In states where these drug courts have been established, officials are finding this approach to be a more effective way of approaching the drug problem.
  Research shows that drug court alternatives are not only more cost-effective than prison sentences for defendants who commit non-violent crimes, they help reduce the rate of defendants who return to a life of crime after completing the program.

  Kriner Kirby was at the hunting camp in Hornell NY the weekend of Jan 24, the weekend we had the big snowstorm. She has cats and noticed something had been cleaning out all the food on the deck and in the storage shed. Very Big Cat That sunday a rep from the DEC confirmed it was a Cougar. He said there is at least 10 cougars living between Hornell, Corning NY to Wellsboro PA. Each animal can roam a 100sq mile area and usually stay clear of human activity, but in the winter easy food will attract them. He noted this is VERY rare to have one at your door and stay there for 3 photos. This animal may be a problem one, he said. He also estimated the animal is over 100lbs. Also the local radio and tv news didn't seem to care much about this story or the photos. I guess they don't want to cause a scare in that area. Watch your back if you have a camp or cottage in that area.

The pictures were taken from his kitchen onto his patio deck. The critter was watching his little kids playing on the kitchen floor! Watonga is about 25 miles north of I 44 between OK City and Weatherford.
  AS IS evidenced by the many versions of the text accompanying these viral images, each one of them specifying a different location where the big cat depicted in the photos was supposedly sighted, some folks aren't content to merely pass the photos along — they want to scare the pants off their neighbors in the process.
  The pictures themselves are authentic. EXIF data embedded in all four images reveals they were shot with a Nikon digital camera on March 10, 2004 (there has been some confusion about the dating of the images, with most sources erroneously claiming they were taken in 2001 or 2002, and at least one other claiming they were taken in 2005).
  According to a 2007 article in Wild Cat News by the late Dave Hamilton, wildlife biologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation, the photos were snapped by Dr. Dave Rodgers of Lander, Wyoming, an area where cougar sightings are not infrequent.
  'Other than the small remnant population in southern Florida, cougars have been absent east of the Rockies for nearly a century,' Hamilton noted. The limited scientific evidence available suggests there could be a gradual resurgence of cougar populations occurring in some midwestern and eastern states, though biologists insist that will take several more years to confirm.
  Meanwhile, ordinary folks from Iowa to Maine keep swearing they've spotted full-grown mountain lions where they're not supposed to exist, egged on by 'a hungry news media' that 'too often reports unsubstantiated claims as factual,' Hamilton wrote. Most such reports involve misidentification of an animal — mistaking bobcats for cougars, for example — or are out-and-out hoaxes perpetrated via the Internet.
  Time will tell how many of them are true.
  Related: On April 14, 2008 a 150-pound cougar was shot and killed by police in the North Side Chicago neighborhood of Roscoe Village.

  As the story goes, an impatient golfer plays ahead of the rest of his party and disappears. His pals search for him, but all they can find is his golf clubs still sitting near the seventh hole. Three days later, a well-fed crocodile is captured nearby. Naturally, 'Ole Mose' is an immediate suspect in the disappearance.

  FW: Read story first before opening picture.
  You must read this and see the picture at the end. It is just crazy.... This is a true story from Palm Beach, Florida (the proof is at the end, but read the story first).
  The first foursome of the day played together to the 5th hole where one impatient golfer went ahead of the group. The remaining three finished their round and headed for the nineteenth hole to meet their less-patient friend. However, he wasn't there...and was no where to be found. Since his car was still in the parking lot, the threesome waited two hours.
  Thinking the impatient golfer might still be somewhere out on the course, they notified the clubhouse and the search was on. Of course, the impatient golfer was not located, but his clubs were found on the hole. Three days later, Ole Mose was spotted on the seventh hole and was an immediate suspect.
  Ole Mose was an American crocodile that was an infrequent course visitor for over 20 years. Not too much concern was ever given Ole Mose, as he had always made a hasty retreat whenever he saw anyone coming. To make a long story even longer, after the course officials, SPCA, lawyers, citizens groups, the mayor, Palm Beach PD, and the American Crocodile Association of Southern Florida agreed, it was decided that, in order to put everyone's mind at ease, Ole Mose should be unzipped.
  Take notice to what the man standing over Ole Moses is holding.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: Zoologist and crocodile expert Adam 'He Oughta Know' Britton tells us the email tale is fake but the photo is real. According to Britton, the incident captured on film couldn't have happened in Florida.
  How does he know? Simple. The particular species of crocodile in the image, Crocodylus porosus , is native to Indonesia. It's not found in Florida. Plus, says Britton, there has never been a crocodile-caused fatality in Florida (though alligator attacks are a different story ).
  The photograph was taken in Kalimantan (Borneo) in 1997. Nothing else is known about it. The email story was attached anonymously in July 1998 and the two have circulated together ever since.
  For a clue as to how such a tasteless joke might have come about, look no further than the fact that alligators are not only plentiful in Florida, but are frequently sighted on golf courses. Tourists have even been bitten on occasion. Our email author was evidently aware of this, but made the mistake of confusing alligators with their cousins, the crocodiles — of which there are only a few hundred left in Florida and none at all north of the Everglades.
  Even so, the story rings true for enough many readers that a West Palm Beach hotel and golf course called the Breakers, whose name is mentioned in one popular version of the email, complains of receiving a steady stream of credulous phone calls from the day the story first appeared. 'I compare this prank to tabloid journalism,' a spokesperson for the resort complained to reporters. 'When you're at the top of the heap, someone wants to knock you down.'
  The reputation of the endangered American crocodile hasn't exactly benefited from the hoax, either.

  FW: Piper's Frog in Kroger peas
  For those of you that haven't already heard from me personally here is a little story about Kroger (Dillons) brand canned peas. Trust me, it is NO JOKE.
  On 3-12 I heated up a can of Kroger peas in the microwave that I had purchased from Dillons at Central and Maize. After eating about half the bowl I noticed something a little darker mixed in with my peas. After one more spoonful of peas IT APPEARED. A FROG!!! After doing a double-triple take I spit my peas out all over the counter and ran to the kitchen sink and lost it. Grossed out beyond belief I poured a big glass of wine and chugged it. Apparently wine and frog laced peas don't go well together because I went back to the sink and lost it again.
  I called Kroger and they gave me the standard were sorry story and blamed their supplier, Lakeside Foods. They had me Fed Ex the frog to Lakeside foods for frog analysis or something.
  HERE IS THE INTERESTING PART. To my amazement/ horror the Kroger representative said I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THIS WAS HAPPENING TO. Yes, there could me more Kroger frogs out there!
  After a about a week they determine that there was indeed a frog in my peas. When I asked how they were going to resolve the situation they offered me a $100 Kroger gift card. I was pretty offended. I haven't been able to eat any vegetable since that day let alone look at a can of peas.
  So this doesn't happen to anyone else I am attaching the pictures of my little friend and the can he came in. Lakeside Foods also supplies canned vegetables to the Fleming Company. Fleming supplies the Wichita Checkers and Boogarts stores. Anyone want the 10 other cans of Kroger vegetables I still have in my cabinet?
  Pea sickened for life,
  Bryan Piper
  Analysis: 'It did happen,' a Kroger representative told me when I recited Bryan Piper's horror story to him over the customer service hotline. 'These things can happen, but it's not a very common occurrence. We take the strictest precautions to prevent it.'
  In this case, he explained, the wayward frog evidently rolled itself into a tiny ball the size and shape of a pea, thus escaping detection during the automated sorting process.
  Come to find out, this is a fairly well-known phenomenon in the vegetable packing industry.
  He wasn't able to confirm or deny Piper's account of how the company handled his complaint, though according to news coverage by KAKE-TV in Wichita, Piper received a letter of apology from Kroger even though an independent cannery was actually to blame. A spokesman for the cannery confirmed the slip-up and admitted it was not an isolated incident, though oversights of this kind are generally rare, he said. The company claims it has spent millions of dollars on equipment expressly designed to prevent such occurrences.
  We're accustomed, of course, to finding out upon investigation that dreadful contamination stories of this ilk are false or, at best, impossible to confirm (e.g., ' The McPus Sandwich ,' ' McChickenhead ,' ' Cockroach Egg Tacos ,' ' Kentucky Fried Rat ,' etc.), thus it's well to be reminded that such incidents really do occur. Every true report lends credence to a host of similar-sounding urban legends, which helps explain why these larger-than-life tales remain popular, indeed comprising their own unique genre of contemporary folklore.
  It's not, as cynics might claim, because the general public is naive and gullible, but because the stories reflect, albeit in exaggerated form, people's genuine, valid concerns about their own safety and well-being as consumers of a mass-produced, depersonalized food supply.
  In recognition of this, it is often said that even the most outlandish urban legends contain at least a small grain of truth. Some, we are now compelled to add, contain an entire legume's worth.
  Look before you eat!

  Subject: Fw: Mermaid found in the Philippines
  CREEPY! I don't know if this is true... Found in Visayas Region... was caught by fishermen!!!
  Not to be pedantic, but mermaids — defined as half-human, half-fish denizens of the deep once believed to lure lovestruck sailors to their death — have been a staple of myth and legend for thousands of years. They don't exist.
  There's a related tradition of more recent origin, perhaps dating back 1,500 years, which consists of manufacturing fake mermaid carcasses for public display using the body parts of dead monkeys and fish.
  The photographs you have just seen document one such artifact.
  A similar specimen fabricated in Japan is believed to be 1,400 years old. Yet another, and by far the most famous, is P.T. Barnum's Feejee Mermaid , purchased secondhand by the great showman in the mid-1800s and exhibited throughout the United States as a sideshow attraction.
  The glaring irony in all this mermaid fakery, with respect to the ancient tales on which it is based, is that the mummified specimens one typically finds on display are, without exception, hideous in appearance — 'the incarnation of ugliness,' as one American critic described Barnum's creature — while the classic mermaid of folklore and pop culture is invariably represented as beautiful and alluring. It is a discrepancy no one ever bothers to explain.
  Update: These same images surfaced once again in early 2005 as part of a message claiming the mermaid carcass was washed up on a beach in Chennai, India by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004.

"Do You Need to Press the "Clear" Button After Paying at the Gas Pump?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/business/a/clear_button.htm","2016-05-29 20:53:13","  By David Emery
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: May 2008 Status: False
  Summary: Viral message advises service station customers to press the 'clear' button after using a debit or credit card at the gas pump so subsequent users won't be able to 'piggyback' charges on their accounts.

  Jim just told me about something that happened to one of his coworkers. She used her credit/debit card to purchase gas at the pump (like most of us do). She received her receipt like normal. However, when she checked her statement, there were 2 $50 charges added in addition to her purchase. Upon investigation, she found out that because she did not press the 'clear' button on the pump, the employee inside the store was able to use her card to purchase his/her own gas! To keep this from happening, after you get your receipt, you must press the 'CLEAR' button or your information will be stored until the next customer inserts their card.

  Officer Dave Gilman Crime Prevention Officer Colorado Springs Police Department Stetson Hills Division 719-444-3168
  Analysis: If this were true, you'd be hearing alerts about it on the evening news or in your daily newspaper, not finding out about it in an internet meme .
  What's more, these devices —' pay-at-the-pump card readers — get so much use that if credit card 'piggybacking' were really as easy as described above, gas station customers would be doing it, accidentally or not, all the time . And there would be a deafening public outcry about it, not a viral whimper.
  The card processing equipment on modern gas pumps works the same as that found at ATMs and grocery store check-out stands. Once the charge has gone through, the transaction is complete. Period. The next customer's purchase can't end up on your credit or debit card.
  Colorado Springs police officer Dave Gilman, whose signature line appears at the bottom of one variant of the message, admits sending the message but told KRDO-TV News that the information is incomplete. 'The first couple of lines were telling people that those pumps are very rare and hard to find,' he said. A company that manufactures the equipment explained that such a thing could have happened with 'first-generation models,' but few people nowadays could expect to encounter the outdated machines.
  The clear button exists for a reason, however. Waite Park, Minnesota community service officer Alicia Mages, says customers should make use of it if they swipe their cards then change their minds about pumping gas. 'In checking with a local station,” she told Newsleaders.com, 'they indicated your card information clears after you fill your vehicle. However, if you put your card in and decide to use a different pump, or leave the station, you do need to press clear or cancel to clear your information out of the pump.'

"Do They Eat Babies in China?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/eating_babies.htm","2016-04-09 16:42:43","  Dear Urban Legends:
  I received an email last week which was quite disturbing and, to say the least, disgusting. It is about dead babies that can be bought from hospitals in Taiwan for $70 to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies!
  I am sure this must be a hoax, although the message comes with an attached slide show, showing how the baby is prepared, cooked and eaten.
  Could you please investigate?
  Dear Reader:
  Given the nature of the 'evidence' — namely, tabloid-style rumor-mongering and unsourced images circulating on the Internet — we must proceed under the assumption that the Chinese as a people, whether on the mainland or in Taiwan, are no more inclined to eat human children than folks in other parts of the world.
  The same holds true for Jews, Christians, 'Gypsies,' witches, aborigines, Satanists, and all the other ethnic and religious groups accused of practicing this bloody 'custom' down through the centuries. There's simply no evidence that it exists, or has ever existed, anywhere on the planet. The burden of proof is on those who claim otherwise.
  The notion that killing and eating human babies or fetuses is an accepted practice within certain groups is essentially a modern version of an ancient form of bigotry known as ' blood libel ,' which consisted, historically, of one group accusing another of murdering infants in ritual sacrifices. The Greeks accused the Jews of doing it; the Romans accused the Christians of doing it; according to the Christians, it really was the Jews who did it — and so on, since time immemorial.
  Sociologists say the driving forces behind such ideas are ignorance, xenophobia (fear of 'the other') and psychological projection (attributing perceived moral failings of one's own group to others). As an example of the latter, it has been speculated that the spread of horror stories in the West about the supposed use of unborn babies as food in Asia may be fueled by qualms about social practices closer to home — practices such as abortion, for example, and the so-called 'cannibalization' of fetal tissue for scientific research.
  In any case, it's difficult to tell — and under dispute — whether photographs circulating online since December 2000 which appear to show an Asian man cooking and eating a human fetus are real or fake. We do know, thanks to documentation provided on Chinese-Art.com, that they were the work of a conceptual artist named Zhu Yu. The photos were exhibited at an underground art show after being rejected as 'too controversial' by curators of the Shanghai 2000 Bienniale. For those who haven't seen them and aren't too squeamish to take a peek, here are two examples from Zhu's postmodern performance piece, aptly titled 'Eating People,' collected from forwarded emails:
  The artist himself, whose past accomplishments include an opus called 'Canned Human Brains,' has claimed in interviews that he used real aborted fetuses stolen from a medical school to create the piece, and that he actually cooked and ate the fetuses 'for art's sake.'
  Should we take him at his word? Not necessarily.
  It is true — to the point of being a cliche, in fact — that avant-garde artists will say and do anything to shock their audiences, so we're obliged to acknowledge the possibility that Zhu Yu is telling the truth — that he really did cook and eat human fetuses in front of a camera.
  On the other hand, they don't call the kind of work Zhu does performance art for nothing, and it has been argued that he may have constructed his 'fetuses' out of doll parts and animal carcasses, pretended to consume them in front of a camera and issued tongue-in-cheek statements to the press claiming he was actually eating human flesh.
  That's a theory I'm inclined to support, because, frankly, if Zhu's claims were factual he'd probably be serving jail time right now. There's no reason to suppose the government of China is any more tolerant of cannibalism than governments anywhere else. The fact that Zhu's work was rejected for inclusion in an state-run exhibition bears that out.
  By his own 'admission,' the fetuses Zhu allegedly cooked and ate were obtained illegally, thus, if he is telling the truth, he could be prosecuted as an accomplice in that crime, as well.
  In early 2001, a Malaysian tabloid published several of Zhu's photos in conjunction with a story alleging that the signature dish of a particular Taiwanese restaurant contains the 'meat' of human infants. Taiwan government officials immediately demanded a retraction — a de facto confirmation that baby eating is not particularly well-accepted by the Chinese.
  Shortly afterward, the same pictures turned up on a prominent website specializing in tasteless content (www.rotten.com), prompting reports in the British press that Scotland Yard and the FBI were investigating their origins.
  The owner of said website maintains he has never been contacted by authorities from any country, however. As of August 2001, the photos were still on display there.

"A Case of Eye Worm","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/fl/A-Case-of-Eye-Worm.htm","2016-01-13 13:57:16","  By David Emery
  A collection of images circulating on the Internet purports to show the surgical removal of a live worm or insect larva from a patient's eye. The patient had come to the doctor's office complaining of swelling and irritation due to dust exposure.
  Forwarded text:
  Fw: Careful with dust!!!
  Its just like from an alien movie be very careful when u get caught with dust.... as following pics will show effects of bad dust to a person.
  While he was walking he felt an eye irritation, thinking that it was just regular dust, he started to rub his eye, in an effort to remove the dust.... then his eyes got really red, and he went and bought some eye drops from a pharmacy.... few days passed n his eyes were still red and seems a little swollen.
  Again he dismissed it as the constant rubbing and that it will go away. The days go by the swelling of his eye got worse, redder and bigger.... till he decided to go and see a doctor for a check up.
  The doctor immediately wanted an operation, being afraid of a tumor growth or cyst. At the operation, what was thought to be a growth or cyst, actually turned out to be a live worm..... what was thought initially to be just mere dust actually was an insect's egg...... because of that, my friends, if u do get caught in dust, and the pain persists, pls go see a doctor immediately...... thank you.... (see the pics)

  Description: Viral images and text Circulating since: Nov. 2002 Status: Images are authentic; the story not so much
  Analysis: Bizarre as it may seem, the photos above are authentic, though the same cannot be said of the accompanying text, which is an utter fabrication.
  There's no way to determine who assembled the collage, which has circulated anonymously since 2002, but I did manage to locate the source of the individual images, an article entitled 'Anterior Orbital Myiasis Caused by Human Botfly,' published in the July 2000 edition of the Archives of Ophthalmology , a journal of the American Medical Association.
  Myiasis is the medical term for a maggot (fly larva) infestation of a living body. In this case, the patient was a 5-year-old boy treated by U.S. Air Force surgeons in a rural area of the Republic of Honduras. 'The respiratory pore of a late-stage larva of the human botfly ( Dermatobia hominis ) was located in the anterior orbit,' says the article abstract. 'The larva was gently removed under general anesthesia through a small incision in the conjunctiva.'
  That is to say, the patient had a worm in his eye. Doctors put him under and removed it through a small incision on the surface of his eyeball. Apparently, the patient was none the worse for wear in the aftermath.
  It would appear that the journal article itself was not consulted at all when the email tale above was composed. Neither 'bad dust' nor excessive eye rubbing are cited by the authors as causes of the larva infestation in the 5-year-old patient. It resulted from contact with insects.
  According to entomologists, the human botfly lays its eggs on the bodies of other insects (such as mosquitoes), which then transfer the eggs to animal or human hosts by direct contact. When a botfly egg hatches, the larva burrows into the host's skin (or, in this case, eye) head-first and begins feeding.
  This nasty creature is found mainly in Central and South America, but there are other species of flies known to responsible for cases of myiasis in North America, mainly blowflies. According to an epidemiological study conducted in 2000, most instances of myiasis acquired in the U.S. resulted from blowflies laying their eggs in pre-existing wounds.
  None of which is quite as terrifying as the claim that any one of us could end up with an eye worm simply by being exposed to too much dust — which helps explain why the true facts of the case aren't circulating with the photos. In folklore, the story's the thing. Accuracy takes a back seat to the emotional impact of the narrative; or, as folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand succinctly puts it, 'The truth never stands in the way of a good story.'

  Analysis: A very large dog indeed. It's a mastiff of some kind, probably a Boerboel . These dogs can weigh as much as 180 pounds in adulthood.
  I have not been able to determine the origin of the image, which has been circulating online since 2006. The software I use to detect editing tells me the photo has been manipulated, but that could just mean it was cropped or color-adjusted. There are no obvious signs of tinkering, however the dog's size, particularly that of its head, is exaggerated somewhat by perspective. Other photos show mastiffs of similarly impressive size relative to their owners.
  An optical illusion may trick some observers into thinking the dog is even bigger than it is. The low stone wall that curves around from the dog's left and all the way up to the blue fence behind the subjects is partly in shadow, and at first glance that shadow may appear to be part of the dog's body, but it isn't (note the dimly visible stones in the shadow).

"Did Nostradamus Predict the 9/11 Attacks?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/nostradamus.htm","2017-01-05 13:30:50","  By David Emery
  Did 16th-century astrologer Nostradamus predict the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon? In every major catastrophe, there are claims that he foretold it, and this is no exception. The he-told-you-so messages began circulating online hours after the terrorist attack.
  Nostradamus, the most famous astrologer who ever lived, was born in France in 1503 and published his barely scrutable collection of prophecies, 'The Centuries,' in 1555. Each four-line verse (or 'quatrain') purported to foretell world events far into the future, and ever since Nostradamus' time devotees have claimed his work accurately predicted wars, natural disasters and the rise and fall of empires.
  It's plain to see that Nostradamus couched his 'prophetic' verses in language so obscure that the words can be, and have been, interpreted to mean almost anything. What's more, the interpreting is always done after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight, and with the concerted aim of proving the relevance of a given passage to an actual event.
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  'Spooky' quatrains allegedly foretelling the events of 9/11 with incredible specificity were circulating online within hours of the first jetliner crash in New York City — completely bogus quatrains, as it turned out. It wasn't a question of whether or not they accurately predicted anything; Nostradamus simply didn't write them.
  The first quatrain to hit email inboxes on 9/11 contained the prediction that a 'great thunder' would be heard in the 'City of God':
  'In the City of God there will be a great thunder, Two brothers torn apart by Chaos, while the fortress endures, the great leader will succumb', The third big war will begin when the big city is burning'
  - Nostradamus 1654
  Let the interpreting begin! Assuming 'the City of God' is New York City, then the 'two brothers torn apart by Chaos' must be the fallen towers of the Word Trade Center. The 'fortress' is clearly the Pentagon, the 'great leader' succumbing to Chaos must be the United States of America, and 'the third big war' can only mean World War III.
  Spooky, right? Not so fast.
  Let's go back and apply a little intellectual honesty. What earthly (or unearthly) justification could Nostradamus have had for describing New York City (which did not yet even exist) as 'the City of God?' Why did the Great Seer feel compelled to refer to the future World Trade Center towers as 'two brothers' instead of using a more apt word like 'buildings' or 'monuments' (or even 'towers')?
  Granted, the word 'fortress' isn't an unreasonable descriptor for the Pentagon. But by what stretch of the imagination would it have been accurate to stipulate that 'the great leader' (is that really the phrase M. Nostradamus would have used to describe the future US?) would 'succumb' to the destruction of two buildings?
  Quibbling over individual words is futile, given that Nostradamus didn't even write this passage . Michel de Nostredame died in 1566, nearly a hundred years before the date given in the email (1654). The quatrain is nowhere to be found in his entire published oeuvre. In a word, it's a hoax.
  More precisely, its attribution to Nostradamus is a hoax. The passage was lifted from a web page (long since deleted from the server that originally hosted it) containing an essay written by college student Neil Marshall in 1996 entitled ' Nostradamus: A Critical Analysis .' In the essay itself, Marshall admits inventing the quatrain for the purpose of demonstrating — quite ironically, in light of the way it was subsequently misused — how a Nostradamus-like verse can be so cryptically couched as to lend itself to whatever interpretation one wishes to make.
  Interestingly, a variant of this faux prophecy turned up in the soc.culture.palestine newsgroup only one day after 9/11 under the heading 'They followed his prediction.' It went like this:
  'The third big war will begin when the big city is burning'
  - Nostradamus 1654
  ...on the 11 day of the 9 month that... two metal birds would crash into two tall statues... in the new city... and the world will end soon after'
  'From the book of Nostradamus'
  Here again, even though the text boasts all the pomp and musty vagueness one finds in Nostradamus' actual writings, it does not exist, in whole or in part, anywhere in The Centuries . This, too, is an internet hoax, a cheeky elaboration on Neil Marshall's invented quatrain.
  Our third example is 'spookier' yet:
  Century 6, Quatrain 97
  Two steel birds will fall from the sky on the Metropolis. The sky will burn at forty-five degrees latitude. Fire approaches the great new city (New York City lies between 40-45 degrees)
  Immediately a huge, scattered flame leaps up. Within months, rivers will flow with blood. The undead will roam earth for little time.
  This passage, it turns out, is not entirely fake. Rather, it is what you might call an 'imaginative revision' of an actual verse from The Centuries . The authentic passage on which it is based is usually translated from the French as follows:
  As you can see, Nostradamus made no mention of 'two steel birds' in the original passage, nor did he predict that 'the undead will roam the earth.' As to the geographical location of New York City, it is found at exactly 40 degrees, 42 minutes, 51 seconds north latitude. So, while it isn't false to say that it lies 'between 40-45 degrees,' it is imprecise, not to mention an obvious, disingenuous ploy to make what Nostradamus actually wrote ('The sky will burn at forty-five degrees latitude') seem germane to the events of September 11, 2001.
  Specimen #4, also circulating via email, is merely an elaboration of the above:
  'In the year of the new century and nine months, From the sky will come a great King of Terror... The sky will burn at forty-five degrees. Fire approaches the great new city...'
  'In the city of york there will be a great collapse, 2 twin brothers torn apart by chaos while the fortress falls the great leader will succumb third big war will begin when the big city is burning'
  - NOSTRADAMUS
  He said this will be bigger than the previous two. 2001 is the first year of the new century and this is the 9th month. New York is located at the 41st degree Latitude.
  Once again,  it contains very few words actually written by Nostradamus. Individual lines drawn from two disparate quatrains have been taken out of context, rearranged, and supplemented with made-up lines by a person(s) unknown to make them seem pertinent to the event. The result, as before, is pure bunk. Not even Nostradamus would want to take credit for this 'prediction.'

"When the United Arab Emirates Won Independence From Britain","http://middleeast.about.com/od/unitedarabemirates/a/me081203.htm","2016-10-09 20:39:01","  By Pierre Tristam
  Before its re-creation as the United Arab Emirates in 1971, the UAE was known as the Trucial States, a collection of sheikhdoms extending from the Straits of Hormuz to the west along the Persian Gulf. It wasn’t a country so much as an expanse of loosely defined sheikhdoms spreading over some 32,000 square miles (83,000 sq. km), about the size of the state of Maine.
  For centuries the region was mired in rivalries between local emirs on land while pirates scoured the seas and used the states’ shores as their refuge. Britain began attacking pirates to protect its trade with India. That led to British ties with the Trucial States’ emirs. The ties were formalized in 1820 as Britain offered protection in exchange for exclusivity: the emirs, accepting a truce brokered by Britain, pledged not to cede any land to nay powers or make any treaties with anyone except Britain. They also agreed to settle subsequent disputes through British authorities.
  The subservient relationship was to last a century and a half, until 1971.
  By then, Britain’s imperial overreach was exhausted politically and bankrupt financially. Britain decided in 1971 to abandon Bahrain , Qatar and the Trucial States, by then made up of seven emirates. Britain’s original aim was to combine all nine entities into a united federation.
  Bahrain and Qatar balked, preferring independence on their own. With one exception, the Emirates agreed to the joint venture, risky as it seemed: the Arab world had, until then, never known a successful federation of disparate pieces, let alone bicker-prone emirs with egos enough to enrich the sandy landscape.
  The six emirates that agreed to join in the federation were Abu Dhabi, Dubai , Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Sharjah, and Quwayn. On Dec. 2, 1971, the six emirates declared their independence from Britain and called themselves the United Arab Emirates. (Ras al Khaymah initially opted out, but eventually joined the federation in February 1972).
  Sheikh Zaid ben Sultan, Emir of Abu Dhabi, the richest of the seven emirates, was the union’s first president, followed by Sheikh Rashid ben Saeed of Dubai, the second-richest emirate. Abu Dhabi and Dubai have oil reserves. The remaining emirates do not. The union signed a treaty of friendship with Britain and declared itself part of the Arab Nation. It was by no means democratic, and rivalries among the emirates didn’t cease. The union was ruled by a 15-member council, subsequently reduced to seven—one seat for each of the unelected emirs. Half the 40-seat legislative Federal National Council is appointed by the seven emirs; 20 members are elected to 2-year terms by 6,689 Emiratis, including 1,189 women, who are all appointed by seven emirs. There are no free elections or political parties in the Emirates.
  Two days before the emirates declared their independence, Iranian troops landed on Abu Musa Island in the Persian Gulf and the two Tunb islands that dominate the Straits of Hormuz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Those islands belonged to Rais el Khaima Emirate.
  The Shah of Iran contended that Britain had wrongfully granted the islands to the emirates 150 years before. He was retaking them, he alleged, to look after oil tankers traveling through the Straits. The Shah’s reasoning was more expedience than logic: the emirates had no way to endanger oil shipments, though Iran very much did.
  The Iranian troop landing, however, was arranged with Sheikh Khaled al Kassemu of the Sharja Emirate in exchange for $3.6 million over nine years and Iran’s pledge that if oil were discovered on the Island, Iran and Sharja would split the proceeds. The arrangement cost Sharja's ruler his life: Shaikh Khalid ibn Muhammad was gunned down in a coup attempt.
  Britain itself was complicit in the occupation as it explicitly agreed to let Iranian troops take over the Island one day before independence.
  By timing the occupation on Britain’s watch, Britain was hoping to relieve the emirates of the burden of an international crisis. But the dispute over the islands hung over relations between Iran and the Emirates for decades. Iran still controls the islands.

"Elephants: What Do They Eat, Where Do They Live and What Makes Them Special?","http://ecology.about.com/od/Ecology/fl/Elephants-What-Do-They-Eat-Where-Do-They-Live-and-What-Makes-Them-Special.htm","2016-01-24 19:12:22","  By Jenn Savedge
  Elephants once roamed over large swaths of Africa and Asia. But they were almost wiped completely off of the map by the aggressive ivory trade of the early 20th century. Fortunately, international regulations were put in place at the latter part of that century to protect these gentle giants, and there populations - while still diminished - are finally beginning to recover.
  Elephants are massive mammals. They can reach a height of 13 feet and a weight of 15,000 pounds. In general, there are two recognized subspecies of elephants - the African elephant and the Asian elephant, with the greatest difference between the two being their physical location. African elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan Africa while Asian elephants are found in southern and southeastern Asia.
  These massive creatures are known for their thick bodies, stocky legs, giant floppy ears, trunks, and tusks. Those big ears help elephants stay cool in hot, dry conditions.
  continue reading below our video
  10 Best Universities in the United States
  And their trunks serve as a fifth limb which they use to breathe, grasp objects, lift water, and even suckle for comfort .
  Another big difference between Asian and African elephants is their tusks. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, unlike Asian elephants in which only the males have tusks - and not even all males. It is the elephant's tusks -made of ivory- that are so valuable to poachers.
  Asian elephants are also smaller than their African peers, and their ears have straight edges at the bottoms unlike the fan-like shape of African elephant ears. Another key difference? Asian elephants have four toes on their hind feet and five on the forefeet, while African elephants have three on their hind feet and five on the forefeet.
  Elephants are herbivores that live in many different types of habitat from savannah to marsh to forest. They are considered keystone species due to their impact on the environment in which they live. They are very social animals that live together in large groups , usually comprised of several female elephants - called cows - and their babies - or calves. Often these groups are made up from females and baby elephants from several different families. These elephants are led by a matriarch - typically the oldest female in the group. Male elephants - called bulls - usually leave the group once they reach puberty and may live alone or with other bulls.
  Elephants have the longest known pregnancy of any living mammal . Elephant mothers carry their babies for 22 months in the womb and then care for their babies for several years after birth.
  One topic that has been the subject of lots of research regarding elephants is their methods of communication. Elephants have been known to communicate via touch, sight, smell, and sound. Over long distances, they can use seismic communication - or vibrations made by stomping their feet - to communicate dangers to other members of the herd.
  Elephants are prey animals that are hunted by top predators such as lions, tigers, and hyenas. But usually, these animals only go after the very young or the very old. The elephant's greatest threat is humankind. Both African and Asian elephants were hunted nearly to extinction before a ban on ivory trade was enacted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1989. Asian elephants are still classified as endangered , while African elephants are considered vulnerable.
  Habitat loss is another threat that faces the existence of elephants. Human-elephant conflicts have increased over the years as humans have encroached more and more upon elephant habitat and migratory routes.

On close examination it's clearly a painting  an illustration or a work of art  not a photograph. It's unlikely that the 'awesome,' 'unbelievable' rock formation depicted in the artwork actually exists. If it does, its anthropomorphic features were imaginatively enhanced by the artist.
  In addition to circulating via email, the image has been posted numerous times on Internet message boards without attribution. Several readers have written to suggest that the painting may be the work of artist Bev Doolittle, though this remains unconfirmed.

  THAT FASHION models tend to be underweight and overly thin compared to the general populace and subject to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are criticisms frequently leveled at the fashion industry, and with good reason. At issue is not only the health and well-being of the models themselves, but that of ordinary women and girls constantly confronted with this impossible standard of beauty in the mainstream media.
  While the foregoing images hammer home that important point, they do so deceptively, however. Each photo has been digitally altered to exaggerate the models' emaciated appearance (for comparison, the original versions of several of the photos are available for viewing on Snopes.com). We don't know who manipulated the images (which have been circulating online since 2003), or for what purpose, but they're probably best interpreted as satire.
  The powers that be in the fashion industry have begun to get the point. In February 2011, the Council of Fashion Designers of America issued a statement pledging its commitment to 'healthier standards' for models.
  'Although models are key to effecting change, they obviously cannot do it alone,' wrote CFDA president Diane Von Furstenberg. 'Everyone in the fashion industry  designers, casting directors, agents, fashion-magazine editors, show producers  need to join forces. The bottom line is the importance of healthy, fit models whose well-being can in turn promote the development of positive body image and improved self-esteem in all girls and women.'

  According to the owner of the space, Schubert & Hoey Outdoor Advertising of Minneapolis, the sign was put up by local business owners who wish to remain anonymous.

  Many people said it is a rumor and the picture is the result of the blessings of latest technology. However, the photo itself is very scary and I'm sure you'll also feel the same way I've felt. Here you go with the photo!!!
  A navy officer sent this letter to 13 people and he was promoted..
  A business man received this letter and threw it away..not believing in it.. and he lost everything he had within 13 days..
  It reached a labourer and he distributed it to 13 people.. he was promoted and all his problems were solved within 13 days..
  So you must send this e mail to 13 people for something good to happen to you so people..get sending !! :) don't be lazy..
  P/S : Do not send back to the person who send this to you!!!

  READ BEFORE OPENING THE PHOTO... The young man in this photo visited a historic site in Georgia called Fort 
 Mountain 
 with his friends and he asked them to take his photo while hiking. While 
 his friend took the photo, he screamed and fainted. Then 2 days later he 
>died 
 in the hospital. The doctors said he died from a heart attack. When the photos where developed, in the last photo there was a woman 
 standing next to the young man, even though his friends said there was 
 no one with him when the photo was taken. Many people know of this rumor 
 and the last photo is the result of the blessings of technology. People 
 say its the ghost of Cherokee Chief Ross's wife Madam Firecrochet. Still, the photo is very mysterious and I am sure that when you see it 
 you will feel the same as me. Here is the photo! A Naval Officer sent it 
 to 13 people and he was promoted within 13 days. A businessperson was sent this, he erased it, and with in 13 days he 
 lost everything. A laborer received this and sent it to 13 people and within days he was 
 promoted and all his problems were solved. So send this to 13 people and 
 good things will come your way.

"Carmen Winstead","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/ghoststories/a/carmen_winstead.htm","2016-02-15 21:13:57","  By David Emery
  In which we investigate the story of a 17-year-old girl allegedly pushed down a sewer and killed by a gang of bullies from her school. Her ghost has returned to wreak revenge on those who do not share it. Can any of this possibly be true?
  Description: Chain letter Circulating since: 2006 See also: French version | Spanish version Status: False
  Example #1 : Text of MySpace.com post contributed by a reader, October 6, 2006:
  ------ Bulletin Message ------
  They pushed her down a sewer
  About 6 years ago in Indiana, Carmen Winstead was pushed down a sewer opening by 5 girls in her school, trying to embarrass her in front of her school during a fire drill. When she didn't submerge the police were called. They went down and brought up 17 year old Carmen Winstead's body, her neck broke hitting the ladder, then side concrete at the bottom. The girls told everyone she fell... They believed them.
  FACT: 2 months ago, 16 year old David Gregory read this post and didn't repost it. When he went to take a shower he heard laughter from his shower, he started freaking out and ran to his computer to repost it, He said goodnight to his mom and went to sleep, 5 hours later his mom woke up in the middle of the night cause of a loud noise, David was gone, that morning a few hours later the police found him in the sewer, his neck broke and his face skin peeled off.
  If you don't repost this saying 'She was pushed' or 'They pushed her down a sewer' Then Carmen will get you, either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.

  Example #2: As shared via Google+, Oct. 4, 2014:
  'Hi my name is Carmen Winstead. I'm 17 years old. I am very similar to you... Did I mention to you that I'm dead. A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me. When I didn't come back up the police came. The girls said that I had fell and everyone believed them. The police found my body in the sewer. I had a broken neck and my face was torn off. Send this message to 15 people after you read the whole message if you value your life! A boy called David received this message. He just laughed and deleted it. When he was in the shower he heard laughing... MY LAUGHTER! He got really scared, rushed to his phone to repost this message... But he was too late. The next morning his mum entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying, 'You will never have him back!' No one has found his body yet... because he is with me! A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people (10 more than required). I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger. Send this to 15 people in the next 5 minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's. Your time starts... NOW! The story is true you can research It on google'
  Analysis: Don't panic. I could find no public record of a teenage girl named Carmen Winstead who perished after being pushed down a sewer drain by bullying schoolmates — not in North America, at any rate, and certainly not within the past 50 years.
  That doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that no such thing ever happened, but it's reason enough to classify the tale as folklore , a cautionary tale , an urban legend .
  It's also a classic example of a chain letter , albeit one circulating in the form of shared Facebook posts and forwarded emails instead of snail mail, which is how chain letters were traditionally distributed before the advent of digital media. Like every chain letter since time immemorial, however, its primary goal is self-replication. The story is told in such a way as to persuade you to pass it along to your friends, so they'll pass it along to their friends, and so on, ensuring that the text continues to circulate.
  This particular chain letter relies on a supernatural threat — the promise of a painful death at the hands of Carmen Winstead's ghost — to goad recipients into passing it along. 'If you don't repost this saying 'They pushed her,'' the text warns, 'then Carmen will get you, either from the sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.'
  Are you scared yet? If so, you probably shouldn't read any of these other specimens of the ghost-story-chain-letter genre, because they're likely to frighten you even more...

  Caption example: As shared on Facebook, Feb. 22, 2013:
  Analysis: The caption is erroneous, or an outright hoax. While it's true that actress Frances Bavier played the role of the matronly Aunt Bee on The Andy Griffith Show between 1960 and 1968 and on its spin-off, Mayberry R.F.D. , through 1970, whoever is trying to convince us that she posed for the forties-era pin-up photo above is pulling our collective leg.
  In truth, there's no resemblance between the two women pictured in the photos.
  The pic on the left is actually a publicity still from the 1949 film Yes Sir, That's My Baby starring Donald O'Connor with, pictured in a bathing suit, the beautiful Gloria DeHaven . DeHaven, born in 1925, was 24 years old when the photo was taken. Frances Bavier, born in 1902, would have been 47. She retired from acting at the age of 69 in 1972, and died in 1989.

  Example: Email contributed by D. Sefton, April 12, 2001:
  Subject: You have to see this......
  Even if you are not a cat 'person' you have to LOOK at the picture!!!!!
  Rodger Degagne a former employee with AECL in Chalk River may be embarking on a new career as Feline Breeder. Relaxing in his spacious home on the shores of the Ottawa River, Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs abandoned since the late 50's. With the help of his tuna sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could pick them up.
  A self described animal lover he did not want to place the kittens in the local Human Society. In this largely rural area, cats of all stripes and age largely go unwanted and are humanely disposed of after a few days. Later that evening, his wife Louise and their two children, Nicole and Kelly came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found. Lost turned out to be female and Found a male. When nature finally took its course a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with a unique black markings on her side and tail. Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's.
  While Lost and Found are no longer with us, their progeny live on. In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball. Put simply Snowball is no ordinary cat, she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs. She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing. She always meowed for more food, and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover. 'Chicken is her favorite, once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone.' Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her. She just isn't afraid of any animals. After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard we couldn't Keep raccoons from Snowball. 'At least it kept the food bills down!' Rodger laughed. 'Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten' he said. So what does a 87 pound cat eat? 'Snowball goes through a about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken , supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall. She likes Pike a lot, so I don't throw them back any more'.
  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight. So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowballs size to? Rodger says 'Well the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have'.

  Dog For Sale: OR free to good home.
  Answers to the name of Dolly. Excellent guard dog.
  Owner cannot afford to feed him anymore, as there are no more thieves, murderers, rapists or molesters left in the neighborhood for him to eat.
  Most of them knew him as 'holy sh*t!!'
  Your help will be appreciated.
  Analysis: A very large dog indeed. It's a mastiff of some kind, probably a Boerboel . These dogs can weigh as much as 180 pounds in adulthood.
  I have not been able to determine the origin of the image, which has been circulating online since 2006. The software I use to detect editing tells me the photo has been manipulated, but that could just mean it was cropped or color-adjusted. There are no obvious signs of tinkering, however the dog's size, particularly that of its head, is exaggerated somewhat by perspective. Other photos show mastiffs of similarly impressive size relative to their owners.
  An optical illusion may trick some observers into thinking the dog is even bigger than it is. The low stone wall that curves around from the dog's left and all the way up to the blue fence behind the subjects is partly in shadow, and at first glance that shadow may appear to be part of the dog's body, but it isn't (note the dimly visible stones in the shadow).

"Giant Coconut Crab","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fish/ss/coconut_crab.htm","2016-08-23 06:44:31","  Description: Viral images Circulating since: 2007 Status: Authentic (details on next page)
  Example: Email text contributed by Dallas B., Feb. 6, 2009:
  Analysis: Of the preceding pair of images, the one above has been authenticated (it appears in the photostream of a Flickr user named 'BlueBec') but the other , while presumably just as authentic, has yet to be sourced. The EXIF data embedded in the first image indicates the photo was taken on April 4, 2007 with an Olympus digital camera and that it was not subsequently edited. In short, these scary-looking beasts are real.
  Coconut crabs (also known as 'robber crabs,' and by the scientific name Birgus latro) are related to hermit crabs and typically grow to about 16 inches in length, pincer to pincer, though there have been anecdotal reports of specimens double that size. In any case, it is the world's largest species of land crab and reputedly lives as long as 50 years. An inhabitant of islands throughout the Indian and central Pacific oceans, the coconut crab tends to stick close to beaches, though it can't live in water (in fact, it will drown if submerged for too long a period of time). True to both of its common names, the omnivorous crustacean's preferred food source is the white flesh of fallen coconuts, though it will fall back on whatever sustenance is at hand, including such delicacies as might be scavenged from a garbage can (as in the first image).
  Reportedly , coconut crabs have even been known to feast on small animals (chickens, kittens, their fellow crabs, etc.), and a theory has even been floated that the body of lost-at-sea pilot Amelia Earhart was consumed by coconut crabs, and that's why her remains have never been found.
  Unfortunately for them, coconut crabs themselves are a sought-after food source for humans, hence their populations have dwindled wherever their habitat has been encroached upon by Homo sapiens. It's inadvisable to hunt them for food unless you know what you're doing, however, because their pincers are very large, very powerful, and can cause significant pain. Fair warning!

"Joe Ball and His Alligator Pond","http://crime.about.com/od/serial/p/joeball.htm","2012-10-26 21:47:38","  By Charles Montaldo
  A Bootlegger Career:
  Joe Ball decided on a career as a bootlegger, over working in a legitimate family business, after he graduated from the University of Texas. By the late 1920s he was the owner of the Sociable Inn, a saloon located near Elmendorf, Texas.
  Alligator Pond:
  As a source of entertainment to his patrons, Ball built a large alligator pond and would invite customers to watch at feeding time; the usual entree being live cats and dogs.
  Women Mysteriously Vanish:
  After several barmaids, girl friends and two of his wives vanished into thin air, the local authorities began to suspect that Ball was up to no good. However, his intimidating nature kept the suspicious and curious at bay.
  One Shot to the Head:
  On September 24, 1948, a group of Texas Rangers decided to go and question Ball about all the missing women. Instead of talking to them, he opted to shoot himself in the head.
  The Handy Man Talks:
  A handy man for Ball, Clifford Wheeler, soon admitted to helping Ball get rid of the bodies of some the women Ball killed.
  He led them to the remains of Hazel Brown and Minnie Gotthard. Wheeler told authorities that Ball murdered at least 20 other women, but the alligators had disposed of any evidence to back up his claim.
  A Neighbor in Fear:
  A neighbor, who had fled to California after fearing that Ball would kill him, admitted to seeing Ball dismembering a body near the alligator pit.
  No Evidence:
  No real evidence was ever found that determined that Ball actually fed his victims remains to the alligators.

"Nephilim Bones: Were Giant Human Skeletons Found in Greece?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/supernaturalwonders/ss/giants_in_greece.htm","2016-02-26 13:55:54","  Description: Viral images and text / Hoax Circulating since: 2009? Status: Fake (see analysis on last page )
  Text example #1: Email contributed by Karen M., March 21, 2010:
  Giants Found in Greece
  I thought this was really cool, how scientists keep finding proof of biblical stories!
  Remember the old testament story of how the Israelites were afraid because of the GIANTS in the land of Canaan.
  Numbers 13:33 - 'There we saw the GIANTS (the descendants of Anak came from the GIANTS); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.'
  Text example #2: Email text contributed by Albert M., March 3, 2011:
  GIANT ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND IN GREECE
  These astounding photos are from a recent archaeological discovery in Greece; This totally unexpected find furnishes proof of the existence of 'Nephilim'. Nephilim is the word used to describe the giants spoken of in biblical times by Enoch as well as the giant David fought against (Goliath). It is generally believed that most of these Giants came about when the fallen angels had union with earthly woman. Note the incredible size of the skull...
  Gen 6:4 There were giants on earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bear children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
  Num 13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
  Images: #1 , #2 , #3 , #4 Enlargements: #1 , #2 , #3 , #4
  There's a good reason we haven't heard about this epic discovery in the New York Times , Scientific American , or any other legitimate publication, and that is that the preceding photos, like the similar one circulating since 2004 purporting to show a giant skeleton found in the Middle East, are fakes.
  As if it weren't preposterous enough to claim that one 15-foot-tall fossilized human skeleton had turned up without media fanfare, we're asked to believe that archaeologists recently dug up four of them in a single location (Greece).
  In point of fact, each of the photos appears to have been taken at a different time and place.
  So far I've only been able to locate the original of one of them, but it serves as clear proof that Photoshopping took place. Image #4 was created by inserting an outsized human skull into a photo of a 1993 University of Chicago dinosaur dig in Niger, Africa (see the original here ). If you look at a blow-up of the doctored image, the skull appears flattened and unnatural (and one of the workers actually appears to be standing on it!).
  Moreover, the same cut-and-pasted skull was used to create image #2 (see side-by-side comparison ). A blow-up of image #2 with brightness and contrast enhanced reveals unnaturally dark 'shadows' around the skull. The skull in image #3 is marked by incongruously bright highlights on the teeth and around the edges of the gaping temple wound. And in image #1 the shadows coming off the skeleton fall more or less toward the camera, while the worker's shadow falls due left, suggesting that elements of two different photos were combined.
  Finally, despite frequent references to 'giants' in ancient mythology and English translations of the Bible, there is no generally accepted scientific or historical evidence that such beings ever actually existed (unless you consider the Weekly World News a reliable source).

  Was an 1,800-pound feral hog killed in Texas? No. The images ( #1 , #2 , #3 ) are mislabeled.
  The earliest version of the caption, dated March 2009, claimed the monster boar was bagged in Texas. An August 2011 version said it was shot in Missouri. Yet another version claimed it was killed in Florida. The truth of the matter is that these photos weren't taken anywhere on the North American continent.
  According to a March 3, 2009 article in the Conroe Courier , no 1,800-pound wild boar has ever been seen near Conroe, Texas — let alone hunted, bagged, and photographed for posterity.
  Your average Texan feral hog weighs in at approximately 150 pounds, says a Texas Parks and Wildlife game warden quoted in the Courier . An exceptionally large one might tip the scales at 300. It's rare to find a wild boar exceeding 400 pounds anywhere in the United States.
  In point of fact, it's doubtful there's a wild boar anywhere in the world that weighs 1,800 pounds. There have been reports of domestic hogs approaching or exceeding that size, but the largest documented specimens in the wild have topped out at 1,100 pounds or less.
  Citing a report in a French hunting magazine, the Courier reveals that the boar in these pictures was actually a 781-pounder killed in Turkey in 2005 (the EXIF data embedded in the images confirms the photos were snapped on June 3 of that year). One visual clue — the 'Nature Tours' logo on the side of a vehicle in one of the photos — indeed points to a Turkish hunting website on which the same images are displayed.

  Watch the [BREAKING NEWS] Malaysia Plane Crash Into Vietnam Sea MH370 Malaysia Airlines is FOUND!
  Analysis: This is a clickjacking scam exploiting public concern over the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370 , which vanished over the South China Sea on March 8, 2014, and is still missing.
  As of this writing, the missing plane has not been found, therefore, obviously, no authentic video of its finding or recovery exists.
  The scam spreads by tricking unwary users into sharing the video in order to view it, causing the blurb to be replicated on friends' news feeds. Users are then redirected to a page where they're instructed to download special video player software -- a very bad idea, given that there's no way of knowing where the software came from or what it really does.
  Similar scams are circulating under the titles ' Malaysian Airlines Finally Found ' and 'Malaysia Plane MH370 Has Been Spotted Somewhere Near Bermuda Triangle.'
  Don't risk the security of your Facebook account or computer by clicking on links in suspicious posts like these. If they turn up in your news feed, delete them. Advise your friends to do the same.

The image above is an artist's rendering of a glass-bottomed skywalk being constructed over the south rim of the Grand Canyon in the Hualapai Indian Reservation by the tribal-owned Grand Canyon Resort Corporation. The walkway will jut 70 feet out from the rim, offering paying visitors the opportunity to safely peer 4,000 feet down to the bottom of the Canyon. The skywalk is part of a larger attraction to be called Grand Canyon West, which will also feature an Indian village and 'western-themed town.'
  Update: Skywalk Officially Opens - Amidst great hooplah, the Grand Canyon Skywalk had its official opening on March 20, 2007 with former astronaut Buzz Aldrin onhand to take the first giant leap over the lip of the Grand Canyon. Read more...

"G.W. Bush Visit to Ft. Hood","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/georgewbush/ss/bush_fort_hood.htm","2016-01-17 03:16:15","  Description: Email rumor Circulating since: Nov. 2009 Status: Partly true
  Example #1: Email contributed by Harold M., Nov. 26, 2009:
  Subject: Fort Hood
  Down in Dothan, AL a man had a TV on in his office when the news of the military base shootings came on. The husband of one of his employees was stationed there. He called her into his office and the minute he told her what was going on, she got a text message from her husband saying, 'I am okay.' The cell phone started ringing right after that. It was an ER nurse. She said, 'I'm the one who just sent you a text, not your husband.' She thought the message would be comforting, but she immediately knew she had to let the wife know what was going on. She said, 'I am sorry but your husband has been shot 4 times and he is in surgery.'
  The wife left Southern Clinic in Dothan and drove all night.
  Miraculously, here is the photo I just received from my brother that was in the hospital room. He is awake and will recover. His wife, who lives in Dothan , made it to Ft. Hood about the time he was waking up. Thought I'd share this great outcome.
  Example #2: Email contributed by an AOL user, Dec. 20, 2009:
  Subject: White House asked Geo W to leave Ft. Hood
  I sent my cousin in Fayetteville, N.C. (retired from Special Forces) that picture of Geo. W. visiting the wounded at Ft. Hood. I got this reply:
  What is even better is the fact George W. Bush heard about Fort Hood, got in his car without any escort, apparently they did not have time to react, and drove to Fort Hood. He was stopped at the gate and the guard could not believe who he had just stopped. Bush only ask for directions to the hospital then drove on. The gate guard called that 'The president Is on 'Fort Hood and driving to the hospital.' The base went bananas looking for Obama. When they found it was Bush they immediately offered escort and Bush simply told them to shut up and let him visit the wounded and the dependents of the dead. He stayed at Fort Hood for over six hours and was finally ask to leave by a message from the White House. Obama flew in days later and held a 'photo ' session in a gym and did not even go to the hospital. All this I picked up from two soldiers here who happened to be at Fort Hood when it happened.

  George W. Bush heard about Fort Hood, got in his car without any escort --- apparently they did not have time to react, and drove to Fort Hood . He was stopped at the gate and the guard could not believe who he had just stopped. Bush only ask for directions to the hospital then drove on. The gate guard called that 'The president Is on Fort Hood and driving to the hospital.' The base went bananas looking for Obama.

  This Bush/Obama/Ft. Hood story is something that should be sent to every voter in the US. Scroll down to see mentioned photo & story.
  Class shows up...
  The doctor had his TV on in his office when the news of the military base shootings came on. The husband of one of his employees was stationed there. He called her into his office and as he told her what had happened, she got a text message from her husband saying,
  'I am okay.' Her cell phone rang right after she read the message. It was an ER nurse, 'I'm the one who just sent you a text, not your husband. I thought it would be comforting but I was mistaken in doing so. I am sorry to tell you this, but your husband has been shot 4 times and he is in surgery.'
  The soldier's wife left Southern Clinic in Dothan and drove all night to Ft. Hood . When she arrived, she found out her husband was out of surgery and would be OK. She rushed to his room and found that he already had visitors there to comfort him. He was just waking up and found his wife and the visitors by his side The nurse took this picture.
  What? No news crews and cameras? This is how people with class respond and pay respect to those in uniform.
  YOU HAVE just been treated to a step-by-step object lesson in how facts are distorted by politics.
  As reported by Fox News and other sources , George W. and Laura Bush did drop by the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center on November 6, 2009 to visit soldiers wounded during the Ft. Hood shooting incident.
  It's not true that the visit was unexpected, however, nor that the Bushes refused an escort when they arrived.
  Bush spokesman David Sherzer told FactCheck.org that Lt. Gen. Robert Cone had requested the visit, which was coordinated with the Secret Service and Army personnel. It lasted two hours, not six.
  It's also 'completely false,' Sherzer was quoted as saying, that the White House asked Bush to leave.
  Yet another falsehood disproven by contemporaneous news coverage is the claim that when Obama visited Ft. Hood on November 10 he 'held a photo session in a gym and did not even go to the hospital.' According to the Dallas Morning News President Obama and the First Lady did, in fact, go to the hospital and visit privately with the injured and their families before and after speaking at the public memorial service that afternoon.

  A picture began circulating in November. It should be 'The Picture of the Year,' or perhaps, 'Picture of the Decade.' It won't be. In fact, unless you obtained a copy of the paper, you probably will never see it. The picture is that of a 21-week-old unborn baby named Samuel Alexander Armas, who is being operated on by a surgeon named Joseph Bruner.
  The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from his mother's womb. Little Samuel's mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner's remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb.
  During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus via C-section and makes a small incision to operate on the baby. During the surgery on little Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed, hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger.
  The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture, 'Hand of Hope.' The text explaining the picture begins, 'The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel Alexander Armas emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life.'
  Little Samuel's mother said they 'wept for days' when they saw the picture.
  She said, 'The photo reminds us my pregnancy isn't about disability or an illness, it's about a little person' 'The Hand' of the fetus. You can see the actual picture, and it is awesome...incredible.
  Pass it on.. The world needs to see this one.

  Hercules: The World's Biggest Dog Ever According to Guinness World Records
  Hercules was recently awarded the honorable distinction of Worlds Biggest Dog by Guinness World Records. Hercules is an English Mastiff and has a 38 inch neck and weighs 282 pounds.
  With 'paws the size of softballs' (reports the Boston Herald), the three-year-old monster is far larger and heavier than his breed's standard 200lb. limit. Hercules owner Mr. Flynn says that Hercules weight is natural and not induced by a bizarre diet: 'I fed him normal food and he just grew'.... and grew. and grew.
  Thanks to some clever Photoshop manipulation, the dog pictured above (which is actually a Neapolitan mastiff as near as I can tell, not an English mastiff as claimed) looks roughly twice its natural size. It's an obvious hoax. This can also be achieved by forced perspective, with the dog being much closer to the camera than the people and horse in the background. However, in this case, there are shadows that appear to be all in line, which would require photo manipulation if forced perspective was used.
  It is true that back in 2001, Joe Flynn, owner of a 282-pound English mastiff named Hercules, was told by the Guinness World Records folks that his was the world's 'heaviest' dog at the time. This is not that animal.
  Dog breeders say that Neapolitan mastiffs top out at around 29 inches tall at the shoulder and 165 pounds in weight. Maybe the people and the horse in the photo are abnormally small. In any case, it interesting that neither the photographer nor the owner of the behemoth canine has surfaced to validate its authenticity.
  World's Largest (Tallest) Dog: As of April 2, 2008, a harlequin Great Dane named Gibson was the Guinness World Record holder. He died of bone cancer on August 13, 2009.
  Gibson was succeeded by another Great Dane, Titan. Then in 2010, Giant George, a blue Great Dane in Tucson, Arizona, was measured as being 0.375 inches taller than Titan. He was confirmed as the Tallest Living Dog and Tallest Dog Ever.
  Zeus, a Great Dane in Kalamazoo, Michigan, earned the award for World's Tallest Dog Ever. He received this designation on October 4, 2011 and was measured at 44 inches tall (1.118 meters). He passed away in 2015.
  The tallest living dog - male and tallest living dog - female records are to be found continuously updated on the Guinness World Records website. There is no largest (heaviest) living dog category at this time, perhaps due to concerns that pets would be encouraged to become unhealthily overweight.

  He weighs in at 22 pounds and measures a little over 3 feet. he is a breed of rabbit called german giant (how appropriate!). This is his owner, Hans Wagner, struggling to hold him up. from the NY Post article:
  We don't feed him an unusual diet said Wagner. He goes through more than his brothers and sisters, but he eats the same food mix. His favorite food is actually lettuce. He can never get enough of it.
  LOOK AT THOSE FEET!
  Analysis: The above image has appeared in a number of newspapers in the U.S. and abroad, all of which attest to its authenticity while reporting somewhat inconsistent measurements for the giant bunny depicted.
  
  I was able to find very little information on the 'German Giant' breed of rabbit, though online sources confirm that full-grown specimens of the British and Flemish variants of the breed can indeed weigh up to 10 kg. (22 lbs.).
  Even at the higher figure, Herman appears to fall just short of being the largest bunny on record, pound for pound. In 2004, the BBC ran a story on a British Giant named Roberto , who stood a few inches taller than Herman and tipped the scales, allegedly, at a whopping 35 lbs. A spokesperson for the Guinness Book of World Records , which no longer issues official titles for such categories, was quoted as saying Roberto was the biggest rabbit they'd ever heard of.

  Description: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: May 2006 Status:  True (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Lisa S., May 15, 2006:
  
  If you read the front page story of the SF Chronicle, you would have read about a female humpback whale who had become entangled in a spider web of crab traps and lines.
  She was weighted down by hundreds of pounds of traps that caused her to struggle to stay afloat. She also had hundreds of yards of line rope wrapped around her body, her tail, her torso, a line tugging in her mouth.
  A fisherman spotted her just east of the Farralone Islands (outside the Golden Gate) and radioed an environmental group for help.
  Within a few hours, the rescue team arrived and determined that she was so bad off, the only way to save her was to dive in and untangle her...
  
  A very dangerous proposition.
  One slap of the tail could kill a rescuer.
  They worked for hours with curved knives and eventually freed her.
  When she was free, the divers say she swam in what seemed like joyous circles.
  She then came back to each and every diver, one at a time, and nudged them, pushed gently around-she thanked them. Some said it was the most incredibly beautiful experience of their lives.
  
  The guy who cut the rope out of her mouth says her eye was following him the whole time, and he will never be the same.
  May you, and all those you love, be so blessed and fortunate .... to be surrounded by people who will help you get untangled from the things that are binding you.
  And, may you always know the joy of giving and receiving gratitude.
  I pass this on to you, my friend, in the same spirit.
  
  The rescue operation was both difficult and dangerous. Crew members found the whale entwined in some 20 ropes, each 240 feet long and wrapped so tight they were slicing into its flesh. The lines had to be cut by hand, which required diving perilously close to the whale and its powerful tail. It took about an hour, and no one was injured.
  In interviews with reporters, some of the divers remarked on the whale's 'affectionate' behavior. One said the creature watched and seemed to wink at him as he was cutting a line that went through its mouth. Once freed, the whale began circling and approached the divers one by one to 'nuzzle' them. 'You hate to anthropomorphize too much,' Mick Menigoz told the San Francisco Chronicle , 'but the whale was doing little dives and the guys were rubbing shoulders with it. I don't know for sure what it was thinking, but it's something that I will always remember. It was just too cool.'
  According to Jennifer Kennedy, About.com's Guide to Marine Life, as many as 30 whale entanglement incidents happen per year, and rescue efforts can be quite dangerous for the humans involved. See her article, Whales and Entanglements: The Dangerous Job of Disentangling Whales .

"Shakespearean "Love" in A Midsummer Night's Dream","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/socialpoliticalissues/ss/illegal_super_highway.htm","2016-02-28 22:20:56","  By Adam Burgess
  A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1600) has been called one of William Shakespeare’s greatest love plays. It has been interpreted as a romantic story in which love ultimately conquers all odds. However, A Midsummer Night’s Dream is actually a written piece on the importance of fertility, not love. Shakespeare’s ideas about love are represented by the powerless young lovers, by the meddling faeries and their magical love, and by forced love as opposed to chosen love. All of these points undermine the argument that this play is a typical “love story” and help build the case that Shakespeare actually intends to demonstrate the powers of sex and fertility over love.
  The first idea of love is its powerlessness, represented by the “true” lovers. Lysander and Hermia are the only two characters in the play who are actually in love. Yet, their love is forbidden both by Hermia’s father and by Duke Theseus. Hermia’s father speaks of Lysander’s love as witchcraft, saying Lysander is “the man that bewitched the bosom of my child” and “with feigning voice verses of feigning love/stol’n the impression of her fantasy” (27, 31-2).
  continue reading below our video
  Test Your General Science Knowledge
  These lines prove that true love is an illusion, a false ideal.
  Egeus goes on to say that Hermia belongs to him, proclaiming, “she is mine, and all my right of her/I do estate unto Demetrius” (97-98). These lines demonstrate the lack of power that Hermia and Lysander’s love holds in the presence of familial law . Furthermore, Demetrius tells Lysander to “yield thy crazéd title to my certain right,” which means that it is only to the worthiest suitor that a father must give his daughter, regardless of love (91-2).
  Finally, Hermia and Lysander’s eventually wedlock is due to two things: faerie intervention and noble decree. The faeries enchant Demetrius to fall in love with Helena , therefor freeing Theseus to allow Hermia and Lysander’s union. With his words, “Egeus, I will overbear your will; / For in the temple, by and by, with us / These couples shall eternally be knit,” Theseus is proving that it is not love which is responsible for the joining of two people, but the will of those in power (178-80). Thus, even for the true lovers, it is not love which conquers, but power in the form of royal decree.
  The second idea, the weakness of love, comes in the form of faerie magic . The four young lovers and the imbecilic actor are entangled in a love game, puppet-mastered by Oberon and Puck. The faerie’s meddling causes both Lysander and Demetrius, who were fighting over Hermia, to fall for Helena. Lysander’s confusion even leads him to believe he hates Hermia; he asks her,“Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know / the hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?” (189-90). That his love is so easily extinguished and turned to hatred shows that even a true lover’s fire can be put out by the feeblest wind.
  Furthermore, Titania, the powerful faerie goddess, is bewitched into falling in love with Bottom, who has been given a donkey’s head by mischievous Puck . When Titania exclaims “What visions have I seen! / Methought I was enamored of an ass,” we are meant to see that love will cloud our judgment and make even the normally level-headed person do foolish things (75-76). Ultimately, Shakespeare makes the point that love cannot be trusted to withstand any length of time, and that lovers are made into fools.
  Finally, Shakespeare gives us two examples of choosing powerful unions, rather than amorous ones, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream . First, there is the tale of Theseus and Hippolyta . In lines 16-17, Theseus says to Hippolyta, “I wooed thee with my sword / And won thy love doing thee injuries.” Thus, the first relationship that we are greeted with is the result of Theseus claiming Hippolyta after defeating her in battle. Rather than courting and loving her, Theseus has conquered and enslaved her. He creates the union for solidarity and strength between the two kingdoms.
  Next is the example of Oberon and Titania , whose separation from each other results in the world becoming barren. Titania exclaims, “The spring, the summer / The childing autumn, angry winter, change / Their wonted liveries, and the mazéd world / By their increase now knows not which is which” (111-14). These lines make it clear that it is not in consideration of love that these two must be joined, but in consideration of the fertility and health of the world. In general, then, it is not love that decides who should be joined, but the fertileness created by the union.
  The sub-plots in A Midsummer Night’s Dream demonstrate Shakespeare’s dissatisfaction with the idea of love as a supreme power, and his belief that power and fertility are the two prime factors in deciding a union. The images of greenery and nature throughout the story, as when Puck speaks of Titania and Oberon meeting neither “in grove or green / By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen” further suggest the importance that Shakespeare places on fertility (28-29). Also, the faerie presence within Athens at the end of the play, as sung by Oberon, suggests that lust is the enduring power and, without it, love cannot last: “Now, until the break of day / Through this house each fairy stray / To the best bride-bed will we / Which by us shall blessed be” (196-99).
  Ultimately, Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream suggests that believing only in love, creating bonds based on a fleeting notion rather than on lasting principles such as fertility (offspring) and power (security), is to be “enamored of an ass.”

"The Haunted Painting","http://paranormal.about.com/od/trueghoststories/a/The-Haunted-Painting.htm","2015-11-15 17:31:59","  Can inanimate objects be haunted? Can a spirit attach itself to a particular thing and then cause unexplained events to occur around it?
  I received an interesting story from a reader, Laura P., whose avocation is painting. An accomplished painter, Laura has sold many of her works to individuals and businesses around the US. One painting in particular, however, is unlike any other that Laura has ever done. Its subject matter, to begin with, is most unusual: it is based on a paranormal photograph -- a photograph that may have captured the image of a headless ghost.
  
  Could this ghost have attached itself to Laura's painting? Read her story... and you decide.
  In 1994, James Kidd, a commercial photographer, placed one of his photos on display at a gallery in Tombstone, Arizona where I was showing some of my oil paintings. The photo was the old stagecoach stop at Tombstone.
  He first took a photo of the stagecoach stop and an old stagecoach, and then he didn't wind his camera so he could get a double exposure photo with another old wagon in the foreground.
  When the picture was developed, however, it revealed something unexpected. Standing on a log to the left of the wagon is a figure that the photographer did not see when he took the picture. Upon close inspection, the figure appears to be a headless man! The figure's coat, pants and boots are quite plain and easy to see. But he has no head. The photographer says the photo has been examined by Kodak and other experts to prove that he did not doctor it in any way. [The original photo can be seen at Ghosts of Tombstone .]
  I couldn't get over that photo and asked him if I could do an oil painting of it. (I do most of my paintings from photos I've taken.) He said I could. Back home in Sierra Vista, Arizona, I began work on a 16 x 20-inch oil painting based on the photo.
  When I was about half way through completing the painting, I started getting a strange feeling.
  I began to ask myself: Why on earth did I want to paint this picture? And maybe I should never have started it. But I did finish it. And then some very strange, unexplained things began to happen around my home -- seemingly centered around that painting.
  I do not believe in ghosts , but I cannot for the life of me explain how or why these strange things have happened . I cannot attribute every one of these events directly to the painting, but they have all taken place since it has been in my house -- and are totally unexplained .
  THE HAUNTING BEGINS
  Office havoc. I took the framed painting with some others for a display in a business location. We hung the ghost painting on the wall behind an office desk. Three days later, people from the office called and asked me to come pick up the ghost painting. Every morning, they claimed, the painting was crooked. They would straighten it, and the next morning it would be crooked again. Also, appointments were inexplicably messed up and papers went missing. They were actually afraid of it. I took the painting back.
  Mysterious leak. In 1995, my husband and I moved into a brand new home in Tennessee. We wondered if these ghostly goings-on would stop. But they didn't. Oddly, the roof on the garage of this new home had a leak when it rained. The roofers came out three times to repair it, and although they worked on it they said they could not find the cause of the leak. It didn't make any sense. Nothing they did stopped the darn leak. Finally, my husband asked me where the ghost painting was. It was leaning against the wall between the living room and garage. We moved the painting... and the garage roof never leaked again.
  Next page: The Haunting Intensifies
  Spilled salt. One evening I was preparing dinner. We had an island bar and that is where I set the table. I picked up the salt and pepper shakers, which were two little canning jars with handles, and set them on the bar. I went to the door and called to my husband that dinner was ready. When I got back to the bar, salt was spilled all over it and on the floor. The salt shaker, standing upright, was still where I had set it down.
  We have no animals or children in the house to blame for the spill. It is completely unexplained.
  Telekinetic starfish. My husband and I were sitting in the garage talking to the little neighbor girl who had come over to visit. On the garage wall were three large dried starfish. They were hanging securely on roofing nails.
  The garage door was open, but there was no wind blowing or air movement. Suddenly, the largest starfish came sailing off the wall and landed on the concrete floor. It sailed across the floor about six to seven feet.
  Broken gate. A heavy gate that would have been hard to remove, came off its post for no apparent reason. All the hardware was completely intact.
  The chipped glass. This event really scared me because it could have injured me. We had been doing some yard work and went into the garage to rest where it was cool. My husband said he would mix us some drinks. He returned with the drinks in thick gold-colored glasses with ice cubes. We finished our drinks, and he said he was going to have another and I said I would too.
  So he mixed them in the house and brought them out. I had taken one or two sips from my drink when I looked down to see that a large chunk of glass had been broken off the top of the glass.
  It was perfectly fine the first time I drank from it. Right away I thought my husband had knocked it on something, but he swore he hadn't.
  We looked all over the garage floor for the piece of glass, but found nothing. We went into the house where my husband fixed the drinks and got down on the floor with flashlights and looked. Nothing. I poured the rest of the drink through a strainer to see if the chunk of glass had fallen in, but there was nothing. The missing piece was too large to swallow without me noticing it, but I still had this sick feeling in my stomach. We never found the missing piece of glass.
  The disbeliever. I have always taken photos of the paintings I have done. People ask to see the photos of my paintings and most always say they don't want to touch the photo of the ghost painting. The gals at the beauty shop wanted me to bring my pictures in, and one woman started bragging that she did not believe in ghosts and that it was silly of them to avoid touching the picture. 'Just let me see it,' she said. She took the photo, looked at it closely and just laughed. That night at her house, a clock that had been on the wall for 40 years, fell down and broke into a hundred pieces.
  The hazy figure plays a hand. Our neighbor wanted to show his mother-in-law the photos of my paintings and took them home with him. They left the pictures laying on the table and started playing a three-handed card game in which a dummy hand must be dealt. When they picked up the dummy hand, every card of the dummy hand was in one suit. That scared them to death, he told me. He got up and went outside to move his water sprinkler, and to this day he still swears that he could see a white hazy figure of a person come around the corner. He came running back to my house with the pictures and said he never wanted to touch them again.
  Knock knock. The last thing this ghost did was knock on our front door. My husband and I both heard it at the same time. But our two German Shepherds did not hear the knock. Nobody was at the door.
  Currently, the painting is hanging in our house. A few people have asked to buy the painting, but I am afraid to sell it. What would an unhappy ghost do in their lives?
  I still don't actually believe in ghosts... Yet if I had it to do over, I would not have created this painting.
  Coincidences? Overactive imaginations? Or is it just possible that some unknown energy surrounds the portrait of the headless ghost?
  Anyone want to buy a painting?

  The headstone you see in the image above is not Cochran's, however. For one thing, his first name is misspelled 'Johnny' (Cochran spelled it 'Johnnie'). For another, the 'photo' was obviously created using a website called 'The Original Tombstone Generator' (now defunct) which allowed users to add an inscription of their choice to a standard gravestone image (see screenshot at right).
  The joke, for the benefit of those unlikely few who missed the celebrity trial of the '90s, plays on the opinion held by many that accused wife-murderer O.J. Simpson, though acquitted, was actually guilty and that Cochran, who headed up Simpson's defense team, must have known that even though he helped the former football star beat the rap in court.

"Woodrow Wilson","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/fl/Photo-of-Darren-Wilson-Injuries-Is-a-Hoax.htm","2016-07-29 18:58:05","  Woodrow Wilson served two terms as the 28th President of the United States . He began his career as a scholar and educator, and later gained national recognition as the reform-minded governor of New Jersey.
  Just two years after becoming governor, he was elected president of the United States. Despite his isolationist leanings, Wilson oversaw American involvement in World War I and was a key figure in brokering the peace between the Allied and Central powers.
  Following the war, Wilson presented his ' Fourteen Points ,' a plan to prevent future wars, and proposed the creation of the League of Nations, a predecessor to the United Nations .
  Woodrow Wilson suffered a massive stroke during his second term, but did not leave office. Details of his illness were hidden from the public while his wife carried out many of his duties for him. President Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize .
  Dates: December 29, * 1856 – February 3, 1924

  10 Best Universities in the United States
  Also Known As: Thomas Woodrow Wilson
  Famous Quote: 'War isn't declared in the name of God; it is a human affair entirely.'
  Thomas Woodrow Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia to Joseph and Janet Wilson on December 29, 1856. He joined older sisters Marion and Annie (younger brother Joseph would arrive ten years later).
  Joseph Wilson, Sr. was a Presbyterian minister of Scottish heritage; his wife, Janet Woodrow Wilson, had emigrated to the U.S. from Scotland as a young girl. The family moved to Augusta, Georgia in 1857 when Joseph was offered a job with the local ministry.
  During the Civil War , Reverend Wilson's church and surrounding land functioned as a hospital and campground for injured Confederate soldiers. Young Wilson, after seeing up close the kind of suffering war could produce, became vehemently opposed to war and remained so when he later served as president.
  'Tommy,' as he was called, didn't attend school until he was nine (partly because of the war) and did not learn to read until the age of eleven. Some historians now believe that Wilson suffered from a form of dyslexia . Wilson compensated for his deficit by teaching himself shorthand as a teenager, enabling him to take notes in class.
  In 1870, the family moved to Columbia, South Carolina when Reverend Wilson was hired as a minister and professor of theology at a prominent Presbyterian church and seminary. Tommy Wilson attended a private school, where he kept up with his studies but did not distinguish himself academically.
  Wilson left home in 1873 to attend Davidson College in South Carolina. He only stayed for two semesters before becoming physically ill trying to keep up with his coursework and extracurricular activities. Poor health would plague Wilson his entire life.
  In the fall of 1875, after taking time off to regain his health, Wilson enrolled at Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey). His father, an alumnus of the school, had helped him get admitted.
  Wilson was one of a handful of southerners who attended Princeton in the decade after the Civil War. Many of his southern classmates resented northerners, but Wilson did not. He firmly believed in maintaining the unity of the states.
  By now, Wilson had developed a love of reading and spent a lot of time in the school library. His tenor singing voice won him a spot in the glee club and he became known for his skills as a debater. Wilson also wrote articles for the campus magazine and later became its editor.
  After graduating from Princeton in 1879, Wilson made an important decision. He would serve the public — not by becoming a minister, as his father had done — but by becoming an elected official. And the best path to public office, Wilson believed, was to earn a law degree.
  Wilson entered law school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville in autumn of 1879. He didn't enjoy the study of law; for him, it was a means to an end. As he had done at Princeton, Wilson participated in debate club and the choir. He distinguished himself as an orator and drew large audiences when he spoke.
  During weekends and holidays, Wilson visited relatives in nearby Staunton, Virginia, where he had been born. There, he became smitten by his first cousin, Hattie Woodrow. The attraction was not mutual. Wilson proposed marriage to Hattie in the summer of 1880 and was devastated when she rejected him.
  Back in school, the dejected Wilson (who now preferred to be called 'Woodrow' rather than “Tommy”), became seriously ill with a respiratory infection. He was forced to drop out of law school and return home to recuperate.
  After regaining his health, Wilson completed his law studies from home and passed the bar exam in May 1882 at the age of 25.
  Woodrow Wilson moved to Atlanta, Georgia in the summer of 1882 and opened a law practice with a colleague. He soon realized that not only was it difficult to find clients in a large city but that he also disliked practicing law. The practice did not prosper and Wilson was miserable; he knew he must find a meaningful career.
  Because he loved to study government and history, Wilson decided to become a teacher. He began his studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland in the fall of 1883.
  While visiting relatives in Georgia earlier in the year, Wilson had met and fallen in love with Ellen Axson, the daughter of a minister. They became engaged in September 1883, but could not marry right away because Wilson was still in school and Ellen was caring for her ailing father.
  Wilson proved himself an able scholar at Johns Hopkins. He became a published author at 29 years old when his doctoral thesis, Congressional Government , was published in 1885. Wilson received praise for his critical analysis of the practices of congressional committees and lobbyists.
  On June 24, 1885, Woodrow Wilson married Ellen Axson in Savannah, Georgia. In 1886, Wilson received his doctorate in history and political science. He was hired to teach at Bryn Mawr, a small women's college in Pennsylvania.
  Wilson taught at Bryn Mawr for two years. He was well-respected and enjoyed teaching, but living conditions were very cramped on the small campus.
  After the arrival of daughters Margaret in 1886 and Jessie in 1887, Wilson began to search for a new teaching position. Buoyed by his growing reputation as a teacher, writer, and orator, Wilson received an offer for a higher-paying position at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut in 1888.
  The Wilsons welcomed a third daughter, Eleanor, in 1889.
  At Wesleyan, Wilson became a popular history and political science professor. He involved himself in school organizations, as a faculty football advisor and leader of debate events. As busy as he was, Wilson found the time to write a well-regarded government textbook, winning praise from educators.
  Yet Wilson longed to teach at a larger school. When offered a position in 1890 to teach law and political economy at his alma mater, Princeton, he eagerly accepted.
  Woodrow Wilson spent 12 years teaching at Princeton, where he was repeatedly voted most popular professor. Wilson also managed to write prolifically, publishing a biography of George Washington in 1897 and a five-volume history of the American people in 1902.
  Upon the retirement of University President Francis Patton in 1902, 46-year-old Woodrow Wilson was named president of the university. He was the first layperson to hold that title.
  During Wilson's Princeton administration, he oversaw several improvements, including expanding the campus and building additional classrooms. He also hired more teachers so that there could be smaller, more intimate classes, which he believed were beneficial to students. Wilson raised the admission standards at the university, making it more selective than before.
  In 1906, Wilson's stressful lifestyle took a toll — he temporarily lost vision in one eye, probably due to a stroke. Wilson recovered after taking some time off.
  In June of 1910, Wilson was approached by a group of politicians and businessmen who had been taking note of his many successful endeavors. The men wanted him to run for governor of New Jersey. This was Wilson's opportunity to fulfill the dream he'd had as a young man.
  After winning the nomination at the Democratic Convention in September 1910, Woodrow Wilson resigned from Princeton in October to run for governor of New Jersey.
  Campaigning across the state, Wilson impressed crowds with his eloquent speeches. He insisted that if he were elected governor, he would serve the people without being influenced by big business or party bosses (powerful, often corrupt men who controlled political organizations). Wilson won the election by a healthy margin in November 1910.
  As governor, Wilson brought about a number of reforms. Because he objected to the selection of political candidates by the 'boss' system, Wilson implemented primary elections.
  In an effort to regulate billing practices of powerful utilities companies, Wilson proposed guidelines for a public utilities commission, a measure which was quickly passed into law. Wilson also contributed to the passage of a law that would protect workers from unsafe working conditions and compensate them if they were injured on the job.
  Wilson's record of sweeping reforms brought him national attention and led to speculation of a possible presidential candidacy in the 1912 election. 'Wilson for President' clubs opened up in cities across the country. Convinced he had a chance of winning the nomination, Wilson readied himself to campaign on the national stage.
  Wilson went into the Democratic National Convention of 1912 as an underdog to Champ Clark, House Speaker, as well as other popular candidates. After dozens of roll calls — and in part due to the support of previous presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan — the vote shifted in favor of Wilson. He was declared the Democratic candidate in the race for president.
  Wilson faced a unique challenge — he was running against two men, each of whom had already held the highest office in the land: incumbent William Taft, a Republican, and former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as an independent.
  With Republican votes divided between Taft and Roosevelt, Wilson easily won the election. He didn't win the popular vote, but did win a vast majority of the electoral vote (435 for Wilson, while Roosevelt received 88 and Taft only 8). In just two years, Woodrow Wilson had gone from being the president of Princeton to the president of the United States. He was 56 years old.
  Wilson set forth his goals early in his administration. He would focus on reforms, such as the tariff system, currency and banking, oversight of natural resources, and legislation to regulate food, labor, and sanitation. Wilson's plan was known as the 'New Freedom.'
  During Wilson's first year in office, he oversaw the passage of key pieces of legislation. The Underwood Tariff Bill, passed in 1913, lowered the tax on imported items, resulting in lower prices for consumers. The Federal Reserve Act created a system of federal banks and a board of experts that would regulate interest rates and the circulation of money.
  Wilson also sought to limit the powers of big business. He faced an uphill battle, convincing Congress of the need for new antitrust legislation that would prevent the formation of monopolies. Taking his case first to the people (who in turn contacted their congressmen), Wilson was able to get the Clayton Antitrust Act passed in 1914, along with legislation that established the Federal Trade Commission.
  In April 1914, Wilson's wife became gravely ill with Bright's disease , an inflammation of the kidneys. Because no effective treatments were available at the time, Ellen Wilson's condition worsened. She died on August 6, 1914 at the age of 54, leaving Wilson lost and bereft.
  In the midst of his grief, however, Wilson was obligated to run a nation. Recent events in Europe had taken center stage following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914. European nations soon took sides in the conflict that escalated into the First World War , with the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France, and Russia), squaring off against the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary).
  Determined to stay out of the conflict, Wilson issued a Neutrality Proclamation in August 1914. Even after the Germans sank the British passenger ship Lusitania off the Irish coast in May 1915, killing 128 American passengers, Wilson resolved to keep the United States out of the war.
  In the spring of 1915, Wilson met and began courting Washington widow Edith Bolling Galt. She brought happiness back into the president's life. They were married in December 1915.
  As the war raged on, Wilson dealt with problems closer to home.
  He helped avert a railroad strike in the summer of 1916, when railroad workers threatened a nationwide strike if they were not granted an eight-hour work day. Railroad owners refused to negotiate with union leaders, leading Wilson to go before a joint session of Congress to plead for legislation of an eight-hour work day. Congress passed the legislation, much to the disgust of railroad owners and other business leaders.
  Despite being branded a puppet of the unions, Wilson went on to win the Democratic nomination for his second run for president. In a close race, Wilson managed to beat Republican challenger Charles Evans Hughes in November 1916.
  Deeply troubled by the war in Europe, Wilson offered to help broker a peace between the warring nations. His offer was ignored. Wilson proposed the creation of a League for Peace, which promoted the notion of 'peace without victory.' Again, his suggestions were rejected.
  Wilson broke off all diplomatic relations with Germany in February 1917, after Germany announced that it would continue submarine warfare against all ships, including non-military vessels. Wilson realized that U.S. involvement in the war had become inevitable.
  On April 2, 1917, President Wilson announced to Congress that the United States had no choice but to enter World War I. Both the Senate and the House quickly approved Wilson's declaration of war.
  General John J. Pershing was placed in command of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) and the first American soldiers left for France in June 1917. It would take more than a year before the inclusion of American forces helped to turn the tide in favor of the Allies.
  By the fall of 1918, the Allies clearly had the upper hand. The Germans signed the armistice on November 18, 1918.
  In January 1919, President Wilson, hailed as a hero for helping to end the war, joined European leaders in France for a peace conference.
  At the conference, Wilson presented his plan to promote worldwide peace, which he called 'The Fourteen Points.' The most important of these points was the creation of a League of Nations, whose members would consist of representatives from every nation. The League's primary goal would be to avoid further wars by using negotiations to settle differences.
  Delegates at the conference for the Treaty of Versailles voted to approve Wilson's proposal of the League.
  Following the war, Wilson turned his attention to the issue of women's voting rights. After years of only half-heartedly supporting women's suffrage, Wilson committed himself to the cause. The 19th Amendment , granting women the right to vote, was passed in June 1919.
  For Wilson, the stresses of being a wartime president, combined with his losing battle for the League of Nations, took a devastating toll. He was stricken by a massive stroke in September 1919.
  Severely debilitated, Wilson had difficulty speaking and was paralyzed on the left side of his body. He was unable to walk, let alone lobby Congress for his cherished League of Nations proposal. (The Treaty of Versailles would not be ratified by Congress, which meant that the United States could not become a member of the League of Nations.)
  Edith Wilson did not want the American public to know the extent of Wilson's incapacitation. She instructed his physician to issue a statement that the president was suffering from exhaustion and a nervous breakdown. Edith protected her husband, allowing only his physician and a few family members to see him.
  Concerned members of Wilson's administration feared that the president was incapable of carrying out his duties, but his wife insisted he was up to the job. In fact, Edith Wilson accepted documents on her husband's behalf, decided which ones needed attention, then helped him hold the pen in his hand to sign them.
  Wilson remained very weakened by the stroke, but did recover to the extent that he could walk short distances with a cane. He completed his term in January 1921 after Republican Warren G. Harding was elected in a landslide victory.
  Prior to leaving office, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts toward world peace.
  The Wilsons moved into a house in Washington after leaving the White House. In an era when presidents did not receive pensions, the Wilsons had little money to live on. Generous friends came together to raise money for them, enabling them to live comfortably. Wilson made very few public appearances after his retirement, but when he did appear in public, he was greeted by cheers.
  Three years after leaving office, Woodrow Wilson died at his home on February 3, 1924 at the age of 67. He was buried in a crypt in the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.
  Wilson is considered by many historians one of the ten greatest U.S. presidents.
  
  *All of Wilson's documents list his birth date as December 28, 1856, but an entry in the Wilson family bible clearly states he was born after midnight, early on the morning of December 29.

"The Man on Page 602","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/catalog.htm","2014-11-25 21:23:01","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  I read somewhere that in a 1975 Sears catalog, there is a penis visible in one of the pictures. Is this true? It sounds kind of urban legend-y to me, but I'm curious to know.
  Dear Reader:
  One man's 'penis' is another man's 'innocent blotch,' if you know what I mean.
  I'm old enough to remember chuckling furtively over the photo in 1975 when friends were passing the infamous Sears catalog around. Opinion seemed to be divided about half-and-half  some of us were utterly convinced that what we were looking at was the real deal, so to speak, while others scoffed. Cecil Adams has compared it to a Rorschach Test  i.e., the phallus is in the eye of the beholder.
  Real or not, the 'peeking penis' caused quite a stir at the time. Sears eventually tried to explain the phenomenon away as a printing blemish, but by then it had already been immortalized by country singer Jack Barlow (a.k.a. 'Zoot Fenster') in a popular novelty song called 'The Man on Page 602.'

"Lucky Foods To Eat On New Year's Eve Around the World","http://foodtravel.about.com/od/Holiday-Food-Travel/tp/Lucky-Foods-To-Eat-On-New-Years-Eve-Around-the-World.htm","2016-11-25 15:00:41","  New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are full of traditions to ensure a lucky start to the next year.  If you want to have a particularly lucky year, you could incorporate all of the foods considered lucky all across the world.  Or, pick your favorite, cross your fingers, and hope that your new year is a good one.
  Grapes are the lucky food of choice in Spain, Portugal, and much of the Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries in South America.  In Spain, revelers must consume the 12 grapes within the first 12 seconds of the new year while in South American countries, celebrants must consume twelve grapes before the clock tolls midnight.  Each grape represents a different month of the new year, so a sour fifth grape might mean that May will be a difficult month.  Peruvians go one step further by eating a thirteenth grape after the clock rolls over to the next year.
  Pigs and pork have been a symbol of good luck and a traditional food to eat on New Year's Day for centuries.  In the European Middle Ages, wild pigs were caught, slaughtered, and roasted on New Year's Day.
  Later, pigs or pork was given as presents to other families to signify wealth and prosperity.  Also, pigs root by moving forward so much of the western world eats pork to signify moving forward into the new year.  For example, Cubans eat roast suckling pig while Swedes will eat roasted pigs' feet. Eastern Europeans often eat spit roasted pig or roast pork loin.
  Germans go one step further with the pork concept.  There, marzipan pigs known as Glücksschwein (lucky pigs) are given at New Year's Eve to signify luck in the coming year.
  Cooked greens resemble folded money and some believe that eating cooked greens will bring good fortune in the coming year.  In the Southeastern United States, for example, braised collard greens are a traditional part of a New Year's Day meal.
  In South America and Asia, people consume gold colored foods to bring in good fortune in the new year.  For example, Peruvians eat papas a la huanchaina, potatoes tinted with turmeric or saffron. Chinese families eat oranges and, in the Southern United States, people will eat golden cornbread.  Lentils are also another popular New Year's dish around the world.
  In the American Southeast, people eat black eyed peas mixed with rice and bell peppers on New Year's Day.  This dish is known as Hoppin' John , but when eaten on the day after New Year's Day, it's called Skippin' Jenny.  The black eyed peas symbolize luck and prosperity because they resemble coins and there are many of them.  Southerners believe that it's important to eat lots of black eyed peas for luck for the new year!

  Analysis: This is a prank. The sign is bogus. The full text reads as follows:
  PLEASE NOTE:
  As an insurance measure due in part to a recent string of robberies, African-American customers are now required to pay an additional fee of $1.50 per transaction.
  Thank you for your cooperation, McDonald's Corporation (800) 225-5532
  An internal clue: Apparently the perpetrators of the hoax wanted to make sure it was easily identifiable as such. If you dial the 800-number listed on the sign, the party you actually reach is KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), not McDonald's. The companies aren't related.
  McDonald's tweeted back: 'That pic is a senseless & ignorant hoax,' a McDonald's representative tweeted soon after the image 'went viral' on June 12, 2011. 'McD's values ALL our customers. Diversity runs deep in our culture on both sides of the counter.'
  McDonald's official statement: The company also issued a statement for publication on Mashable.com:
  The sign is obviously a hoax. As a company and a brand we have a long and proud history of diversity inclusion across our system on both sides of the counter.
  From our management crew, franchisees — across the board, we’re very proud of our record of diversity. This is unfortunately an example of how rumors can outspeed the truth. Over the last 48 hours we’ve been tweeting and striving to clarify that this is a hoax.

"Photos of a Mermaid or Merman Found on a Beach","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/supernaturalwonders/ss/Merman-Pictures.htm","2015-11-30 15:24:20","  Description: Viral images Circulating since: July 2006 Status: Fake
  Text example: Contributed by a reader, August 24, 2006:
  Fwd: FW: believe it or not Good morning all.............. THIS IS FOUND IN THE PHILIPPINES SHORE OF SORSOGON. AND THIS IS FOR REAL, WE DO HAVE THIS KIND OF CREATURES IN THE PHILIPPINES. BELIEVE OR NOT ITS UP TO YOU!!!!! This creature was found along the shores of Sorsogon.
  Is it a merman? A mermaid? Is it some sort of never-before-seen alien bloodsucking denizen of the deep, half-fish and half-vampire, that coincidentally bears an uncanny resemblance to the snaggletoothed Count Orlock in F.W. Murnau's 1922 film Nosferatu ?
  Or is it yet another ersatz 'sea monster' fabricated for sale on eBay?
  If you were thinking it could be anything other than the latter, you ought to dial your skeptic-o-meter up a notch.
  'Merfolk' are creatures of myth and legend. They don't exist. And in the unlikely event that such a creature really were discovered on a lonely beach somewhere in the world, it would make international headlines. You'd be reading about it in the New York Times or watching video of it on CNN.
  The emails containing these images variously claim the specimen was found on a beach in South Africa, the Philippines, or Malaysia. These were lies made up after the fact. The first place the images turned up was on eBay, where the seller, a Tampa, Florida resident using the screen name 'Seamystery,' described the sale item as a 'golden mermaid found dead on a lonely Florida beach.' It was 'a few inches shy of being 5 feet long' and lay on a 'Fresh natural bed of seaweed.' The circumstances of the discovery were described as follows:
  Another mermaid or sea monster? Yes, unlikely as it seems, 'Seamystery' has auctioned off items like this before and since, including one specimen billed as a 'REAL sea monkey monster corpse,' which, I discovered, was also up for sale on the website of celebrated taxidermy artist Juan Cabana . Front and center on Cabana's home page was a photo of the 'golden mermaid.'
  Take the Poll: Do you believe mermaids really exist? 1) Yes 2) No 3) Unsure 4) Current results
  Which cinched it, as far as I was concerned. 'Seamystery' is Juan Cabana and Juan Cabana was the creator of the mysterious object 'found' on Fort Desoto Beach. So I wrote to him and asked, 'Is this one of your creations?' To which he replied, 'I got that photo from a fan of my site so I put it up. Never saw it before in my life. Looks real to me.'
  Here I should point out that while Juan Cabana is well known among aficionados of 'gaff art' (the construction of sideshow artifacts) and has even been publicly lauded for the quality of his work, he customarily pretends that the artifacts created by him were discovered, not made — it's the 'performance' aspect of his art, you might say. From time to time he does take credit for fabricating the objects, however, as when he appeared on George Noory's 'Coast to Coast' radio show, for example, to discuss his 'fantastic creations made from such elements as fish & animal remains, steel and fiberglass.' And what should appear next to Cabana's name on the 'Coast to Coast' website but a picture of the 'golden mermaid' herself.
  Not to beat a dead cryptozoid, but Cabana's protestations fly in the face not only of zoological science as we know it, but the laws of probability. He did, in fact, once claim to have found another mermaid carcass on Fort Desoto Beach, the selfsame locale where the 'golden mermaid' supposedly washed up.
  Even if mermaids did exist — which, I'm sorry, Virginia, they do not — the odds against that happenstance are beyond astronomical, as Mr. Cabana himself ought to — but would probably not — admit.

"Does a Work Moose in a Harness Exist?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalkingdom/fl/Does-a-Work-Moose-in-a-Harness-Exist.htm","2016-08-16 20:57:26","  By David Emery
  Netlore Archive: In this viral image circulating since February 2007, we see a full-grown, domesticated 'work moose' supposedly being harnessed to haul wood in a logging operation. This image was determined to be fake.
  The image is a fake, as are the various captions and stories accompanying it on its email rounds since early February 2007. One version says the photo was taken in Wyoming. Another says it was taken on St. Joseph Island in Lake Huron, Canada. Yet another claims it was taken in Maine. In truth, the picture is a composite, different parts of which could have been taken anywhere in the world.
  A peek at its EXIF data reveals that the original photograph (presumably of the woodsy background) was taken with a Kodak digital camera on September 10, 2006, and edited in Adobe Photoshop on December 12, 2006. Let's examine it more closely.
  
  The gentleman who appears to be harnessing the moose is wearing a blue jacket emblazoned with an illustration of a horse-drawn carriage and a logo that includes the words 'Chevaux d'Abitibi' ('Horses of Abitibi').
  From these, it seems reasonable to postulate that: 1) this element of the image was cut and pasted from a photo taken in the Abitibi region of Quebec, Canada, and 2) In that original photograph the subject was harnessing (or perhaps shoeing) a horse, not a moose.
  Overall, the mystery Photoshopper did a pretty convincing job of creating the impression that the moose is actually wearing a harness, though the type of rig shown isn't too fancy for hauling logs. Note the telltale dark outline (or shadow) around the bit of strap curling down below the moose's midsection. Note, too, that when the contrast is softened on the portion of the image around the man's right hand (see detail #2), he appears to be holding a six-inch length of strap attached to... nothing!
  Lastly, note the matching woodpiles -- they are mirror images, actually -- in the lower right and left-hand corners of the photo. Nice trick and barely noticeable on first glance, but it's a clear example of the kind of photo fakery that went into the construction of this image.
  Internet hoax aside, domesticated moose do exist and have served as work animals wherever their numbers were plentiful throughout history, as can be seen in these historical photographs:
  Here's an email contributed by Bonnie D. on Feb. 8, 2007:
  Subject: Fw: Logging Here is something you don't see everyday. Logging, St Joseph Island Style.
  Sample email (with identical image) contributed by Carol B. on Feb. 11, 2007:
  Subject: Work Moose Greetings, I received multiple emails looking for copies of, and sources for, the photo of the moose logging. The info below is forwarded from: Lew R. McCreery US Forest Service Northeastern Area Morgantown, WV 26505 According to Lew, this letter is from Pete Lammert with the Maine Forest Service. Thanks for sending it along, Lew!
  Moose logging story The man in the picture is Jacques Leroux who lives up near Escourt Station and has always had work horses, first for actual work and then for show at Maine's' many summer fairs. I think he had two matched pairs, one Clydesdales and the other Belgiums. He would turn them out to pasture each morning and then work them in the afternoon dragging the sled around the fields. Three springs ago, he noticed a female moose coming to the pasture and helping herself of the hay and what grain the work horses didn't pick up off the ground. Jacques said he could get within 10 feet of the moose before it would turn and move off. Two springs ago, the moose foaled (?)at the edge of the work horse pasture and upon getting to it's feet had not only the mother in attendance but the four horses. The young moose grew up around the horses and each afternoon when Mr. Leroux took the teams for their daily exercise, the yearling moose would trail along the entire route next to the near horse. At some point, the yearling got so accustomed to Mr. Leroux that, after he had brushed each horse after a workout, he started brushing down the moose. The moose tolerated this quite well so Mr. Leroux started draping harness parts over the yearling to see how he would tolerate these objects. The yearling was soon harness broken and now came the question of what could you do with a harness broke moose. As you may or may not know, a great deal of Maine is being bought up by folks 'from away' and some of them understand principles of forest management. The folks buying small parcels of land up in the area of the Allagash have it in their mind that they don't want big skidders and processors and forwarders on their small wood lots. Enter Mr. Leroux with his teams of horses. Every morning, when Mr.. Leroux loaded the teams into the horse trailer to go off to the days job, the yearling moose got quite riled up and one day loaded himself right into the trailer with the horses. At the job site, Jacques unloaded the horses and as the moose stayed right with them, he would take the Clydesdales and his brother Gaston would take the Belgians and off into the woods they would go with the moose trailing behind. They would put the harness on the moose in case they encountered someone who they could kid with the explanation that the moose was a spare in case something happened to one of the horses. The work required them to skid cut, limbed and topped stems to the landing where the stems could be loaded onto a truck for the pulp mill. All morning long the two brothers brought out twitch after twitch of stems with the moose following the Belgian team for the most part. During the lunch break Jacques had the bright idea of putting trace chains and a whiffle tree on the moose's harness and all afternoon the moose went back and forth following the Belgians in and out of the woods dragging his whiffletree along the ground. As there were no stumps in the skid trail, the whiffle tree never hung up on anything and that first day in harness went great. So next day, they hitched on first a small stem and the moose brought it out just fine following the Belgians. Mr. Leroux told me they were up to four small stems now and the moose was doing just great. He cautioned however that there were a few problems with using a bull moose. Come June, when the new antlers start, the new bone is 'in velvet' and must itch like crazy as the moose stops every once in awhile and rubs his rack against just about anything to appease the itch. Once, before the brothers learned to tie him of by himself while they had lunch, the moose was rubbing his antlers against the hame on the Clydesdale called Jack and got it wedged there for a bit. Jacques said he wished he had a camera as it looked like moose was trying to push Jack over. The other problem is the rutting season. The brothers learned quickly to leave moose in the barn as he was constantly on red alert in the woods during this time. The brothers are also considering trying this with two females to make a matched pair which would become an instant hit at the Maine Fairs. The trouble with the bulls is their racks. They would be constantly rubbing and hitting each other and yes they would have to be gelded as I just couldn't imagine getting the two bulls anywhere near each other, let alone in harness. Thought you should know the rest of the story. If any of you doubt this, please contact Tom Whitworth in Ashland, Maine. I think he said was a second cousin to the Lerouxs and has seen this anomaly many times.

  Analysis: True. On October 5, 2004, electric workers were stringing power cable along a stretch of Pogo Mine Road 80 miles southeast of Fairbanks when, unbeknownst to them, a 1,200-pound bull moose became entangled in the cable and was hoisted 50 feet off the ground when the line was winched to the top of the utility poles. This being real life and not an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle , the incident probably sounds more amusing than it was. The moose was still alive when the workers found it, photographed it, and finally lowered it to the ground, but their efforts to disentangle it were thwarted by the critter's own panicked attempts to flee. In the end, after consulting with the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game, power company officials decided to put the moose out of its misery. The meat, we're told, was salvaged and donated to a local resident.

"Is This a West Virginia Mountain Lion?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/animalkingdom/ss/West-Virginia-Mountain-Lion.htm","2016-04-25 05:39:12","  Viral images show an unusually large mountain lion (cougar) purportedly killed near Parkersburg, West Virginia (or elsewhere, such as Altoona, Pennsylvania, Cadiz, Kentucky, and other unlikely locations).
  Description: Viral images Circulating since: February 2008 Status: Mislabeled
  Example: Email contributed by Tina P., March 3, 2008:
  Subject: Massive Mountain Lion (near parkersburg, wv) This lion was hit between Grantsville and Walker WV.. by a car. Game and Fish had to come and put him down. He charged at the Fish and Game guy in the process. Look at his PAWS!
  Analysis: As so often happens with viral images, the preceding photos — which are authentic and date from December 2007 — have attained urban legend status thanks to folks making up stories about them before sharing them with others.
  Here's a version that was forwarded to me in May 2009:
  Cougar bagged Near Beaumont, Texas
  Look at what James Snipe hit with his car on county road 421 north of Beaumont Texas in Jefferson County. The lion was still alive but unable to move, so our neighbor called animal control and they came and put him down. A land owner had seen this one a week before dragging off a 320 lb steer. Our neighbor is an amateur taxidermist and he's going to stuff him.  This one weighed 260 lbs. while most mature male mountain lions weigh 80 to 150 lbs. We had no idea they still roamed around here!
  So, was the mountain lion killed in West Virginia or Texas? The answer is neither.
  The true facts are these. The cougar in question, estimated at 200 to 220 pounds and over 7 feet in length, was run over when it leaped in front of a pickup truck driven by Arizona resident Marshall Rader on Highway 64 between Williams and Valle, Arizona.
  The big cat was still alive but mortally injured when Rader and his wife got out to examine it, so they dialed 911 and waited for someone from the Arizona Department of Public Safety to arrive and put it down. The man posing with the carcass is DPS officer Jason Ellico, who dispatched the animal on the scene and later skinned it as a demonstration for local Boy Scouts.
  Someone — presumably Mr. or Mrs. Rader, though we don't know for sure — emailed the pictures to friends, who emailed them to more friends, and on and on until an urban legend was born . Among the first fabrications appended to the photos was the claim that the accident had occurred in a different part of Arizona — between Prescott and Ash Fork, to be exact, roughly 60 miles or so from the true location.
  By early March 2008, the story had changed yet again such that the cougar was said to have been killed southeast of Parkersburg, West Virginia between Grantsville and Walker. West Virginia game officials were quick to label that version of the message a hoax, noting that the accident had also been falsely reported to have occurred in Arkansas. As time went on, there were versions claiming the cougar was shot near Altoona, Pennsylvania, Cadiz, Kentucky, and other unlikely locations.
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service has concluded that the eastern cougar (aka eastern puma), a subspecies that once roamed northeastern North America, is now extinct. Nonetheless, there have been occasional unconfirmed reports of cougar sightings in states such as West Virginia in recent years, leading biologists to theorize that a few western cougars may have migrated east.
  A series of photos showing a mountain lion creeping around someone's porch in Wyoming met a similar fate as these images, circulating under the pretense of being taken in Michigan, Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere.

I have not spoken to Dan in a while, but he has terrible predator problems. Some of you may have been copied 4 years ago on the wolves that attacked his boys and their camp at night as well as bears.

  A couple from Montana were out riding on the range, he with his rifle and she (fortunately) with her camera. Their dogs always followed them, but on this occasion a Mountain Lion decided that he wanted to stalk the dogs (you'll see the dogs in the background watching). Very, very bad decision...
  The hunter got off the mule with his rifle and decided to shoot in the air to scare away the lion, but before he could get off a shot the lion charged in and decided he wanted a piece of those dogs. With that, the mule took off and decided he wanted a piece of that lion. That's when all hell broke loose... for the lion.
  As the lion approached the dogs the mule snatched him up by the tail and started whirling him around. Banging its head on the ground on every pass. Then he dropped it, stomped on it and held it to the ground by the throat. The mule then got down on his knees and bit the thing all over a couple of dozen times to make sure it was dead, than whipped it into the air again, walked back over to the couple (that were stunned in silence) and stood there ready to continue his ride... as if nothing had just happened.

"'Mermaid Is Real' Video Is Actually Fake — But You Knew That, Right?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/mythicalcreatures/fl/Mermaid-Is-Real-Video.htm","2016-06-05 15:23:07","  By David Emery
  Yet another viral video is making the rounds purporting to show the body of a 'real mermaid' washed up on a beach somewhere (some versions claim it was in India), but this latest of many attempts to convince the gullible that mermaids exist is no more credible than previous examples we've seen.
  Description: Viral video / Hoax Circulating since: August 2014 Status: Fake
  In reality, the video consists of a montage of still photos of a prop mermaid created by makeup and special effects artist Joel Harlow for the 2011 film Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . They don't come any faker than that.
  A similar video uploaded to YouTube in 2009 shows a 'dead mermaid' supposedly found on a Florida beach. It, too, was fabricated, in this case by taxidermy artist Juan Cabana (a clearer version of the video was later posted by the artist). Cabana is also responsible for viral images of a dead 'merman' allegedly found in Fort Desoto Beach, Florida (and elsewhere), and a ' mermaid carcass ' said to have been discovered in the Philippines (and elsewhere).
  continue reading below our video
  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Cabana's work partakes of a centuries-old tradition of mermaid fakery exemplified by P. T. Barnum's 19th-century ' Feejee Mermaid ' hoax and Japanese ' mummified mermaids ' dating back to the 1600s.
  With the advent of computerized special effects (CGI), the art of mermaid fakery now extends to 'living' specimens as well as dead ones. Animal Planet's 2012 faux documentary Mermaids: The Body Found proceeds on the premise that these mythical, half-fish, half-human creatures really do exist and offers ' actual footage ' of living, breathing mermaids. I've encountered more than a few viewers who refuse to believe that the footage was computer-generated and the documentary a work of fiction. Immediately after the show first aired, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tried to counter public confusion by issuing a statement saying that no evidence of 'aquatic humanoids' has ever been found. They may have convinced some, but certainly not all. In my own informal reader poll nearly half of respondents say they believe mermaids are real.
  What millennium is this again?
  Water spirits are universal in world mythology and more often than not have been depicted as half human, half fish — and female. Aboriginal Australians refer to them as yawkyawks. African mermaid lore centers around a figure called Mami Wata , known in Caribbean cultures as Lasirn. Brazil has its Igpupiara . There are Japanese legends about a water-dwelling spirit called Ningyo (literally, 'human fish'), and in Greek and Roman mythology the sea was populated with mermaid-like goddesses called Neiredes (sea nymphs). While the Greeks often pictured them as maidens swimming on the backs of dolphins or other sea creatures, Roman depictions of them more closely resemble our own. 'And for the Meremaids called Nereides,' wrote Pliny the Elder in the 8th century AD, 'it is no fabulous tale that goeth of them: for looke how painters draw them, so they are indeed: only their bodie is rough and skaled all over, even in those parts wherin they resemble a woman.'
  Note that at the same time Pliny evinced a belief in mermaids, he also felt it necessary to insist that 'it is no fabulous tale that goeth of them,' which suggests there must have been mermaid skeptics even in his day. It makes me wonder whether Pliny really did think mermaids existed, or whether, like the Internet hoaxers of today, he was intentionally pulling his readers' legs.
  I suppose we'll never know.

Car buyers take delivery of their purchases via a fully automated procedure whereby the automobile is plucked robotically from a cubbyhole in one of the two 'twin towers,' each of which holds up to 400 vehicles, and brought to its owner on a special elevator.

"Is Islam Based on Peace, Submission, and Surrender to God?","http://atheism.about.com/od/islammuslims/fl/Is-Islam-Based-on-Peace-Submission-and-Surrender-to-God.htm","2016-03-17 14:20:28","  By Austin Cline
  Islam isn't just a title or name of a religion, it's also a word in Arabic which is rich in meaning and has many connections to other fundamental Islamic concepts. Understanding the concept of 'Islam,' or 'submission,' is critical to understanding the religion which derives its name from it — not only can it make critiques of Islam better informed, but there are in fact good reasons to critique and question Islam on the basis of the concept of submission to an authoritarian god .
  
  The Arabic term 'islam means 'submission' and itself comes from the term 'aslama , which means 'to surrender, resign oneself.' In Islam, the fundamental duty of each Muslim is to submit to Allah (Arabic for 'the God') and whatever Allah wants of them. A person who follows Islam is called a Muslim, and this means 'one who surrenders to God.' It is thus clear that the concept of submission to the will, desires, and commands and God is inextricably linked to Islam as a religion — it's an inherent part of the name of the religion, of the religion's followers, and of the basic tenets of Islam .
  When a religion originally develops in a cultural context where total submission to absolute rulers and total submission to the head of a family are taken for granted, it's hardly surprising that this religion would reinforce these cultural values and add on top of them the idea of total submission to a god which stands above all those other authority figures. In modern society where we have learned the importance of equality, universal suffrage, personal autonomy, and democracy, though, such values seem out of place and should be challenged.
  Why is it good or appropriate to 'submit' to a god? Even if we assume that some god exists, it cannot automatically follow that humans have any sort of moral obligation to completely submit or surrender to the will of this god. It certainly can't be argued that the sheer power of such a god creates such an obligation — it might be prudent to submit to a more powerful being, but prudence is not something that can be described as a moral obligation. On the contrary, if humans have to submit or surrender to such a god out of fear of the consequences, it merely reinforces the idea that this god is itself unethical.
  We must also remember the fact that since no gods appear before us to deliver instructions, submission to any 'god' entails on a practical level submission to this god's self-appointed representatives as well as whatever traditions and regulations they create. Many criticize the totalitarian nature of Islam because it seeks to be an all-encompassing ideology which controls every aspect of life: ethics, manners, laws, etc.
  For some atheists , rejection of belief in gods is closely connected with believing that we need to reject all totalitarian rulers as part of the development of human freedom. Mikhail Bakunin, for example, wrote that 'the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice' and that 'if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him.'
  Other religions also teach that the most important value or behavior for believers is to submit to whatever that religion's god wants, and the same criticisms can be made of them. Usually this principle of submission is only made explicit by conservative and fundamentalist believers, but while more liberal and moderate believers may downplay the importance of this principle, none go so far as to teach that it's legitimate to disobey or ignore their god.
  
  The Arabic word islam is related to the Syriac 'aslem which means 'to make peace, surrender' and that in turn appears to be derived from the Semitic stem of *slem which means 'to be complete.' The Arabic word islam is thus also closely related to the Arabic word for peace, salem . Muslims believe that true peace can only be achieved through true obedience to the will of Allah.
  Critics and observers must not forget, though, that 'peace' here is inextricably intertwined with 'submission' and 'surrender' — specifically to the will, desires, and commands of Allah, but of course also to those who set themselves up as the transmitters, interpreters, and teachers in Islam. Peace is thus not something achieved through mutual respect, compromise, love, or anything similar. Peace is something that exists as a consequence of and in the context of submission or surrender.
  This is not a problem limited solely to Islam. Arabic is a Semitic language and Hebrew, also Semitic, creates the same connections between peace or 'shalom' and submission in the Bible :
  'When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of peace. If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people in it shall serve you at forced labor.' ( Deuteronomy 20:10-11)
  It makes sense that 'peace' would involve domination in these contexts because God isn't likely to be willing to negotiate and compromise with enemies — but that's what is necessary for there to be a peace based upon mutual respect and equal freedom. The god of the ancient Israelites and of Muslims is an absolutist, totalitarian god with no interest in compromises, negotiations, or dissent. For such a god, the only peace that's needed is a peace achieved through the subjugation of those who oppose him.
  Commitment to Islam is supposed to result in a constant struggle to achieve peace, justice and equality. Many atheists would agree with Bakunin's argument, though, that 'if God is, he is necessarily the eternal, supreme, absolute master, and, if such a master exists, man is a slave; now, if he is a slave, neither justice, nor equality, nor fraternity, nor prosperity are possible for him.' The Muslim conception of god can thus be described as an absolute tyrant, and Islam itself can be described as an ideology designed to teach people to become submissive towards all would-be rulers, from Allah on down.

"The Nareepol Tree / Narilatha Flower","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/naturalwonders/fl/The-Nareepol-Tree-Narilatha-Flower.htm","2016-02-18 13:40:51","  By David Emery
  Among the myriad interesting 'facts' one learns browsing Facebook is that there exists a plant in Asia which blooms only once every 20 years, supposedly, and whose flower is shaped precisely like the nude torso of a woman (see photo).
  Some say it grows in Thailand and is called the 'Nareepol tree.' Others say it's native to the Himalayas, where it's called a 'Narilatha flower' (alternative spelling: 'Naarilatha flower'). In Sri Lanka they supposedly call it a 'Liyathambara Mala.'
  But what's in a name? The point is, so completely alluring are the 'lady-shaped blossoms' of this tree or plant, supposedly, that the blissful trances of hermits and sages have been known to be 'shattered' at the sight of them.
  We are skeptical.

  Example #1:
  Fw: Believe it or Not - Pokok berbuahkan perempuan - Harun
  This is amazing tree named 'Nareepol' in Thai. Naree means 'girl/woman' and pol means plant/tree or 'buah' in Malay. It means women tree. It is amazing what God create the World in many forms that amused human beings.... You can see the real tree at Petchaboon province about almost 500 kms away from Bangkok.

  Example #2:
  It is called the Narilatha flower, which when translated in Hindi means flower in the shape of a lady. It is also called the Liyathambara Mala in local Sri Lankan dialect. The tree is also said to be found in Thailand where it is allegedly called 'Nareepol.'
  The Narilatha flowering plant is said to grow in the hilly slopes of Himalayas in India and is understood to bloom once in two decades only; in other words it blossoms into a lady like flower after a 20-year interval. It is believed that in times of yore the concentration of hermits and sages doing deep meditation would be shattered at the sight of these lady-shaped flowers.
  The Narilatha or Liyathambara flowers said to be in the shape of a women are considered one of the most wonderful and rarest of flowers in the world.
  Analysis: The image above is one of a set that has been floating around the Internet for many years. Strong arguments have already been made against the authenticity of these images.
  They're among a very few such photographs known to exist. for one thing. Surely, if the 'lady flowers' depicted in them were real, we would have more and better documentation than this. Instead, we find the same photos recirculated again and again.
  Secondly, an analysis on Google Trends shows that prior to April 2008, which is when these images first began circulating on the Internet, there were zero user inquiries pertaining to the phrase 'Nareepol tree.'
  Lastly, I mean, come on — do these 'flowers' look real to you? For my money, they were either fabricated and hung from tree branches to be photographed, or Photoshopped.
  Mind you, there does seem to be some actual basis in Buddhist mythology for the concept of flowers that resemble naked women. Supposedly the god Indra was afraid his wife would be attacked by lustful hermits, so he created a grove of magical trees bearing beautiful 'fruit maidens' — known in these sources as 'Nareephon,' 'Nariphon' or 'Makkaliporn' — to distract them. Remarkably — or maybe not, this being folklore — it worked.

  THAT FASHION models tend to be underweight and overly thin compared to the general populace and subject to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are criticisms frequently leveled at the fashion industry, and with good reason. At issue is not only the health and well-being of the models themselves, but that of ordinary women and girls constantly confronted with this impossible standard of beauty in the mainstream media.
  While the foregoing images hammer home that important point, they do so deceptively, however. Each photo has been digitally altered to exaggerate the models' emaciated appearance (for comparison, the original versions of several of the photos are available for viewing on Snopes.com). We don't know who manipulated the images (which have been circulating online since 2003), or for what purpose, but they're probably best interpreted as satire.
  The powers that be in the fashion industry have begun to get the point. In February 2011, the Council of Fashion Designers of America issued a statement pledging its commitment to 'healthier standards' for models.
  'Although models are key to effecting change, they obviously cannot do it alone,' wrote CFDA president Diane Von Furstenberg. 'Everyone in the fashion industry  designers, casting directors, agents, fashion-magazine editors, show producers  need to join forces. The bottom line is the importance of healthy, fit models whose well-being can in turn promote the development of positive body image and improved self-esteem in all girls and women.'

  Publication of the image prompted an investigation by the state prosecutor, who filed a complaint in July denouncing the two military police officers involved, Captain Bruno Schorcht and soldier D'Angelo de Matos Pinel, and demanding their immediate suspension for abuse of authority.
  Subsequent news reports stated that Captain Schorcht was 'punished' for his actions by being transferred to another battalion and promoted to the rank of Major, but according to O Globo columnist Ancelmo Gois, Schorcht's name was ' taken off the list ' for promotion after the state prosecutor's complaint was filed.

"The End of Social Security Paper Checks","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/federalbenefitprograms/a/No-More-Paper-Social-Security-Checks.htm","2016-06-04 11:08:55","  By Tom Murse
  The U.S. Department of Treasury began phasing out paper Social Security checks and other federal benefit checks on May 1, 2011. It required anyone applying for Social Security checks and other federal benefits on and after that date to receive their payments electronically.
  [ Applying for Social Security Benefits ]
  Those who began receiving Social Security checks before May of 2011 have until March 1, 2013, to sign up for electronic payments, the Treasury Department announced. Those who don't sign up to have their Social Security checks direct-deposited by that date would receive their benefits through the Direct Express card program .
  'Getting your Social Security or Supplemental Security Income payment by direct deposit or Direct Express is safer and more reliable,' Michael J. Astrue, the commissioner of Social Security, said in announcing the change.
  The change applied to Social Security, Supplemental Security Income , Veterans Affairs benefits , and anyone who receives benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board , Office of Personnel Management and Department of Labor (Black Lung) .
  'You don't have to worry about your check being lost or stolen and your money is available immediately on your payment date,' Astrue said. 'There is no need to wait for the mail to arrive.'
  In 2010, more than 540,000 Social Security and Supplemental Security Income paper checks were reported lost or stolen and had to be replaced, the Treasury Department said.
  Phasing out paper Social Security checks entirely is expected to save taxpayers about $120 million every year, or more than $1 billion over 10 years. Government officials also pointed out that eliminating paper Social Security checks will 'provide positive benefits to the environment, saving 12 million pounds of paper in the first five years alone.'
  'More than 18 million baby boomers are expected to reach retirement age during the next five years, with 10,000 people a day becoming eligible for Social Security benefits,' said Treasurer Rosie Rios.
  'It costs 92 cents more to issue a payment by paper check than by direct deposit. We are retiring the Social Security paper check option in favor of electronic payments because it is the right thing to do for benefit recipients and American taxpayers alike.'
  If you are applying for new benefits , you are now required to choose an electronic payment method, whether it's direct deposit of your Social Security check or other federal benefit into a bank or credit union account .
  When you apply for your Social Security check or other federal benefit, you will need:
  You can also choose to receive your Social Security check on a prepaid debit card or Direct Express Debit MasterCard card.
  If you currently get your Social Security check or other federal benefit payment on paper, you must switch to electronic payments before March 1, 2013.
  You can switch from paper checks to direct deposit at www.GoDirect.org , by calling the U.S. Treasury Electronic Payment Solution Center's toll-free helpline at (800) 333-1795, or by speaking with a bank or credit union representative.
  Anyone already receiving federal benefit payments electronically will continue to receive their money as usual on their payment day. No action is required.
  The first monthly Social Security check was received by Ida Mae Fuller on Jan. 31, 1940, according to the Treasury Department. Since then about 165 million people have received Social Security benefits.
  The movement toward electronic payments has been steadily increasing, the Treasury Department said. By May of 2011, electronic payments made up more than three-quarters of all noncash payments nationwide.
  There were 5.7 billion fewer checks written in 2009 than in 2006, a decline of 6.1 percent per year - while electronic payments grew 9.3 percent during that same period. Among federal benefit recipients, about eight in 10 receive their Social Security check or other federal benefit payment electronically, according to the Treasury Department .

  Glad we put in the electric fence. At least we discovered what has been happening to all the dogs.
  Thought you might like to see what's been eating them.
  Have a good weekend.

  Thought everyone might be interested in these photos of a snake caught on an electric fence on a sheep & cattle station near the NSW town of Nyngan....
  Some tourists on holidays came across the snake caught in an electric fence, being continually shocked, and getting very angry!
  The group wondering what to do, decided to divert the current, cut the wire AND let the snake go! (Thinking this was the humane thing to do).
  When the property owner found out he went ballistic, besides being upset about his fence, the snake had been eating lambs in the area, and he'd been trying to track it for ages. He did not appreciate the help ! Australians are used to a big snake or two, but wait till you see this old fella !

  This is scary!!!
  An Australian sheep farmer was puzzled at the disappearance of sheep on his farm. After a few weeks of sheep disappearing the farmer decided to put up electric fence. This is what he found!..........
  Analysis: Of the seven different captions that have accompanied the preceding images on their email rounds since July 2005, only one correctly identifies their place of origin: a game farm in South Africa. To be specific, the snapshots were taken at the Silent Valley Game Ranch in the Limpopo Province.
  The various stories people have told in forwarded emails containing the photos are a good illustration of how folklore works -- in the absence of facts, people make up something that sounds good. And other people hear it or read it, believe it, and pass it along. And you wondered why urban legends exist?
  As stated on the ranch's website, the snake in the photos is four-meter-long rock python ( Python sebae ) which, shortly before its death, had swallowed not a sheep, nor a dog, but a full-grown female impala, making its body too fat to squeeze under the electric fence without touching it.

"Home Security Signs","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/ss/welcome_to_kenya_sign.htm","2016-01-24 08:48:30","  By David Beaudrie
  You’ve undoubtedly driven by a house before that had a big sign in the front yard stating there is a security system there. However, despite what the sign said, there may or may not be an actual security system in place. Security systems work as a deterrent when a potential intruder knows that there is one present. This is why most systems include one or more signs as part of their package. Some people utilize security signs even when they don’t have a system as a way of keeping intruders at bay for less money than a security system entails. There are advantages and disadvantages to doing this.
  It is in a thief’s best interests to pick the easiest targets possible. Houses with security systems are typically not worth the trouble for house thieves unless there is something specific in the house they are targeting that makes the house worth the risk. Placing a sign in your front lawn or by your front door advertising a home security system will usually make an intruder think twice about trespassing onto your property.
  continue reading below our video
  How to Make a Space Feel Brighter
  Security systems often cost hundreds of dollars, while a quality sign could run you less than five dollars.
  Relying on a sign as your main source of home protection is a risky proposition. The sign is only effective if a potential home intruder believes it is genuine. Some companies sell fake home security signs, and the signs are often recognized by experienced burglars. Therefore, security signs that advertise generic systems and lack a brand identity are more likely to be perceived as fake. Once that happens, the sign is useless.
  While a security sign does work as a deterrent, it also alerts a thief that a system is present if he decides to go through with the break-in anyway. This means he is less likely to be caught by surprise by an alarm activating. If a thief is familiar with particular types of security systems , the sign lets him know what he can expect once he tries entering the home.
  If you have an actual home security system, get signs from that security company. The sign should have the brand name and logo of the security company on it. Ideally, the company’s reputation helps keep potential burglars away from your home. Some companies provide you with multiple signs to put around the perimeter of your house. Make sure you have one posted by your front door, and at any other major entrance into the house. If you want signs that are more subtle, tape a smaller home security symbol in the window closest to your front door. However, the sign is not a deterrent if it is too hard to see.
  If you are using a sign when you don’t have an actual security system, choose your sign carefully. Generic signs are often easy to spot. See if any local security companies will actually sell you a sign. This is unlikely if you are not actually buying a security system, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Your sign placement remains the same. Make sure the signs are well-lit at night so that they are easily seen from a distance.
  Security signs are an effective deterrent, but they work better when they are part of a comprehensive home security plan . If you are relying on a sign without a system to back it up, it is even more imperative that you have effective exterior lighting and are diligent about locking all your doors and windows. No security system is a replacement for good habits. However, a security system can protect you from the occasional mistake, such as accidentally leaving a door unlocked. A security sign does not afford you that luxury.

"Dressing Up as Someone of a Different Race for Halloween","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fashion/ss/Sexy-Ebola-Nurse-Costume.htm","2016-09-30 14:10:21","  By Nadra Kareem Nittle
  Hell used to be biggest the inspiration for Halloween costumes . But these days dressing up as a ghost, goblin or zombie is unlikely to win a Halloween reveler many kudos. That’s because popular culture has replaced the underworld as the most influential source of Halloween costumes. With people of color more prominent in pop culture than ever before, some costume lovers face a dilemma: Is it all right to dress up as someone of a different race for Halloween?
  The answer to that question depends on the costume you’ve chosen and your presentation of it, not to mention the person you’ve decided to duplicate for the occasion. Following the tips below will lower the odds that you’ll make a racial gaffe if you dress up as a person of another race for Halloween.
  Under no circumstances is it okay to dress up as a Mexican, black guy or Asian dude for Halloween. A racial group does not make for an appropriate costume, and any desire to dress up as a generic minority for Halloween is a pretty good indicator that you’ve bought into stereotypes about the group in question.
  To raise awareness about this issue, Ohio University group Students Teaching About Racism in Society launched a campaign called 'We're a culture, not a costume.'
  Instead of dressing up as a generic racial group for Halloween, choose a particular individual to dress up as, preferably one who’s known for suiting up in certain ensembles. Golfer Tiger Woods often wears red polo shirts and black pants while competing. Throw on such an outfit and walk around with a golf club in hand, and many people will pick up on the fact that you’re Mr. Woods for Halloween. Suiting up as any athlete who wears a jersey is one way to be easily identifiable. Most basketball fans know that Steph Curry is No. 30.
  Of course, your costume needn’t be relegated to the sports world. With his trademark sequined glove and red leather jacket, Michael Jackson is an instantly recognizable costume.
  Avoid blackface like the plague when dressing up as a person of a different race for Halloween. Recognize that many African Americans consider blackface to be as offensive as the N-word. If you’re choosing to go as a minority celebrity who wears attire that’s recognizable to the masses, there’s no need to darken your skin.
  The same goes for taping your eyes back to appear Asian . Instead, choose to go as a highly recognizable Asian figure for Halloween, such as buddy team Harold and Kumar in their orange jumpsuits from the “Guantanamo Bay” film or the Japanese schoolgirl Gogo Yubari, who handled a meteor hammer in “Kill Bill.”
  On Halloween, you should also reconsider throwing on an Afro wig. While natural hair has made a comeback in the black community, most African Americans today don’t sport 1970s style Afros, so unless you’re dressing up as Dolemite or another blaxploitation hero from that era, you should question the need to rock a faux Afro for Halloween. On the other hand, if your costume for Halloween is Bob Marley , you’re a lot less likely to offend people by donning a dreadlock wig, as locks were a staple of his look. But even in this case, it's wise to exercise caution. Some people may still view such wigs as a mockery of natural black hairstyles.
  You can avoid making many of the racial gaffes that befall Halloween celebrants by simply wearing a mask. A mask will remove any temptation to use blackface, tape back your eyes or make similar racially offensive moves. A variety of manufacturers offer masks of President Barack Obama, Michael Jackson and other famous people of color.
  Some costumes are just asking for trouble. Avoid politically incorrect costumes that fuel racial stereotypes . People of color aren’t likely to appreciate a white person dressing up as Aunt Jemima , a Muslim terrorist or an “illegal alien.” Question your motivation for wanting to wear a Halloween costume that’s likely to be regarded as racist. It may seem like a funny idea to you but will feel like a slap in the face to the communities mocked by the costume.

  Subject: Fwd: Warning to plant lovers
  It could happen anywhere............
  I almost had a heart attack this week. My son got me a potted plant for my birthday kept it on my kitchen counter the whole time and this week it was warm enough to plant outside so I took it out to plant tried to get it out of pot with no luck so I wet it really good and the plant came out it was in a decorative glass container with no holes in it and had another pot cut and wedged into the glass pot so after i planted the flower I got a knife to get the plastic pot from the glass one had to wedge a knife around the sides to get it out when I did this something moved I told Ron it looked like a snake, so I called my son out he took the liner out to our surprise low and behold not one snake but two baby copper heads.
  I almost died been upset since then. when we took the plastic pot from the glass one there was a piece of card board up the side of we think that there must have been eggs in the holes of the card board at the growers and when it got hot they must have hatched out. .
  I am sending you pictures. take my advise don't bring plants inside. this could have been really - really bad . This plant was bought at the grocery store. I will not give the name of the store I don't want to ruin there business but will tell you if you ask just don't want to put the name on the news i'm sure it wasn't anything they knew about it's the grower that should be more careful in potting theses plants. I just want to warn you guys not to bring plants inside who know what could be leaking way down under those roots. I am only thankful it was not a plant to be kept inside
  
  
  The snakes pictured in the flower pot above appear to be harmless, garden-variety brown snakes . Still, no one likes finding a snake in their home , harmless or otherwise.
  I should note that there have been media reports over the past few years of people actually being bitten by poisonous snakes in the garden departments of home improvement stores. In April 2004, it happened to a man in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma . A few months later a woman was reportedly bitten by a rattlesnake in an Oro Valley, Arizona Home Depot store . So it's not a far stretch to imagine one of these critters being carried home in a potted plant.
  (A variant of this email states that the photos were taken in Columbus, Mississippi, but we have no way of verifying the accuracy of that claim.)
  More slithery tales:
  The Snake in the House If you think those little green garden snakes are totally harmless, you have another think coming!
  The Snake in the Store 'The woman was shopping for coats at K-Mart and when she put her hand in one of the pockets she felt a sharp prick and noticed blood on her finger...'

  Snake... THIS IS FOR REAL!!
  A CREW MEMBER ON A LAND OIL RIG IN AMAZONAS WENT OUT AND TOOK A NAP. YES, A NAP. HE WAS MISSING AND THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND.

  Example #2: Forwarded email contributed by a reader in January 2001:
  Subject: : Read this before Camping...... in Singapore
  This is scary.
  Ok, this is unbelievable. The story goes that 3 military guys in Singapore were spending the night in the jungle. When they bedded down at night there were 3 of them, when they awoke in the morning there were only 2. The 2 remaining men did not hear or see what happened to their partner during the night. The following photos show a python. They found it nearby. It was having trouble moving...
  Before jumping to the conclusion that whoever captioned the preceding images knew what they were talking about, consider that what you have just read is only one of many variants of the tale in circulation. Each gives a slightly different rundown of events.
  There's another version, otherwise identical to the first, which claims that the incident happened in Venezuela, not Brazil. Still another says it occurred in Nouakchott, Mauritania.
  And another specifies the locale as the Philippines.
  The victim's identity is as variable as the setting. Sometimes the person allegedly swallowed by the snake is described as an oil worker, sometimes as a hunter, sometimes a camper and, in at least one case, a child:
  Apparently, three boys were sleeping in the jungle in South America when the other two woke up, one was missing and a huge snake was laying next to them. You'll see the snake in the first two photo's with the boy inside and the third one is when they cut the snake open to reveal the boy.
  The variant below, contributed by a reader in March 2001, claims it 'really happened' to a hunter camped out in the Brazilian rain forest:
  Unbelievable but true
  Just remember .... things could always be worse.
  Be careful when you go camping.
  This really happened In Brazil...Three Locals went hunting in the forest and did the usual during the day, they went to sleep. When they woke up the next morning, one of the guys was missing...
  The other two searched for their missing friend and when they ran across this anaconda with a huge lump..... well they caught the anaconda and took it to town since they feared that their friend was the victim. Surprise: it was!
  He was swallowed in one piece by a 17 FT anaconda. That's not a way anyone wants to go.
  Or it could have really happened to this camper in Palo Duro Canyon, Texas -- a part of the world where, as we all know, everything is larger than life...
  THE STORY IS THESE TWO GUYS WERE CAMPING IN PALO DURO CANYON OR SOUTH AMERICA, MAYBE. ONE OF THE GUYS WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HIS BUDDY WAS GONE. HE SENT FOR HELP TO FIND HIM, THEY FOUND THIS SNAKE INSTEAD. PICTURES 1&2 ARE OF THE SNAKE WHEN THEY CAUGHT IT. AND 3 IS WHAT THEY FOUND WHEN THEY CUT THE SNAKE OPEN, THE MISSING BUDDY!!
  A more detailed account of what's supposedly happening in these photographs comes to us via the Weekly World News , a now-defunct U.S. tabloid newspaper renowned for such earth-shattering scoops as ' Ape Gives Birth to Human Baby ' and 'JFK Was Shot to Prevent Him From Revealing Truth About UFOs.'
  According to an article in the July 25, 2000 issue of WWN , the victim was actually Pakistani tourist Amjar Bukhari, who was swallowed by a boa constrictor and spent '12 to 15 horrifying minutes trapped in the serpent's belly before workers at Nairobi National Park [Kenya] sliced open the enormous snake and rescued him.' 'We sliced open the snake's belly and a pair of human legs tumbled out,' one of the rescuers is quoted as saying. 'At first we thought the man was dead — then I saw his foot twitch and we quickly hauled him out.' The story says Bukhari survived, believe it or not, with a couple of fractured ribs and 'minor burns from the snake's stomach acid.' Truth be told, the Weekly World News version of events is no more credible than the narratives circulating online. Historically, the paper's editors exhibited a great fondness for snake-eats-human stories with no evident interest in their veracity. WWN published two such items during the early 1990s, each illustrated with an identical World War II-vintage photograph of a python bulging with freshly consumed prey — and each telling a completely different story. One claimed the victim was a Japanese scientist; the other stated that the snake had swallowed six human babies. What had really happened, as another, unpublished photograph from the same shoot revealed, was that the snake had recently fed upon a small deer.
  Totting up the claims of all these different sources, we have so far been told that the reptile in question is a python, a boa constrictor and an anaconda . Obviously, it can't be all three. My best guess after comparing the viral image with what I could find in reference books is that the snake is a python — not that that lends credibility to any particular version of events. All of these stories were plainly made up after the fact.
  No one seems to know where or when the photos were really taken, let alone who snapped the shutter. We don't even know if all of the snapshots came from the same camera. The first two match up with one another quite well, but the third and fourth are strikingly different in coloration and quality. It's hard to tell for sure if we're even looking at the same snake.
  Photos #3 and #4 could have easily been staged — i.e., snake is cut open, half-digested prey is discarded, man (or boy) crawls into the carcass, picture is taken. The poor quality of the images doesn't help.
  Do snakes ever swallow people whole? Maybe, maybe not. Pythons, boas and anacondas have been known on rare occasions to attack people — even to suffocate and kill them — but there's a dearth of documented cases wherein big snakes consumed human prey.
  Snake attacks, especially when the perpetrator is one of the larger specimens, almost always make headlines. Why have we seen nothing in the papers (apart from the Weekly World News , I mean) about the horrendous event supposedly depicted in these photos?
  I won't attempt to argue that no snake has ever swallowed a person, but it is surely a rare phenomenon. As to whether this well-traveled set of images constitutes proof, I can only venture an opinion: probably not.

  A round watermelon can take up a lot of room in a refrigerator and the usually round fruit often sits awkwardly on refrigerator shelves. Smart Japanese Farmers have forced their watermelons to grow into a square shape by inserting the melons into square, tempered glass cases while the fruit is still growing on the vine.
  Analysis: True. News stories about Japanese farmers growing square watermelons in tempered glass boxes began appearing in 2001, though the method had already been around for 20 years or so. Square watermelons have two distinct advantages over the traditional, oblong-shaped varieties, namely they're easier to store and easier to slice. Admiring customers were quoted as saying they couldn't afford the product, however, which sold at the time for at least twice what a normal watermelon would cost. The British supermarket chain Tesco announced in 2006 that it had developed its own version of the square watermelon which it expected to sell at a much more reasonable price. The product is also being grown experimentally in the U.S. For adventurous home gardeners, a recent issue of the Lansing State Journal featured instructions for growing your own square watermelons using rectangular cinder blocks as molds.

"Two Moons on August 27? Mars Spectacular Hoax","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/a/two-moons.htm","2017-01-06 00:14:49","  By David Emery
  Description: Viral text / Hoax Circulating since: 2003 Status: Outdated / False
  A recurring online rumor claims that Aug. 27 of a given year will bring 'the closest encounter between Mars and Earth in recorded history,' during which, supposedly, Mars will appear as large as the full moon and it will look like there are two moons in the night sky.
  It's nonsense. Mars is never close enough to earth to appear as large as the full moon, astronomers tell us . It's true that an event kinda-sorta similar to this occurred on August 27, 2003, as Mars was closer to the Earth than it had been for almost 60,000 years. NASA says it won't be that close again until the year 2287. However, there are recurring close approaches about every 26 months, and so the late August date won't be valid for most close approaches in your lifetime.
  During the Mars close approach on July 31, 2018, it will appear  arger than it did on the May 30, 2016, close approach. But with your naked eye it won't look much larger than normal.

  It will still be a bright, non-twinkling star, not a moon. With a telescope or strong binoculars, you will be able to see it is disc-shaped.
  FW: TWO MOONS MARK YOUR CALENDARS FOR THIS
  ** Two moon on 27 August ***
  27th Aug the Whole World is waiting for.............
  Planet Mars will be the brightest in the night sky Starting August.
  It will look as large as the full moon to the naked Eye. This will happen On Aug. 27 when Mars comes within 34.65M miles of earth. Be sure to watch The sky on Aug. 27 12:30 am. It will look like the earth has 2 moons. The Next time Mars may come this close is in 2287.
  Share this with your friends as NO ONE ALIVE TODAY Will ever see it again.
  12:30 Aug 27th you will see two moons in the sky, but only one will be the moon. The other will be Mars. It won't happen again until 2287. No one alive today has ever witnessed this happening.
  August 27th at 12:30 am u can see Mars and this isnt happening again until 2287.. need someone to watch this with
  You can't keep a good rumor down. These claims were semi-accurate when they first began circulating in the summer of 2003 . They were outdated by the time they went around again in 2005, however, and just plain false when they appeared in 2008 under the header 'Two Moons on August 27,' and yet again in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016, etc., as a PowerPoint slide show entitled 'Mars Spectacular.'
  How many times can a 'once in a lifetime' event occur? Well, just once. On Aug. 27, 2003, the oscillating orbits of Mars and Earth did, in fact, bring the two planets closer together than at any other time during the past 50,000 years. And although Mars never actually appeared 'as large as the full moon to the naked eye' — not even close (and not even possible) — it was indeed, for a rare few days in 2003, among the brightest objects in the night sky.
  In the July 31, 2018 event, Mars will still be 35.8 million miles away from Earth. In 2003 it was less than 35 million miles from Earth. Check the NASA Mars Close Approach page for coverage of upcoming close approaches. These can be a good excuse to buy a telescope and plan a vacation to a place with clear night skies.
  NASA plans its Mars missions to launch about every two years so they will arrive at Mars during one of these close approaches. By doing so, they save millions of miles of travel time.
  The orbits of the Earth, Mars, and other planets are not circular, they are oblong, and each orbits the sun in a different period of time. For Earth, that is 365 days (a year). Mars takes about 687 Earth days to circle the sun. Earth passes by Mars about once a year, but some years that is when Mars is farther away from the center of the solar system (the Sun) and other years it is when Mars is closer to the Sun, and therefore to the Earth.
  But, again, at no time is Mars so large that you would think it is another Moon.

  Fw: 'BIG' Texas Rattle Snake Next time you're out in the tall grass, remember this one. This snake was recently found at the J & S Quik Mart located just south of RR 3014 Turnoff on Highway 281 south of Tow, Texas. [That's just west of Burnett, Texas]
  9 feet, 1 inch - 97 lbs. A reminder that these creatures are actually out there and no matter what you believe, sometimes they should get not only prescriptive rights to be there, but the full right of way. And here's how to cook 'em ... DEEP-FRIED RATTLESNAKE 1 medium-sized rattlesnake (3-4 lbs.), cut into steaks 1/2 cup flour 1/4 cup cornmeal 1/4 cup cracker crumbs 1/2 cup milk 1 egg 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (not garlic salt) 1 teaspoon salt dash pepper Mix dry ingredients. Whisk milk into beaten egg and use to dip snake steaks. Then coat them with dry ingredients. Fry, uncovered, in 400 degree oil until brown. Yum,Yum!

  Analysis: Probably — no, surely — a bit of a tall tale. Another version of this same message circulating since 2005 claims the photo above was taken near Fritch, Texas. Yet another version, making the rounds since 2006, says it was taken near Devil's Lake, North Dakota.
  It's a forwarded email. People make this stuff up as they go.
  The reptile in question appears to be a western diamondback rattlesnake ( Crotalus atrox ), which is native to Texas (but not North Dakota) and is popularly known as the 'Texas rattler.' It's venomous and dangerous. You wouldn't want to try to pick one of these up unless it's dead.
  The image itself doesn't appear to have been manipulated, but perspective plays a giant role in the apparent size of the snake. Note how the specimen is being dangled on the edge of a rod. Note how much closer the snake is to the camera lens than the human subject. This causes its relative size to be exaggerated. Either that, or the human in the photo is very tiny little man. Perhaps it's both.
  Let's talk size. A normal snake of this type is usually around 4 feet long. Though the largest specimens of the western diamondback can grow to 6 or 7 feet in length, the size of this one has obviously been exaggerated at '9 feet, 1 inch.' (If true, it would have been the largest western diamondback rattlesnake ever documented.) Texas is full of giant snake stories .
  As to the recipe, I haven't tried it, but it looks to be a pretty good one. People do cook and eat rattlesnakes in some places. Usually the meat is floured or battered and deep-fried, as in the recipe above, but you can also bake it with rosemary and mushrooms if you prefer.
  The main thing to remember if you're cooking rattlesnake is to skin the dang thing first. Otherwise, you're likely to break a tooth.

"Why Is the Ocean Salty? Whale Sperm!","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fish/fl/Why-Is-the-Ocean-Salty-Whale-Sperm.htm","2016-06-01 14:05:38","  By David Emery
  According to this viral message, your typical blue whale produces more than 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, a factoid offered up to explain why the oceans are salty. In reality, even the largest whales only ejaculate up to a few gallons of semen at a time.
  Description: Email hoax / Joke Text circulating since: October 2002 Image circulating since: June 2003 Status: False (details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Duane G., June 17, 2003:
  OH MY GOD!!!!
  FW: Don't drink the sea water... read below first....
  The average blue whale produces over 400 gallons of sperm when it ejaculates, but only 10% of that actually makes it into his mate. So 360 gallons are spilled into the ocean every time one unloads, and you wonder why the ocean is so salty...
  Analysis: If you're looking for a scientific explanation of why the ocean is salty, click here . (Hint: It has nothing to do with whale sperm.)
  As to the viral message reproduced above, it's a two-part hoax, the text having first appeared as a ' Fact of the Day ' on email joke lists toward the end of 2002; the attached image is of unknown origin and didn't begin making the rounds until June 2003.

  It should be obvious at first glance that the text and image don't match. How could the relatively small aquatic specimen in the photo possibly produce 400 gallons of sperm at a go? By way of comparison, the capacity of an average hot tub is roughly that same amount, 400 gallons, meaning this poor creature would have to possess testicles twice the size of the rest of its body to live up to its glandular reputation.
  In point of fact, the animal in the photo probably isn't a blue whale — or any whale — at all (see below).
  Blue whales being the largest animals on the planet, it stands to reason that their reproductive organs ought to be of similarly impressive dimensions, and that is certainly the case. By one estimate, the penis of a blue whale can measure up to 16 feet long and its testicles weigh in at around 25 pounds apiece. But even packing 50 pounds of bollocks — the weight of an average-sized bulldog, if you need a benchmark — it's absurd to imagine that a blue whale (or any other creature on earth, for that matter) could produce 400 gallons of seminal fluid at a time, or even one-tenth that amount.
  For yet another comparison, I found a credible source stating that the southern right whale — which has testicles even larger than the blue whale's, weighing in a half-a-ton apiece — produces about five gallons of ejaculate in a single mating session. Five gallons, not 500.
  The statistic is clearly bogus.
  Finally, there's the question of whether the animal depicted in the viral image is even a blue whale at all — which, actually, it appears it is not. Blue whales average at least 75 feet in length. Using the human beings in the image above for scale, the creature is clearly smaller than a blue whale and most likely isn't any kind of whale at all, but rather a whale shark . Since sharks don't have penises per se, we must further conclude that either the photograph was doctored (though I could detect no obvious signs of that), or the spectacular appendage dangling between the animal's pelvic fins is one of its claspers , a pair of tubular organs with which a male shark fastens itself to the female and inseminates her during reproduction.
  • Blue whales can't possibly ejaculate 400 gallons of sperm (the capacity of an average-sized hot tub) — not even close.
  • The animal in the photo probably isn't a blue whale, nor is the circled appendage its penis.
  • There are good reasons to avoid making a habit of drinking sea water, but sperm spillover isn't one of them.
  • Which is more than can be said for hot tub water.

"In-N-Out Burger Cup Says "Hail Satan"","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/fl/In-N-Out-Burger-Hail-Satan.htm","2016-08-23 06:44:51","  By David Emery
  There are parts of the United States where no one has ever heard of In-N-Out Burger , a west coast fast food chain known for the quality of its food and cleanliness of its restaurants (a fact), and rumored to be owned and operated by Christian fanatics (an exaggeration).
  For the benefit of the uninitiated, the rumor exists, in large part, because one of the many quirky features of In-N-Out Burger is its policy of printing biblical citations on its packaging — 'John 3:16' on the bottoms of soda cups, for example, 'Proverbs 3:5' on milkshake cups and 'Revelation 3:20' on burger wrappers.
  People find it odd and fascinating, especially the first time they encounter it, which is why there are hundreds of photos of these citations on the Internet.
  It's also why there's at least one photo of an In-N-Out cup that says 'Hail Satan' (see above).
  The devilish image has been making the Internet rounds for upwards of five years, and probably had its biggest spike in circulation when it turned up in a July 27, 2011 tweet by Weird Al Yankovic.
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Yankovic didn't create the image, mind you. According to Snopes.com there are postings of it dating back to 2010, and it may even be older than that.
  It's a hoax, of course. In the original photograph (on Flickr), the cup bore the inscription 'John 3:16.'
  The 'Hail Satan' version is obviously a sarcastic spoof of the actual Bible references on In-N-Out packaging, but that begs a question: Why are those references  there in the first place? Is it really because the owners of In-N-Out are religious zealots trying to convert the whole world to Christianity, burger by burger?
  Not exactly.
  The company has never issued an official explanation, but Dean Atkins, a regional manager for the food chain, was asked about the Bible references by the Gilroy Dispatch in 2006. Atkins said the practice started during the 1980s on the orders of Rich Snyder, one of the sons of In-N-Out founder Harry Snyder and by all accounts an evangelical Christian.
  'It was just something he wanted to do,' Atkins told the Dispatch (in other words, a whim). There's little evidence that other family members in the business shared his passion for evangelizing, but the practice was kept going after Rich Snyder died in a plane crash in 1993 'out of respect for him,' said Atkins.
  In any case, citing the Bible on its packaging doesn't seem to have hurt the company's success — in fact, who knows, maybe it helped by adding a soupçon of mystique. Other companies are starting to do it, too.
  By the same token, the circulation of an image of an In-N-Out cup bearing a satanic slogan doesn't seem to have hurt business, either. Food for thought.
  Bible references:
  John 3:16. 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'
  Proverbs 3:5. 'Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.'
  Revelation 3:20. 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.'

"Video of UFO "Hiding Behind Cloud" Is a Hoax","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fauxphotos/ss/Fake-Video-of-UFO-Emerging-From-Cloud.htm","2016-06-03 13:59:15","  Description: Viral video / Hoax Circulating since: February 2011 Status: Fake
  Analysis: Contrary to what's claimed in some quarters, this video is clearly not being 'deleted all over the Internet' by unnamed government agencies who don't want its existence revealed. It has been posted and reposted thousands of times since its original upload in 2011 and can easily be found on numerous websites, including YouTube.
  Shot outdoors with a handheld camera, the shaky, poor-quality video is meant to convey the impression that a UFO sighting in São Paulo, Brazil was spontaneously documented by freaked-out bystanders, but in fact it's a carefully crafted hoax created for an advertising campaign.
  The video made international headlines after going viral in February 2011 but was instantly pooh-poohed by skeptics, including a video editing expert interviewed by the São Paulo TV station G1 who said that a frame-by-frame analysis revealed the use of special effects.
  One of the creators of the video, Andre Angelico of Atitude Comunicação, a Brazilian marketing firm, subsequently admitted in an interview with BrazilTodayNews.com that it was conceived as a viral promotion for a pizza box manufacturer and was 'unintentionally leaked' on the Internet.
