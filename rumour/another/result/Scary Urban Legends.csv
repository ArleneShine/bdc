"10 Things to Know About Slender Man","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/tp/10-Things-to-Know-About-Slender-Man.htm","2015-10-06 20:27:18","  He's one of the most talked-about online phenomena , and for good reason — Slender Man is one scary dude, a dread-inspiring boogeyman for the digital age. He has at least half a dozen nicknames, including 'Slendy,' 'The Tall Man,' Mr. Slim,' 'Daddy Longlegs,' and 'The Operator.' The chatter started in 2009, when mysterious photos started going around showing a creepy, ghostly figure clothed in black stalking children in schoolyards and playgrounds. It was rumored that the people who took the photographs were never seen or heard from again. Their disappearances were blamed on Slender Man, as were those of many missing children, and even some adults, all over the world.
  You'll know Slender Man when you see him. He's gaunt, stands eight to ten feet tall, and instead of arms and hands has multiple, writhing tentacles that come to razor-sharp points (the better to skewer his victims!). Creepiest of all, they say Slender Man doesn't have a face. In photographs and drawings his face is rendered either completely featureless and blank — a fuzzy, amorphous blob — or wrapped in gauze like a mummy.
  Slendy's sartorial trademark is a black suit, and in some photographs he's even shown wearing a necktie! Apart from that single detail — the necktie — Slender Man's wardrobe rarely varies in physical depictions of him. To recap what you should be on the lookout for: an eight-to-ten-foot-tall faceless man with tentacles for arms, impeccably dressed in a neat black suit and tie. There's no mistaking him for anyone else!
  Slender Man sightings go all the way back to the 1500s, according to websites documenting the Slender Man 'mythos.' They cite 16th-century woodcut prints of a creature known in Germany as Der Großmann ('The Tall Man'), a skeletal figure with multiple legs and spear-like arms depicted in the act of impaling adults and/or stealing their children. Quoted sources describe Der Großmann as an 'evil fairy' who lives in the Black Forest and hunts down 'bad children' foolish enough to venture there alone.
  'Slender Man has links to many Proxies , or insane individuals under its control or influence,' reports the Slender Man Wiki, a repository of information about Slendy and his mythos (which includes various role-playing games). 'It is suspected that Proxies do the actual, physical work for Slender Man, such as creating and manipulating objects, destroying and leaving evidence, creating videos and responding on Twitter, and influencing victims as needed.'
  In two separate incidents, adolescent girls were accused of knife attacks allegedly inspired by stories they read about Slender Man online. The first, on May 31, 2014, involved two 12-year-old girls who stabbed a classmate in Waukesha, Wisconsin. They told police the attack was meant to 'impress' Slender Man so they could become his Proxies. A few weeks later,, a 13-year-old Ohio girl 'obsessed with Slender Man' attacked her own mother with a knife, causing minor injuries. The girl in the second attack was described by her mother as having 'mental health issues,' and at least one of the perpetrators in the first attack was ruled mentally incompetent for trial.
  This bears repeating: Slender Man doesn't exist! He's an invented character , a fictional boogeyman in a crowdsourced horror story. Apart from the real-life stabbing incidents attributed to some kids' obsession with Slender Man lore, everything you've read about him was completely made up. The character was created from scratch by participants in an online Photoshop contest in 2009, and enthusiasts have been adding to the 'mythos' ever since. Even Slender Man's supposed historical predecessor, Der Großmann, is a Photoshop creation (the 'woodcuts' of him were created by altering original prints by famed 16th-century artist Hans Holbein).
  Slender Man isn't real. He's an Internet urban legend. Don't let him scare you!

"13 Creepy Stories to Tell After Dark","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/ss/Campfire-Tales.htm","2015-07-21 04:08:48","  IT'S THE WITCHING HOUR on a dark, moonless night. You're huddled with friends around a campfire in the woods far from town, taking turns telling stories. Someone has just recounted a particularly eerie tale about an encounter with a ghost, insisting it was true. You sit quietly, staring into the flames, reluctant to let on that it actually made your skin crawl. Then someone in the shadows clears his throat and begins to speak: ' Did you hear the one about. . . '
  A YOUNG girl named Lisa often had to spend time alone at home at night, as her parents worked late. They bought her a dog to keep her company and protect her.
  One night Lisa was awakened by a dripping sound. She got up and went to the kitchen to turn off the tap properly. As she was getting back into the bed she stuck her hand under the bed, and the dog licked it.
  The dripping sound continued, so she went to the bathroom and made sure the tap was turned off there, too.
  She went back to her bedroom and stuck her hand under the bed, and the dog licked it again.
  But the dripping continued, so she went outside and turned off all the faucets out there. She came back to bed, stuck her hand under it, and the dog licked it again.
  The dripping continued: drip, drip, drip. This time she listened and located the source of the dripping — it was coming from her closet! She opened the closet door, and there found her poor dog hanging upside down with its neck cut. Written on the window on the inside of the cupboard was, 'Humans can lick, too!!!'

  ONE NIGHT a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. She noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911!'
  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.

  TWO DORMMATES in college were in the same science class. The teacher had just reminded them about the midterm the next day when one dormmate — let's call her Julie — got asked to this big bash by the hottest guy in school. The other dormmate, Meg, had pretty much no interest in going and, being a diligent student, she took notes on what the midterm was about. After the entire period of flirting with her date, Julie was totally unprepared for her test, while Meg was completely prepared for a major study date with her books.
  At the end of the day, Julie spent hours getting ready for the party while Meg started studying. Julie tried to get Meg to go, but she was insistent that she would study and pass the test. The girls were rather close and Julie didn't like leaving Meg alone to be bored while she was out having a blast. Julie finally gave up, using the excuse that she would cram in homeroom the next day.
  Julie went to the party and had the time of her life with her date. She headed back to the dorm around 2 a.m. and decided not to wake Meg. She went to bed nervous about the midterm and decided she would wake up early to ask Meg for help.
  She woke up and went to wake Meg. Meg was lying on her stomach, apparently sound asleep. Julie rolled Meg over to reveal Meg's terrified face. Julie, concerned, turned on the desk lamp. Meg's study stuff was still open and had blood all over it. Meg had been slaughtered. Julie, in horror, fell to the floor and looked up to see, written on the wall in Meg's blood: 'AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU DIDN'T TURN ON THE LIGHT?'

  MY GREAT-GREAT grandmother, ill for quite some time, finally passed away after lying in a coma for several days. My great-great grandfather was devastated beyond belief, as she was his one true love and they had been married over 50 years. They were married so long it seemed as if they knew each other's innermost thoughts.
  After the doctor pronounced her dead, my great-great grandfather insisted that she was not.
  They had to literally pry him away from his wife's body so they could ready her for burial.
  Now, back in those days they had backyard burial plots and did not drain the body of its fluids. They simply prepared a proper coffin and committed the body (in its coffin) to its permanent resting place. Throughout this process, my great-great grandfather protested so fiercely that he had to be sedated and put to bed. His wife was buried and that was that.
  That night he woke to a horrific vision of his wife hysterically trying to scratch her way out of the coffin. He phoned the doctor immediately and begged to have his wife's body exhumed. The doctor refused, but my great-great grandfather had this nightmare every night for a week, each time frantically begging to have his wife removed from the grave.
  Finally the doctor gave in and, together with local authorities, exhumed the body. The coffin was pried open and to everyone's horror and amazement, my great-great grandmother's nails were bent back and there were bloody scratch-marks on the inside of the coffin.

  A TEENAGE boy drove his date to a dark and deserted Lovers' Lane for a make-out session. After turning on the radio for mood music, he leaned over and began kissing the girl.
  A short while later, the music suddenly stopped and an announcer's voice came on, warning in an urgent tone that a convicted murderer had just escaped from the state insane asylum — which happened to be located not far from Lovers' Lane — and that anyone who noticed a strange man lurking about with a hook in place of his right hand should immediately report his whereabouts to the police.
  The girl became frightened and asked to be taken home. The boy, feeling bold, locked all the doors instead and, assuring his date they would be safe, attempted to kiss her again. She became frantic and pushed him away, insisting that they leave. Relenting, the boy peevishly jerked the car into gear and spun its wheels as he pulled out of the parking space.
  When they arrived at the girl's house she got out of the car, and, reaching to close the door, began to scream uncontrollably. The boy ran to her side to see what was wrong and there, dangling from the door handle, was a bloody hook!

  SO-AND-SO'S FRIEND, a girl in her teens, is babysitting for a family in Newport Beach, Ca. The family is wealthy and has a very large house — you know the sort, with a ridiculous amount of rooms. Anyways, the parents are going out for a late dinner/movie. The father tells the babysitter that once the children are in bed she should go into this specific room (he doesn't really want her wandering around the house) and watch TV there.
  The parents take off and soon she gets the kids into bed and goes to the room to watch TV. She tries watching TV, but she is disturbed by a clown statue in the corner of the room. She tries to ignore it for as long as possible, but it starts freaking her out so much that she can't handle it.
  She resorts to calling the father and asks, 'Hey, the kids are in bed, but is it okay if I switch rooms? This clown statue is really creeping me out.'
  The father says seriously, 'Get the kids, go next door and call 911.'
  She asks, 'What's going on?'
  He responds, 'Just go next door and once you call the police, call me back.'
  She gets the kids, goes next door, and calls the police. When the police are on the way, she calls the father back and asks, 'So, really, what's going on?'
  He responds, 'We don't HAVE a clown statue.' He then further explains that the children have been complaining about a clown watching them as they sleep. He and his wife had just blown it off, assuming that they were having nightmares.
  The police arrive and apprehend the 'clown,' who turns out to be a midget. A midget clown! I guess he was some homeless person dressed as a clown, who somehow got into the house and had been living there for several weeks. He would come into the kids' rooms at nights and watch them while they slept. As the house was so large, he was able to avoid detection, surviving off their food, etc. He had been in the TV room right before the babysitter right came in there. When she entered he didn't have enough time to hide, so he just froze in place and pretended to be a statue.

  MY COUSIN and his wife lived in Sydney with this huge doberman in a little apartment off Maroubra Road. One night they went out for dinner and a spot of clubbing. By the time they got home it was late and my cousin was more than a little drunk. They got in the door and were greeted by the dog choking to death in the loungeroom.
  My cousin just fainted, but his wife rang the veterinarian, who was an old family friend of hers, and got her to agree to meet her at the surgery.
  The wife drives over and drops off the dog, but decides that she'd better go home and get her hubby into bed.
  She gets home and finally slaps my cousin into consciousness, but he's still drunk. It takes her almost half an hour to get him up the stairs, and then the phone rings. She's tempted to just leave it, but she decides that it must be important or they wouldn't be ringing that late at night. As soon as she picks up the phone, she hears the vet's voice screaming out:
  'Thank God I got you in time! Leave the house! Now! No time to explain!' Then the vet hangs up.
  Because she's such an old family friend, the wife trusts her, and so she starts getting the hubby down the stairs and out of the house. By the time they've made it all the way out, the police are outside. They rush up the front stairs past the couple and into the house, but my cousin's wife still doesn't have a clue what's going on.
  The vet shows up and says, 'Have they got him? Have they got him?'
  'Have they got who?' says the wife, starting to get really pissed off.
  'Well, I found out what the dog was choking on – it was a human finger.'
  Just then the police drag out a dirty, stubbly man who is bleeding profusely from one hand. 'Hey Sarge,' one of them yells. 'We found him in the bedroom.'

  PLEASE TAKE caution. Pass this along to your friends and family.
  Something terrible happened to a 10-year-old girl who had braids. The little girl had been wearing her braids in a ponytail for the longest time, and apparently the braids were old, at least 2 to 3 months old, and the mother never took them down to wash them or let them air out or anything.
  Anyway, the girl had been complaining to her mother about having a headache for about two weeks, but her mother just brushed it off, assuming that she had hit her head against the wall or something.
  Well, one morning the child again complained to her mother about having a headache while getting ready for school. Again, the mother brushed her off. When the child got to school, she told her teacher that her head was hurting. The teacher assumed that the braids were too tight in the child's hair and attempted to let the ponytail down. When she removed the hair piece and let the braids loose, there was a spider in the child's hair.
  The spider had laid eggs in the child's hair and the spiders were eating her scalp. She was rushed to the hospital, where she later died.
  This happened in Monroe, La. It was all over the news and in the papers for about a week or so. Please, parents, don't leave braids or any kind of hair extensions in children's (or your own) hair — no more than 2-3 weeks!

  BACK IN '75 a young couple, both 18, decided to get married right after high school. The father of the bride lived in Palm Beach in a mansion and was able to afford a big wedding for them. To make a long story short, they got married and the wedding was beautiful.
  After the wedding they had a big reception in an old building and everyone got pretty drunk. When there were only about 20 people left, the groom decided that they should play hide-and-seek.
  Everyone agreed and the groom was 'it.' They all went and hid and the game went on.
  After about 20 minutes everyone had been found except the bride. Everyone looked everywhere and tore the whole place apart looking for her. After a few hours the groom was furious, thinking the bride was playing a terrible trick. Eventually, everyone went home.
  A few weeks later the groom, having placed a missing persons report, gave up looking for her. Heartbroken, he tried to go on with his life.
  Three years later a little old woman was cleaning the place up. She happened to be in the attic and saw an old trunk. She dusted it off, and, out of curiosity, opened it. She screamed at the top of her lungs, ran out of the building and called the police.
  Apparently, the bride had decided to hide in the trunk for the game of hide-and-seek. When she sat down, the lid fell, knocking her unconscious and locking her inside. She suffocated after a day or so. When the woman found her, she was rotting, her mouth in the shape of a scream.

  A NEWLYWED husband and wife went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, and checked into a suite at a hotel. When they got to their room they both detected a bad odor. The husband called down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the room smelled very bad and they would like another suite. The manager apologized and told the man that they were all booked because of a convention.
  He offered to send them to a restaurant of their choice for lunch compliments of the hotel and said he was going to send a maid up to their room to clean and to try and get rid of the odor.
  After a nice lunch the couple went back to their room. When they walked in they could both still smell the same odor. Again the husband called the front desk and told the manager that the room still smelled really bad. The manager told the man that they would try and find a suite at another hotel. He called every hotel on the strip, but every hotel was sold out because of the convention. The manager told the couple that they couldn't find them a room anywhere, but they would try and clean the room again. The couple wanted to see the sights and do a little gambling anyway, so they said they would give them two hours to clean and then they would be back.
  When the couple had left, the manager and all of housekeeping went to the room to try and find what was making the room smell so bad. They searched the entire room and found nothing, so the maids changed the sheets, changed the towels, took down the curtains and put new ones up, cleaned the carpet and cleaned the suite again using the strongest cleaning products they had.
  The couple came back two hours later to find the room still had a bad odor. The husband was so angry at this point, he decided to find whatever this smell was himself. So he started tearing the entire suite apart himself.
  As he pulled the top mattress off the box spring he found a dead body of a woman.

  A MARRIED couple were going out for the evening and called in a teenage babysitter to take care of their three children. When she arrived they told her they probably wouldn't be back until late, and that the kids were already asleep so she needn't disturb them.
  The babysitter starts doing her homework while awaiting a call from her boyfriend. After awhile the phone rings. She answers it, but hears no one on the other end — just silence, then whoever it is hangs up.
  After a few more minutes the phone rings again. She answers, and this time there's a man on the line who says, in a chilling voice, 'Have you checked the children?'
  Click.
  At first she thinks it might have been the father calling to check up and he got interrupted, so she decides to ignore it. She goes back to her homework, then the phone rings again. 'Have you checked the children?' says the creepy voice on the other end.
  'Mr. Murphy?' she asks, but the caller hangs up again.
  She decides to phone the restaurant where the parents said they'd be dining, but when she asks for Mr. Murphy she is told that he and his wife had left the restaurant 45 minutes earlier. So she calls the police and reports that a stranger has been calling her and hanging up. 'Has he threatened you?' the dispatcher asks. No, she says. 'Well, there's nothing we can really do about it. You could try reporting the prank caller to the phone company.'
  A few minutes go by and she gets another call. 'Why haven't you checked the children?' the voice says.
  'Who is this?' she asks, but he hangs up again. She dials 911 again and says, 'I'm scared. I know he's out there, he's watching me.'
  'Have you seen him?' the dispatcher asks. She says no. 'Well, there isn't much we can do about it,' the dispatcher says. The babysitter goes into panic mode and pleads with him to help her. 'Now, now, it'll be okay,' he says. 'Give me your number and street address, and if you can keep this guy on the phone for at least a minute we'll try to trace the call. What was your name again?'
  'Linda.'
  'Okay, Linda, if he calls back we'll do our best to trace the call, but just keep calm. Can you do that for me?'
  'Yes,' she says, and hangs up. She decides to turn the lights down so she can see if anyone's outside, and that's when she gets another call.
  'It's me,' the familiar voice says. 'Why did you turn the lights down?'
  'Can you see me?' she asks, panicking.
  'Yes,' he says after a long pause.
  'Look, you've scared me,' she says. 'I'm shaking. Are you happy? Is that what you wanted?'
  'No.'
  'Then what do you want?' she asks.
  Another long pause. 'Your blood. All over me.'
  She slams the phone down, terrified. Almost immediately it rings again. 'Leave me alone!' she screams, but it's the dispatcher calling back. His voice is urgent.
  'Linda, we've traced that call. It's coming from another room inside the house. Get out of there! Now!!!'
  She tears to the front door, attempting to unlock it and dash outside, only to find the chain at the top still latched. In the time it takes her to unhook it she sees a door open at the top of the stairs. Light streams from the children's bedroom, revealing the profile of a man standing just inside.
  She finally gets the door open and bursts outside, only to find a cop standing on the doorstep with his gun drawn. At this point she's safe, of course, but when they capture the intruder and drag him downstairs in handcuffs, she sees he is covered in blood. Come to find out, all three children have all been murdered.

"Alligators in the Sewers","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/alligators/a/sewer_gators.htm","2016-06-25 14:13:49","  By David Emery
  Legend has it...
  It was once a fad among New Yorkers vacationing in Florida to bring back baby alligators for their children to raise as pets. These infant gators eventually grew up and outlived their cuteness, sad to say, at which point their desperate owners flushed them down the toilet to get rid of them.
  Some of these hastily disposed-of saurians managed to survive and breed in the dank Manhattan sewer system, so the story goes, producing colonies of giant, albino alligators beneath the streets of New York City. Their descendants thrive down there to this day, completely hidden — apart from the rare heart-stopping encounter between sewer gator and sewer worker, that is — from human eyes.
  Analysis: I love this story as much as the next guy, but it's folklore, not fact. Herpetologists pooh-pooh the very idea of alligators thriving in the New York City sewer system. It's cold down there most of the time, they point out — freezing cold during the winter — and alligators require a warm environment year-round to survive, much less reproduce and burgeon into colonies.

  If the cold weather didn't kill them off, the polluted sewer water certainly would.
  There's a grain of truth at the heart of this decades-old urban legend, however, namely the documented capture of an eight-foot-long alligator at the bottom of an East Harlem manhole in 1935 — though no one at the time assumed the creature actually lived down there. Instead, it was theorized that the 'gator probably tumbled off a steamer visiting the northeast 'from the mysterious Everglades, or thereabouts,' then swam up the Harlem River. It met an unfortunate end at the hands of the teenage boys who found it.
  The earliest published reference to alligators in the sewer -- in what Jan Harold Brunvand refers to as the 'standardized' form of the urban legend ('baby alligator pets, flushed, thrived in sewers') — can be found in the 1959 book, The World Beneath the City , a history of public utilities in New York City written by Robert Daley. Daley's source was a retired sewer official named Teddy May, who claimed that during his tenure in the 1930s he personally investigated workers' reports of subterranean saurians and saw a colony of them with his own eyes. He also claimed to have supervised their eradication. May was a colorful storyteller, if not a particularly reliable one.
  The tale was well known throughout the United States by the late 1960s, when, according to folklorist Richard M. Dorson, it came to be associated with another icon of sewer lore, the mythical 'New York White' — an especially potent, albino strain of marijuana growing wild from seeds spilled out of baggies hastily flushed down toilets during drug raids. Not that anyone had ever actually seen the stuff, much less smoked it. It was impossible to harvest, you see, because of all the alligators down there.
  Adding fodder to the legend is the intriguing fact that wayward alligators — escaped or abandoned pets, we assume — do occasionally turn up in the streets of New York City, and never fail to cause a ruckus. For example:
  • June 2001 - A small alligator (actually a caiman, as it turned out) was spotted and eventually captured in Central Park .
  • November 2006 - A two-foot-long caiman is captured outside an apartment building in Brooklyn. Police say it 'snapped and hissed' at them.
  • August 2010 - A two-foot-long alligator was captured in Queens after eyewitnesses spotted it hiding under a parked car.
  'What could better serve as a metaphor for the city as a jungle than the belief that the New York sewer system is filled with albino alligators, which swim through toilet pipes and bite victims in public washrooms?' — Gary Alan Fine, folklorist
  'The theme of displaced creatures is an old one, and modern folklore has spawned many rumors of an animal — usually a fearsome one — lurking where it does not belong.' — Jan Harold Brunvand, folklorist
  'I would bring leftovers from lunch, a long line and a hook, and spend a part of each day in the sewers looking for alligators. I saw rats, cockroaches — probably caught a lot of sicknesses — but I never saw anything like an alligator.' — Frank Indiviglio, herpetologist
  'It’s like the Loch Ness Monster or the Big Foot. People believe in those stories up to a point that it does make sense.' — Esteban Rodriguez, NYC sewer worker

  It goes without saying that I get some strange and disconcerting emails from time to time — I write about urban legends, after all — but one day I found a creepier-than-usual message in my inbox from a reader named Anna. Little did I suspect it would come to seem even creepier as the day wore on.
  This is what she wrote:
  'I just got a call from 999-999-9999 on my cell phone. Called it back and got my Nextel directory assistance who say they can't call out. I looked it up on Google and there was reference to a Thai movie that had a similar plot to The Ring , except you actually call the number and something horrible happens to you. Any news on this one?'
  Well, I Googled the number myself and, sure enough, buried among hundreds of results confirming that lots and lots of other folks have received mysterious calls from the same number I found a website hawking DVDs of a movie called 999-9999 . The plot is described as follows:

  Naturally, I had to try this myself. I dialed the number. CLICK . A recorded message followed. 'Your call cannot be completed as dialed,' it said. Feeling no ill effects, I made a mental note to look into it further and went back to reading my email. Several hours later the phone — my phone —  rang. I was busy at the time and didn't pick up, but curiosity got the better of me when I saw the 'New Message' light come on, so I checked the caller ID . This, I kid you not, is what I saw (cue sinister music):
  Unknown Name. 999-999-9999. Coincidence? What are the odds? I punched in my voicemail password. This is what I heard (turn up volume on sinister music):
  'Hello. This is a friendly reminder from Blockbuster. Our records show that as of Thursday, November 17th, Jeff _______ has some items that have not been returned by the due date listed on your receipt.'
  Mystery solved. It was Blockbuster Video. Apparently they were using the same caller ID spoofing technology employed by collection agencies, unscrupulous telemarketers and not a few con artists to prevent recipients of their calls from knowing who's on the other end of the line. Mundane explanation, but true. By all accounts, the practice is becoming increasingly common. So, not only did I survive the 'phone call of death,' I'm relieved to say, it turned out my Blockbuster Video account was in perfectly good standing. The deadbeat they were trying to collect from had given them the wrong phone number.
  One day he will receive a mysterious call. Postscript: In April 2007, panic erupted in Pakistan, the Middle East and Africa after forwarded emails circulated warning mobile phone users not to accept calls from certain numbers because they were known to trigger a high-frequency signal causing brain hemorrhage and death. Authorities ruled the warnings a hoax .

"Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/turn_on_light.htm","2016-05-31 02:30:50","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Roommate's Death'
  As told by reader W. Horton:
  Two dormmates in college were in the same science class. The teacher had just reminded them about the midterm the next day when one dormmate — let's call her Juli — got asked to this big bash by the hottest guy in school. The other dormmate, Meg, had pretty much no interest in going and, being a diligent student, she took notes on what the midterm was about. After the entire period of flirting with her date, Juli was totally unprepared for her test, while Meg was completely prepared for a major study date with her books.
  At the end of the day, Juli spent hours getting ready for the party while Meg started studying. Juli tried to get Meg to go, but she was insistent that she would study and pass the test. The girls were rather close and Juli didn't like leaving Meg alone to be bored while she was out having a blast. Juli finally gave up, using the excuse that she would cram in homeroom the next day.

  Juli went to the party and had the time of her life with her date. She headed back to the dorm around 2 a.m. and decided not to wake Meg. She went to bed nervous about the midterm and decided she would wake up early to ask Meg for help.
  She woke up and went to wake Meg. Meg was lying on her stomach, apparently sound asleep. Juli rolled Meg over to reveal Meg's terrified face. Juli, concerned, turned on the desk lamp. Meg's study stuff was still open and had blood all over it. Meg had been slaughtered. Juli, in horror, fell to the floor and looked up to see, written on the wall in Meg's blood: 'AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU DIDN'T TURN ON THE LIGHT?'
  As told by reader Jon Little:
  I heard about a girl who went back to her dorm room late one night to get her books before heading to her boyfriend's room for the night. She entered but did not turn on the light, knowing that her roommate was sleeping. She stumbled around the room in the dark for several minutes, gathering books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. before finally leaving.
  The next day, she came back to her room to find it surrounded by police. They asked if she lived there and she said yes. They took her into her room, and there, written in blood on the wall, were the words, 'Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?' Her roommate was being murdered while she was getting her things.
  (I've heard this several different times. Each time it was at a different university.)
  Analysis: This is a variant of a popular urban legend given the title ' The Roommate's Death ' by folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand (see his book, The Vanishing Hitchhiker , published by W.W. Norton, in 1981). In every version of 'The Roommate's Death' someone is murdered right under the nose of an unsuspecting female protagonist, but because the lights are out, or the crime takes place in another room, the victim's body isn't discovered until later, usually the next morning. As the story is sometimes told, the protagonist hears suspicious noises while the crime is being committed but is afraid to investigate because she thinks it could be an intruder coming after her .
  The 'creepiness factor' is very high in 'Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn On the Light?' On discovering the body, the main character can't help but realize what a close call she's had. And the murderer rubs it in with a message scrawled in blood.
  While the general form of the legend dates back at least 40 years (and surely more), it has a timeless appeal as a specimen of the 'American adolescent shocker story,' to borrow Brunvand's phrase. As he wrote in The Vanishing Hitchhiker ,
  As is often the case with so-called ' cautionary tales ,' however, the warning is of little practical use to the young people who hear and repeat the legend apart from providing catharsis vis-à-vis the normal trepidations that accompany growing up and moving away from home.

"Fear of Licking","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/cockroaches/a/fear_of_licking.htm","2016-04-26 04:14:59","  In the world according to urban folklore, horrors await us at every turn, lurking even in the most ordinary places. We are warned to beware of pay-phone coin slots booby-trapped with infectious needles, chicken sandwiches pocked with pus-filled tumors and toilet seats infested with venomous spiders.
  Is nothing safe anymore? Consider how dangerous it can be just to lick an envelope.
  In 1999, rumor had it that a number of people fell down dead after moistening the glue on ATM deposit envelopes with their tongues.
  Why? Because, supposedly, someone had adulterated the glue with cyanide, a fatal poison. The moral of the story was clear: envelope licking can be hazardous to your health. Don't do it.
  Not enough people paid heed, apparently, as evidenced by the following report sent to me by a reader in January 2000:
  Huh. Not to impugn the integrity of our correspondent's co-worker's spouse, but... baloney! The entire scenario smacked of urban legend — so much so that I demanded to know where the alleged incident took place. Virginia, I was told.
  Picture my skeptical reaction when, just a few days later, I began receiving copies of a forwarded email claiming that precisely the same thing had just happened to a postal worker in California:
  A true story? I think not. The separate accounts you have just read, the first set in Virginia and the second set clear across the country in California, arrived in my inbox five days apart (and more have arrived since). They are variants of the same urban legend . Any way you tell it, the urban legend is false.
  Consider this. A pregnant cockroach carries her eggs in a hard capsule called an ootheca, in which they incubate, intact, until the larvae (or 'nymphs') hatch, bursting the capsule open from the inside. The eggs themselves are tiny and delicate, and couldn't survive at all outside the ootheca, let alone flourish within the body of a mammalian host. It would be highly improbable, is what I'm saying, to find viable cockroach eggs strewn about on random surfaces — least of all on the folded flap of an envelope.
  Consider, too, the logical inconsistencies in the story. How is it that when the victim visited her doctor the first time, reporting a paper cut and showing visible signs of 'abnormal swelling,' he found 'nothing wrong'? And what was the point, during the second doctor visit, of X-raying the poor woman's tongue?
  The 'lump' allegedly detected by the x-ray was already in plain sight.
  Infestation legends derive from and play on people's horror of insects. The subtype in which 'creepy crawlers' invade the human body provoke an especially visceral response and are particularly popular for that reason. 'Roach Eggs on Envelopes' is very similar to the 1998-vintage ' Roach Eggs in Tacos ' legend, wherein cockroach larvae ingested in a fast food restaurant purportedly incubated in the lining of the victim's mouth.
  In a general way, both stories resemble 'The Spider Bite ,' an older legend about a traveler in a foreign country who discovers a seemingly innocuous insect bite on her body after an outing:
  It's not as if wayward insects never, ever find their way into crevices of the human body — they sometimes do, to the horror not only of the victim but of anyone who happens to hear the tale.
  But the bulk of infestation legends are just that: legends. They are concocted out of the teeniest, tiniest grains of truth, a generous sprinkling of latent dread, and a heaping helping of imagination. It's hard to resist sharing them with the ones you love.
  Reuters ran a news story a few years back about a British woman who complained to her doctor of a headache and 'strange noises in her ear.' On examining her, the doctor found a large spider lodged next to her eardrum.
  'The doctor removed the spider with a syringe,' the article continued, 'but also raised an unsavory possibility — that the arachnid was a female intent on laying eggs.'
  No spider eggs were found during the examination, however. So, why raise the 'unsavory possibility' at all?
  'Tis obvious: to make a good story that much better.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: Don't panic, it's a joke. It gives itself away as such in the very first sentence:
  There is no such medical journal. There is no 'United Medical Association.' If 'Dr. Beverly Clark' has ever had an article published in any legitimate scientific publication, for some mysterious reason it does not turn up in online searches. Moreover, there have been no recent news reports of spider-caused deaths among air travelers in Chicago.
  Nor, for that matter, is there a 'Blare Airport' in Chicago (try O'Hare International Airport ); nor a restaurant in Chicago (or anywhere else on earth) called 'Big Chappies.'
  Lastly, there is no real genus of spider known as Arachnius gluteus (apparently meant to be translated 'butt spider').
  Update: New Variant - A new version of this hoax first spotted in 2002 alleges that an Asian spider called the Two-striped Telamonia is now migrating to the U.S. under airliner toilet seats and has already killed five women in North Florida.
  Note: Australian Redback Spider - I've heard from several Aussie readers keen to point out that there is a spider in Australia known as the Redback ( Latrodectus hasselti ), the bite of which can be toxic and which is famous in popular lore — much like its American relative, the Black Widow — for residing under outdoor toilet seats. Though ' Arachnius gluteus ' remains a fiction, it is not without its precedents in real life and world folklore.

"Bloody Mary in the Mirror","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/bloody_mary.htm","2016-05-22 17:35:16","  Also known as 'Mary Worth,' 'I Believe in Mary Worth,' 'Mary Worthington,' 'Mary Jane,' 'I Believe in Mary Whales,' 'Mary White,' 'Hell Mary,' etc.
  Example:
  Some girls Kat didn't know invited her over for a sleepover. That night they played Truth or Dare. When it was Kat's turn she picked dare. One of the girls said, 'I dare you to do Bloody Mary.' Kat accepted. They gave Kat a lit candle and pushed her into the bathroom. Kat spun around three times and said, 'Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.'
  When nothing happened, she walked to the door. Before she could reach it, her only light blew out. She banged on the door, begging the other girls to open it, but they just laughed. She backed up against the door. The sink and the bath started to run. Thick, black blood poured out of the faucets and was soon overflowing onto the floor. Kat screamed a blood-curdling scream as Bloody Mary rose from the bloody water and crawled out. When she reached Kat she slit her throat and dragged her into the bath. The next morning, the other girls checked on her. When they saw her dead body, their screams could be heard for miles.
  Example, as told on the Internet, Feb. 16, 1994:
  When I was about 9 years old, I went to a friend's for a birthday/slumber party. There were about 10 other girls there. About midnight, we decided to play Mary Worth. Some of us had never heard of this so one of the girls told the story.
  Mary Worth lived a long time ago. She was a very beautiful young girl. One day she had a terrible accident that left her face so disfigured that nobody would look at her. She had not been allowed to see her own reflection after this accident for fear that she would lose her mind. Before this, she had spent long hours admiring her beauty in her bedroom mirror.
  One night, after everyone had gone to bed, unable to fight the curiosity any longer, she crept into a room that had a mirror. As soon as she saw her face, she broke down into terrible screams and sobs. It was at this moment that she was so heartbroken and wanted her old reflection back, that she walked into the mirror to find it, vowing to disfigure anybody that came looking for her in the mirror.
  After hearing this story, which was told very scarily, we decided to turn out all of the lights and try it. We all huddled around the mirror and starting repeating 'Mary Worth, Mary Worth, I believe in Mary Worth.'
  About the seventh time we said it one of the girls that was in front of the mirror started screaming and trying to push her way back away from the mirror. She was screaming so loud that my friends mom came running into the room. She quickly turned on the lights and found this girl huddled in the corner screaming. She turned her around to see what the problem and saw these long fingernail scratches running down her right cheek. I will never forget her face as long as I live!!

  Analysis: As best anyone can tell, the legend of Bloody Mary and its comparably gory variants ('Hell Mary,' 'I Believe in Mary Worth,' 'I Believe in Mary Whales,' etc.) first emerged in the early 1960s as an adolescent party game — albeit a very dark and creepy party game.
  Like so many folk rituals and urban legends , the exact time and place of its origin is impossible to pin down. Folklorists didn't begin recording examples of it until the 1970s.
  That said, there's a body of folklore and superstition attributing magical and/or divinatory properties to mirrors dating back to ancient times. The most familiar of these lingering into modernity is the centuries-old superstition that breaking a mirror brings bad luck . The idea that one can foretell the future by peering into a mirror is even older, described in the Bible (I Corinthians 13) as ' see[ing] through a glass, darkly .' There are mentions of looking-glass divination in Chaucer's Squire's Tale (c. 1390), Spenser's The Faerie Queen (1590), and Shakespeare's Macbeth (1606), among other early literary sources.
  A particular form of divination associated with Halloween in the British Isles entailed gazing into a mirror and performing a nonverbal ritual to summon a vision of one's future betrothed. This example is from the Poems of Robert Burns , published in 1787:
  Another example of mirror divination, in this case accompanied by ritual chanting, appears in the fairy tale ' Snow White ,' as told by the Brothers Grimm in 1857 (trans. by D.L. Ashliman):
  As everyone who grew up reading ' Snow White ' (or even watching the animated Disney version) knows, the mirror-obsessed queen was ultimately destroyed by her own vanity, and it is in this and similar cautionary tales that we see basic elements of the Bloody Mary ritual emerge.
  'If you look in a looking glass too long you are sure to see the devil,' warns a nineteenth-century English saying. A more visceral rendition of the same moral admonishment appears in a book of folklore published in 1883:
  A superstition that lingered from the eighteenth century well into the twentieth held that mirrors must be covered or turned to face the wall in the presence of a dead person. Some said this was to signify 'an end to all vanity.' Others took it to be a demonstration of respect for the dead. Still others believed an uncovered mirror was an open invitation for ghostly apparitions to appear.
  'It is not good for a corpse to be reflected in a glass or mirror . . . because the dead will not rest,' wrote Marie Trevalyan in Folklore and Folk-Stories of Wales (1909). The possible consequences of failing to act accordingly are made plain in this excerpt from a 1924 issue of Notes & Queries :
  What connects this quaint superstition to the Bloody Mary ritual is the motif of 'the apparition in the looking-glass' — the critical difference being that in the former the ghost appears because someone forgot to cover a mirror; in the latter, the ghost is purposely summoned.
  Make no mistake, when a gaggle of adolescents stand in front of a mirror chanting 'Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary,' or 'I believe in Mary Worth, I believe in Mary Worth,' at least some of them are uttering what they believe to be — or hope to be, or fear to be — a magic spell to conjure up a ghost or demon spirit.
  The notion that ritual incantations can be used to achieve supernatural ends derives not only from folklore and fairy tales, wherein remnants of so many age-old myths and superstitions are retained, but also from the childhood mindset itself, a mindset subject to a variety of forms of magical thinking. Among those is a phenomenon identified by developmental psychologist Jean Piaget as 'nominal realism,' which, simply put, is the tendency to confuse objects with their names, resulting in the belief that words and thoughts can influence real-world events.
  Of the many ways 'Bloody Mary' can be interpreted, the most obvious and literal is as a cautionary tale demonstrating the perils of playing with magic. But it's also a ghost story.
  The malevolent spirit called up by the Bloody Mary ritual is always said to be a female — in particular, a female whose face was disfigured as the result of a violent death, usually in an automobile accident. Often, as in the second 'Bloody Mary' variant reproduced above, she is said to have been a very beautiful woman in life who was proud of her beauty to the point of self-obsession (hence her ghostly ire at being summoned to appear in a mirror).
  In some variants she is said to have been a hitchhiker whose spirit has also been seen haunting roadsides and being picked up by unsuspecting drivers before vanishing inexplicably (cf. ' The Vanishing Hitchhiker '). In other tellings the character is reminiscent of La Llorona , the 'Weeping Woman' of Hispanic folklore who is said to have killed her own children and wanders eternally in penance.
  In most versions there's no connection drawn between the Bloody Mary whose ghost haunts bathroom mirrors and the historical figure of the same name (though exceptions have been recorded). Her name just happens to be Mary, and she's bloody because she died in a terrible accident.
  Likewise, there is no apparent connection between the Mary Worth of the legend and the Mary Worth of comic strip fame. Essentially a soap opera about the hardships of family life, the comic strip holds up its prim and proper protagonist as the ideal of American motherhood — a far cry from the menacing hag blamed for so many pajama party freak-outs.
  Some folklorists, notably Alan Dundes in his essay 'Bloody Mary in the Mirror: A Ritual Reflection of Pre-Pubescent Anxiety,' see the Bloody Mary game as analogous to coming-of-age rituals in non-western cultures.
  The age and gender of the participants (young girls about to enter puberty), references to blood in the legend (e.g. the title, 'Bloody Mary,' and anecdotal reports of participants being scratched or clawed by the apparition, drawing blood), and the fact that the ritual itself takes place in a bathroom all suggest a conceptual link with the onset of menstruation.
  Bloody Mary is an 'anticipatory ritual,' suggests Dundes, 'essentially warning girls of what to expect upon attaining puberty.' Performing it 'evokes feelings of excitement on the part of participants, excitement tinged with fear and apprehension as well.'
  Like so many horror legends and traditional ghost stories, 'Bloody Mary' has proven a natural for adaptation into popular novels, stories, comic books, movies, and even dolls. Released straight to DVD in 2005, Urban Legends: Bloody Mary was the third film in the execrable series that commenced with Urban Legend in 1998. As you might expect, the plot takes great liberties with the traditional tale.
  More notably, horror writer Clive Barker essentially constructed a pseudo-urban legend by appropriating the chanting ritual for a 1992 film entitled Candyman . Various characters in the film summon the ghost of a black slave brutally lynched in the 1800s by repeating the name 'Candyman' five times in front of a mirror. Some viewers come away with the misapprehension that Candyman was based on an actual folktale, but apart from the borrowed incantation it was mostly a product of Barker's fertile imagination.

  As told by reader Andy B.:
  A married couple were going out for the evening and called in a teenage babysitter to take care of their three children. When she arrived they told her they probably wouldn't be back until late, and that the kids were already asleep so she needn't disturb them.
  The babysitter starts doing her homework while awaiting a call from her boyfriend. After awhile the phone rings. She answers it, but hears no one on the other end — just silence, then whoever it is hangs up. After a few more minutes the phone rings again. She answers, and this time there's a man on the line who says, in a chilling voice, 'Have you checked the children?'
  Click.
  At first she thinks it might have been the father calling to check up and he got interrupted, so she decides to ignore it. She goes back to her homework, then the phone rings again. 'Have you checked the children?' says the creepy voice on the other end.
  'Mr. Murphy?' she asks, but the caller hangs up again.
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  She decides to phone the restaurant where the parents said they'd be dining, but when she asks for Mr. Murphy she is told that he and his wife had left the restaurant 45 minutes earlier. So she calls the police and reports that a stranger has been calling her and hanging up. 'Has he threatened you?' the dispatcher asks. No, she says. 'Well, there's nothing we can really do about it. You could try reporting the prank caller to the phone company.'
  A few minutes go by and she gets another call. 'Why haven't you checked the children?' the voice says.
  'Who is this?' she asks, but he hangs up again. She dials 911 again and says, 'I'm scared. I know he's out there, he's watching me.'
  'Have you seen him?' the dispatcher asks. She says no. 'Well, there isn't much we can do about it,' the dispatcher says. The babysitter goes into panic mode and pleads with him to help her. 'Now, now, it'll be okay,' he says. 'Give me your number and street address, and if you can keep this guy on the phone for at least a minute we'll try to trace the call. What was your name again?'
  'Linda.'
  'Okay, Linda, if he calls back we'll do our best to trace the call, but just keep calm. Can you do that for me?'
  'Yes,' she says, and hangs up. She decides to turn the lights down so she can see if anyone's outside, and that's when she gets another call.
  'It's me,' the familiar voice says. 'Why did you turn the lights down?'
  'Can you see me?' she asks, panicking.
  'Yes,' he says after a long pause.
  'Look, you've scared me,' she says. 'I'm shaking. Are you happy? Is that what you wanted?'
  'No.'
  'Then what do you want?' she asks.
  Another long pause. 'Your blood. All over me.'
  She slams the phone down, terrified. Almost immediately it rings again. 'Leave me alone!' she screams, but it's the dispatcher calling back. His voice is urgent.
  'Linda, we've traced that call. It's coming from another room inside the house. Get out of there! Now!!!'
  She tears to the front door, attempting to unlock it and dash outside, only to find the chain at the top still latched. In the time it takes her to unhook it she sees a door open at the top of the stairs. Light streams from the children's bedroom, revealing the profile of a man standing just inside.
  She finally gets the door open and bursts outside, only to find a cop standing on the doorstep with his gun drawn. At this point she's safe, of course, but when they capture the intruder and drag him downstairs in handcuffs, she sees he is covered in blood. Come to find out, all three children have all been murdered.
  Analysis: Teenagers have been scaring each other silly with this urban legend since the late 1960s, though most people nowadays are probably more familiar with it as the plot of the 1979 horror film When a Stranger Calls (or the 2006 remake of the same title). It's not based on any real-life incident, so far as anyone knows, but the scenario is plausible enough to give goosebumps to anyone with a sense of what it's like to be young and inexperienced and alone in a big house caring for someone else's children.
  'The most frightening aspect of this legend is that the babysitter is not in control at any time,' writes folklorist Gail De Vos. '[T]he caller multiplies the anxiety that the babysitter is already feeling as the responsible person in the household. The possibility that this could actually happen is never far from the mind of any babysitter.'
  Never mind the unlikelihood that police would be able to trace a phone call that lasted no more than 20 seconds at most, or that an officer could be dispatched to the house so quickly. Albeit framed as a cautionary tale , the main purpose of the story is to frighten us, not give us actionable information. That it's still going around some 40 years later is a testament to how successfully it accomplishes its goal.
  See also: ' The Clown Statue ,' a similar tale involving a teen babysitter trapped in a house with a menacing stranger, in this case disguised as a clown statue or oversize doll.

  As told by reader Autumn Murphy...
  A man and woman went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, and checked into a suite at a hotel. When they got to their room they both detected a bad odor. The husband called down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the room smelled very bad and they would like another suite. The manager apologized and told the man that they were all booked because of a convention. He offered to send them to a restaurant of their choice for lunch compliments of the hotel and said he was going to send a maid up to their room to clean and to try and get rid of the odor.
  After a nice lunch the couple went back to their room. When they walked in they could both still smell the same odor. Again the husband called the front desk and told the manager that the room still smelled really bad. The manager told the man that they would try and find a suite at another hotel. He called every hotel on the strip, but every hotel was sold out because of the convention. The manager told the couple that they couldn't find them a room anywhere, but they would try and clean the room again. The couple wanted to see the sights and do a little gambling anyway, so they said they would give them two hours to clean and then they would be back.

  When the couple had left, the manager and all of housekeeping went to the room to try and find what was making the room smell so bad. They searched the entire room and found nothing, so the maids changed the sheets, changed the towels, took down the curtains and put new ones up, cleaned the carpet and cleaned the suite again using the strongest cleaning products they had. The couple came back two hours later to find the room still had a bad odor. The husband was so angry at this point, he decided to find whatever this smell was himself. So he started tearing the entire suite apart himself.
  As he pulled the top mattress off the box spring he found a dead body of a woman.

  Befitting its 'Sin City' reputation, Las Vegas has been the setting of some horrific urban legends (see ' The Kidney Snatchers ' if you don't know what I mean). What sets 'The Body in the Bed' apart from the rest is how frequently incidents resembling the one described above have actually happened in real life — just never, to my knowledge, in Las Vegas !
  The closest encounter between fact and legend I've been able to document took place in Atlantic City (another gambling mecca, naturally) in 1999. This account comes from the Bergen Record :
  The body of Saul Hernandez, 64, of Manhattan was found in Room 112 of the Burgundy Motor Inn after two German tourists slept overnight in the bed despite a rancid smell that prompted them to complain to the front desk.
  The couple told motel officials about the smell Wednesday night but stayed in the $36-a-night room anyway. On Thursday, they complained again and were given a new room while a motel housekeeper cleaned Room 112.
  In July 2003, a cleaning crew discovered a dead body stuffed under the mattress in a room at the Capri Motel in Kansas City, Missouri. This report was filed by KMBC-TV News:
  Police said that the man appeared to have been dead for some time, but the body went unnoticed until a guest staying the room could no longer tolerate the smell.
  Officers were called to the Capri Motel in the 1400 block of Independence Avenue around noon Sunday after cleaning crews made the grisly discovery.
  KMBC's Emily Aylward reported that the man who checked into the motel room a few days ago complained to management about the odor two times over the three days. He then checked out on Sunday because he could not tolerate the smell.
  In March 2010, Memphis police responded to a call from a local motel where employees had noticed a 'foul odor' in one of the rooms. According to ABC Eyewitness News:
  On March 15th, investigators were called back to room 222 at the Budget Inn, where the body of Sony Millbrook was found under the bed. Police say she was found inside the metal box frame that sits directly on the floor after someone reported smelling a strange odor. The box springs and mattress fit into the top of the bed frame.
  Room 222, according to investigators, had been rented 5 times and cleaned many times by the hotel staff since the day Millbrook was reported missing.
  Homicide investigators say Millbrook appears to have been murdered.
  There's more than one moral to these story, to be sure, but the most disturbing of all is that urban legends do sometimes come true.

"The Dead Boyfriend","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/boyfriend_death.htm","2015-03-02 04:35:56","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Boyfriend's Death' and 'The Mad Axeman'
  Example #1: As told by Shirley Pugh...
  A girl and her boyfriend are making out in his car. They had parked in the woods so no one would see them. When they were done, the boy got out to pee and the girl waited for him in the safety of the car.
  After waiting five minutes, the girl got out of the car to look for her boyfriend. Suddenly, she sees a man in the shadows. Scared, she gets back in the car to drive away, when she hears a very faint squeak... squeak... squeak...
  This continued a few seconds until the girl decided she had no choice but to drive off. She hit the gas as hard as possible but couldn't go anywhere, because someone had tied a rope from the bumper of the car to a nearby tree.
  Well, the girl slams on the gas again and then hears a loud scream. She gets out of the car and realizes that her boyfriend is hanging from the tree. The squeaky noises were his shoes slightly scraping across the top of the car!!!

  Example #2: As told by Isabel Espaldon...
  Here's a story my mom told to me and my friends when I was about seven years old. You can imagine I was scared to death...
  A woman and her boyfriend were on their way home from somewhere (not important) one night, and suddenly his car ran out of gas. It was about one in the morning and they were completely alone in the middle of the nowhere.
  The guy stepped out of the car, saying comfortingly to his girlfriend, 'Don't worry, I'll be right back. I'm just going to go out for some help. Lock the doors, though.'
  She locked the doors and sat restlessly, waiting for her boyfriend to come back. Suddenly, she sees a shadow fall across her lap. She looks up to see... not her boyfriend, but a strange, crazed looking man. He is swinging something in his right hand.
  He sticks his face close to the window and slowly pulls up his right hand. In it is her boyfriend's decapitated head, twisted horribly in pain and shock. She shuts her eyes in horror and tries to make the image go away. When she opens her eyes, the man is still there, grinning psychotically. He slowly lifts his left hand, and he is holding her boyfriend's keys... to the car.
  Analysis: 'The Dead Boyfriend' is reminiscent of the hook-man urban legend , in which a pair of teenagers necking on Lovers' Lane race off in a fright after hearing a radio alert about a murderer on the loose with a hook for a hand. On returning home they discover, to their horror, a bloody hook dangling from one of the car door handles.
  Whereas the protagonists of 'The Hook' escape with their lives, the present tale concludes with the boyfriend murdered and the girlfriend in fatal jeopardy (though in some variants she is ultimately rescued by passersby). Folklorists regard both narratives as examples of cautionary tales but tend to interpret their meanings differently. 'The Hook' is usually read as a warning against adolescent sexual activity; 'The Dead Boyfriend' has been interpreted as a more generalized warning not to stray too far from the safety of home. 'On a literal level a story like 'The Boyfriend's Death' simply warns young people to avoid situations in which they may be endangered,' writes folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, 'but at a more symbolic level the story reveals society's broader fears of people, especially women and the young, being alone and among strangers in the darkened world outside the security of their own home or car.' ( The Vanishing Hitchhiker , W.W. Norton, 1981.)
  Thematically, ' campfire stories ' such as these have much in common with the plot lines of modern horror movies, but there is an important difference. Typically, the villains in slasher films exhibit supernatural traits such as inhuman strength and 'unkillability' (e.g., Michael Myers in Halloween and Freddie in Nightmare on Elm Street ), while the hook-handed madmen and crazed axe murderers of urban legendry are only slightly exaggerated versions of the real-life serial killers we read about in newspaper headlines .

"Is This a Brown Recluse Spider Bite?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/spiders/ss/brown_recluse_spider_bite.htm","2016-08-23 06:56:33","  Description: Viral images & text Circulating since: 2004 / Earlier Status: Unconfirmed
  Text example: Email contributed by L.M. More, July 6, 2004:
  Brown Recluse Spider Bite:
  Take a look at the email below and the attached pictures of a guy who was bit by a Brown Recluse spider. Some of the pictures towards the end are pretty nasty, but do take a look at the last one -- it is a picture of the spider itself. Now we all should know what to look out for.
  I thought this would be a good thing to send around to people as it is summertime and people are going to be digging around doing yard work, etc.
  The following illustrates the progression of a brown recluse spider bite.
  Just as a warning, day 3-6 photos are not too graphic. However, day 9 and 10 are very graphic. Your discretion is advised if you choose to view.
  The final picture is the most important as it contains a picture of the actual spider. Please be careful, spider bites are dangerous and can have permanent and highly negative consequences.
  FYI - They like the darkness and tend to live in storage sheds or attics or other areas that might not be frequented by people or light. If you have a need to be in your attic, go up there and turn on a light and leave it on for about 30 minutes before you go in to do your work.
  Warning: The following pages contain graphic medical images some readers may find disturbing.
  Regrettably, the ad hoc captions accompanying these viral images over time haven't included enough information to determine whether the wound depicted in them was caused by the bite of a brown recluse ('fiddleback') spider or something else.
  The origin of the images, which have been circulating online, uncredited, since 2004 (perhaps even earlier), remains unknown.
  The brown recluse spider is venomous and its bite can be quite painful, though the danger of a brown recluse spider bite is often overstated.
  In the photos, the wound itself looks real enough regardless of what may have caused it, and the lesions do resemble necrotic ulcers symptomatic of brown recluse spider bites . But they're also symptomatic of gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis , both of which can result from serious spider bites but have other known causes as well, and are easily mistaken for bite wounds. Experts say misdiagnoses of the causes of necrotic ulcers are quite common.
  Doctors say the majority of brown recluse bites are 'uneventful,' unlike the example in the photos, and rarely progress to such a serious stage.

"Bride-and-Seek (The Missing Bride)","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/a/The-Missing-Bride.htm","2017-01-05 15:10:04","  By David Emery
  After a lavish wedding in a stately mansion, members of the wedding party play a game of hide-and-seek. It isn't long before everyone is found. Everyone, that is, except the bride. This urban legend is also known as 'The Lost Bride,' 'Bride-and-Go-Seek,' 'Ginevra,' 'The Mistletoe Bough,' 'The Mistletoe Bride,' 'The Bride in the Oak Chest,' 'The Bride in the Trunk.'
  As told by a reader:
  A young woman was about to get married, and she decided she wanted to hold the wedding in the backyard of the large farmhouse where she grew up. It was a beautiful wedding, and everything went perfectly.
  Afterward, the guests played some casual party games, and someone suggested hide-and-seek so they could get the children to play too. It wouldn't be hard to find a place to hide around the house.
  The groom was 'it,' and the bride wanted to make sure that she won the game. When no one was looking, she slipped inside the house. She ran up to the attic, found an old trunk and hid in it.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  No one could find her. Her new husband wasn't worried, though, he figured she must have just gotten tired and went inside to rest. So everyone went home.
  The groom looked around the house, but he couldn't find her anywhere. He and her parents filed a missing person case, but she was never found.
  A few years later when her mother died, the woman's father went to go through his late wife's things that were collecting dust in the attic. He came to an old chest. The lid was closed, and the old lock was rusted over and holding it closed. He opened the lid and was terrified to see his daughter's decaying body in the chest. When she hid there, the lid had closed, and the rusty parts of the lock had latched together, trapping her there.
  As told by a reader:
  Back in '75 a young couple, both 18, decided to get married right after high school. The father of the bride lived in Palm Beach in a mansion and was able to afford a big wedding for them. To make a long story short, they got married, and the wedding was beautiful.
  After the wedding, they had a big reception in an old building, and everyone got pretty drunk. When there were only about 20 people left, the groom decided that they should play hide-and-seek. Everyone agreed, and the groom was 'it.' They all went and hid, and the game went on.
  After about 20 minutes everyone had been found except the bride. Everyone looked everywhere and tore the whole place apart looking for her. After a few hours, the groom was furious, thinking the bride was playing a terrible trick. Eventually, everyone went home.
  A few weeks later the groom, having placed a missing person report, gave up looking for her. Heartbroken, he tried to go on with his life.
  Three years later a little old woman was cleaning the place up. She happened to be in the attic and saw an old trunk. She dusted it off, and, out of curiosity, opened it. She screamed at the top of her lungs, ran out of the building and called the police.
  Apparently, the bride had decided to hide in the trunk for the game of hide-and-seek. When she sat down, the lid fell, knocking her unconscious and locking her inside. She suffocated after a day or so. When the woman found her, she was rotting, her mouth in the shape of a scream.
  As told by a reader:
  A bride and a groom were both very young, around 16, but decided to get married anyway, as was the way in those days. It was a huge, elaborate wedding and the reception was held at an old mansion, an heirloom of the family, of sorts.
  After most people had left and all were drunk of wedding champagne, the bride whined she was getting bored. When asked what she'd like to do, she grinned and said she always loved a good game of hide-and-seek. Though reluctant to play such a childish game, all agreed and the maid of honor was 'it.'
  It took only about 30 minutes for all to be found... all but the bride, that is. Everyone began searching the entire house, but no one found her. The groom, thinking maybe she had second thoughts about the marriage, grew angry and sent everyone home. After two or three days, he put out a missing persons report but no luck. Eventually, he moved on with his life.
  After the girl's father had died, the mansion was being cleaned, the family taking what they would before the auction came around. The mother of the long-gone bride ​was up in the storage attic, cleaning out the old clothes and junk when she saw an old trunk with a lock on it. After breaking the lock, she peered inside... and began to scream. All ran upstairs to see what was happening.
  Inside the trunk was the bride, dead after the lid fell on her head and crushed part of her skull... though she was still grinning at her little game of hide-and-seek.
  Even though one of the variants above takes place in modern-day Palm Beach, Florida, its Gothic flavor betrays the true longevity of this legend, which is at least 200 years old, probably more.
  The earliest version I've found in print is an anonymous newspaper article published in 1809 entitled ' A Melancholy Occurrence .' It opens with the announcement of a 'singular and calamitous event' in Germany, an incident 'long involved in the deepest mystery.' It ends, as above, with the discovery of a crumbling skeleton in an old, forgotten trunk — a trunk in which a newlywed bride had inadvertently locked herself and 'miserably perished' years before.
  The best-known version is an English ballad still sung at Christmastime on both sides of the Atlantic, ' The Mistletoe Bough ,' written by Thomas Haynes Bayly and set to music by Sir Henry Thomas around 1830.
  Bayly, it's said, took his inspiration from ' Ginevra ,' a rendition set in the palace of an Italian nobleman by the British poet Samuel Rogers, who included it in his volume Italy, a Poem in 1822. Rogers made an interesting admission in the endnotes of that book, namely that while he believed the tale to be based on fact, 'the time and place are uncertain. Many old houses in England lay claim to it.'
  Among those old houses are Minster Lovell Hall in Oxfordshire, Marwell Hall, Hampshire, Bramshill House , also in Hampshire, Tiverton Castle in Devon, and Exton Hall , Rutland (the list goes on). Each of the locales boasts a ghost story based on the legend. The ruins of Minster Lovell Hall have long been reputed to be haunted by a 'White Lady,' for example, identified by locals as the restless spirit of 'the mistletoe bride.' The phantom was mentioned in a New York Times article dated Dec. 28, 1924:
  Some 70 miles away, the halls of Bramshill House (now a Police College) have been said for at least 150 years to be haunted by an identical apparition, as noted by George Edward Jeans in Memorials of Old Hampshire , 1906:
  Despite the persistence of the legend in so many locales over so long a period, there's no historical evidence that any such event ever took place. A thorough discussion of the historicity of the tale (or lack thereof) may be found in Shafto Justin Adair Fitz-Gerald's 1898 book, Stories of Famous Songs .

"What's So Scary About Bunny Man Bridge?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/murderers/fl/Bunny-Man-Bridge.htm","2015-09-11 13:00:52","  By David Emery
  On Colchester Road in Fairfax County, Virginia , just outside the small town of Clifton , stands an unlikely tourist destination known officially as Colchester Overpass , unofficially as Bunny Man Bridge .
  To outward appearances there's nothing remarkable about the site, which consists of a one-lane concrete tunnel beneath a railroad track. What draws people to it, despite the fact that tourism is discouraged by local authorities , are the tales of mayhem and murder told about the place. What draws people to it is the Legend of the Bunny Man .
  The details vary in the telling, but there are two basic versions of the story. One begins with the closure of a nearby insane asylum, from which a busload of inmates were being transferred to another institution when two of the most dangerous escaped and hid in the woods. Despite a manhunt they eluded authorities for weeks, leaving the half-eaten carcasses of rabbits in their wake. Eventually one of them was found dead, hanging from the overpass.

  The other escapee, now dubbed 'the bunny man,' or simply 'Bunnyman,' was never found. Some say he was struck and killed by a passing train and his ghost continues to haunt the overpass to this day, killing and mutilating innocent passersby.
  The other version begins with a deranged teenager who one day donned a white bunny costume, murdered his entire family, then hung himself from the overpass. It's his spirit that haunts the bridge, chasing down visitors with his ax and disemboweling them. All told, some 32 people have supposedly died there.
  Bunny Man sightings have been reported in other locales as well, not only in Fairfax County but also in rural Maryland and the District of Columbia. When not committing outright murder, he is said to have chased children with his ax, attacked adults in their cars, and vandalized property.
  So, is the Bunny Man real? No — not the Bunny Man of legend, at any rate.
  No insane asylum has ever existed in or near Clifton, Virginia. That's according to archivist and historian Brian A. Conley, who extensively researched the Bunny Man stories for the Fairfax County Public Library. Nor is there any record of a local teenager murdering his family. No one has ever hung himself on Bunny Man Bridge, nor have any homicides occurred there. Like others who have attempted to verify these tales, Conley concluded they're false. 'In short,' he wrote, 'the Bunny Man did not exist.'
  However...
  On October 22, 1970, a curious story appeared in the Washington Post under the headline, 'Man in Bunny Suit Sought in Fairfax.' According to the report, a young man and his fiancee were sitting in his car in the 5400 block of Guinea Road — approximately seven miles due east of the Colchester Overpass — when they were accosted by a man 'dressed in a white suit with long bunny ears.' After complaining that they were trespassing, he threw a wooden-handled hatchet through the right front car window and 'skipped off into the night,' the article said.
  Just over a week later, the ax-man with bunny ears was spotted again about a block away from where the first sighting had occurred. This time he was standing on the porch of a newly constructed house, hacking away at a roof support.
  Here's how it was reported in the Washington Post :
  Paul Phillips, a private security guard for a construction company, said he saw the 'rabbit' standing on the front porch of a new, but unoccupied house. 'I started talking to him,' Phillips said, 'and that's when he started chopping.'
  'All you people trespass around here,' Phillips said the 'Rabbit' told him as he whacked eight gashes in the pole. 'If you don't get out of here, I'm going to bust you on the head.' Phillips said he walked back to his car to get to get his handgun, but the 'Rabbit,' carrying the long-handled ax, ran off into the woods.
  The mysterious 'Rabbit' of Guinea Road was never identified, caught, or questioned, nor was he ever seen again, so far as anyone knows, but there are good reasons to suppose that these sightings formed the genesis of the Bunny Man legend. Not only did the incidents occur in Fairfax County not far from the Colchester Overpass, not only did the perpetrator allegedly threaten people with an ax while dressed in a bunny costume, but these reports were published in 1970, almost exactly the same time the earliest known variants of the story began to appear.
  So, yes, the real-life events of some forty-odd years ago served as the basis for this tale, but the rest — not least any supposed connection between the Bunny Man and his namesake bridge — is pure embellishment. That's how a legend is made.

  In which we investigate the story of a 17-year-old girl allegedly pushed down a sewer and killed by a gang of bullies from her school. Her ghost has returned to wreak revenge on those who do not share it. Can any of this possibly be true?

  Example #1 : Text of MySpace.com post contributed by a reader, October 6, 2006:
  ------ Bulletin Message ------
  They pushed her down a sewer
  About 6 years ago in Indiana, Carmen Winstead was pushed down a sewer opening by 5 girls in her school, trying to embarrass her in front of her school during a fire drill. When she didn't submerge the police were called. They went down and brought up 17 year old Carmen Winstead's body, her neck broke hitting the ladder, then side concrete at the bottom. The girls told everyone she fell... They believed them.
  FACT: 2 months ago, 16 year old David Gregory read this post and didn't repost it. When he went to take a shower he heard laughter from his shower, he started freaking out and ran to his computer to repost it, He said goodnight to his mom and went to sleep, 5 hours later his mom woke up in the middle of the night cause of a loud noise, David was gone, that morning a few hours later the police found him in the sewer, his neck broke and his face skin peeled off.
  If you don't repost this saying 'She was pushed' or 'They pushed her down a sewer' Then Carmen will get you, either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.

  'Hi my name is Carmen Winstead. I'm 17 years old. I am very similar to you... Did I mention to you that I'm dead. A few years ago a group of girls pushed me down a sewer hole to try and embarrass me. When I didn't come back up the police came. The girls said that I had fell and everyone believed them. The police found my body in the sewer. I had a broken neck and my face was torn off. Send this message to 15 people after you read the whole message if you value your life! A boy called David received this message. He just laughed and deleted it. When he was in the shower he heard laughing... MY LAUGHTER! He got really scared, rushed to his phone to repost this message... But he was too late. The next morning his mum entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying, 'You will never have him back!' No one has found his body yet... because he is with me! A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people (10 more than required). I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger. Send this to 15 people in the next 5 minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's. Your time starts... NOW! The story is true you can research It on google'
  Analysis: Don't panic. I could find no public record of a teenage girl named Carmen Winstead who perished after being pushed down a sewer drain by bullying schoolmates — not in North America, at any rate, and certainly not within the past 50 years.
  That doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that no such thing ever happened, but it's reason enough to classify the tale as folklore , a cautionary tale , an urban legend .
  It's also a classic example of a chain letter , albeit one circulating in the form of shared Facebook posts and forwarded emails instead of snail mail, which is how chain letters were traditionally distributed before the advent of digital media. Like every chain letter since time immemorial, however, its primary goal is self-replication. The story is told in such a way as to persuade you to pass it along to your friends, so they'll pass it along to their friends, and so on, ensuring that the text continues to circulate.
  This particular chain letter relies on a supernatural threat — the promise of a painful death at the hands of Carmen Winstead's ghost — to goad recipients into passing it along. 'If you don't repost this saying 'They pushed her,'' the text warns, 'then Carmen will get you, either from the sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.'
  Are you scared yet? If so, you probably shouldn't read any of these other specimens of the ghost-story-chain-letter genre, because they're likely to frighten you even more...

"Premature Burial","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/buried_alive.htm","2016-01-17 21:32:02","  By David Emery
  As told by a reader...
  My great-great grandmother, ill for quite some time, finally passed away after lying in a coma for several days. My great-great grandfather was devastated beyond belief, as she was his one true love and they had been married over 50 years. They were married so long it seemed as if they knew each other's innermost thoughts.
  After the doctor pronounced her dead, my great-great grandfather insisted that she was not. They had to literally pry him away from his wife's body so they could ready her for burial.
  Now, back in those days they had backyard burial plots and did not drain the body of its fluids. They simply prepared a proper coffin and committed the body (in its coffin) to its permanent resting place. Throughout this process, my great-great grandfather protested so fiercely that he had to be sedated and put to bed. His wife was buried and that was that.
  That night he woke to a horrific vision of his wife hysterically trying to scratch her way out of the coffin. He phoned the doctor immediately and begged to have his wife's body exhumed. The doctor refused, but my great-great grandfather had this nightmare every night for a week, each time frantically begging to have his wife removed from the grave.

  Finally the doctor gave in and, together with local authorities, exhumed the body. The coffin was pried open and to everyone's horror and amazement, my great-great grandmother's nails were bent back and there were obvious scratches on the inside of the coffin.
  Analysis: Shades of Edgar Allan Poe ! It's a fact that once upon a time, before modern embalming techniques were in widespread use, people were found on rare occasions to have been buried alive — a circumstance that could not have been pleasant for anyone concerned, least of all the poor souls who woke up six feet under.
  Here's one grisly example of a real-life case of premature burial, as reported in the New York Times on January 18, 1886:
  It didn't help that medical science was slow to produce a reliable checklist of vital signs, nor that many doctors prior to the late 19th century were too poorly educated (or incompetent, or both) to tell a living body from a dead one.
  It is also a fact that something of a moral panic concerning premature burials took hold in parts of Europe and North American during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, the fervor of which was scarcely warranted by the facts. Historians surmise it may have been prompted by the medical discovery that victims of suffocation and drowning could be resuscitated — that, though they appeared dead, they really weren't. This must have been a disconcerting realization for many people at the time.
  In any case, so strong was the fear of 'precipitate interment' during the 19th century that some folks who had the means took to stipulating in their wills that their coffins be outfitted with signaling devices just in case. No one knows if any of these were ever actually put to good use.

  The parents take off, and soon she gets the kids into bed and goes to the room to watch TV. She tries watching TV, but she is disturbed by a clown statue in the corner of the room. She tries to ignore it for as long as possible, but it starts freaking her out so much that she can't handle it.
  She resorts to calling the father and asks, 'Hey, the kids are in bed, but is it okay if I switch rooms? This clown statue is really creeping me out.'
  The father says, seriously, 'Get the kids, go next door and call 911.'
  She asks, 'What's going on?'
  He responds, 'Just go next door and once you call the police, call me back.'
  She gets the kids, goes next door, and calls the police. When the police are on the way, she calls the father back and asks, 'So, really, what's going on?'
  He responds, 'We don't have a clown statue.' He then further explains that the children have been complaining about a clown watching them as they sleep. He and his wife had just blown it off, assuming that they were having nightmares.
  The police arrive and apprehend the 'clown,' who turns out to be a midget. A midget clown! I guess he was some homeless person dressed as a clown, who somehow got into the house and had been living there for several weeks. He would come into the kids' rooms at nights and watch them while they slept. As the house was so large, he was able to avoid detection, surviving off their food, etc. He had been in the TV room right before the babysitter right came in there. When she entered he didn't have enough time to hide, so he just froze in place and pretended to be a statue.
  — As told by a reader
  Analysis: Like ' The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs ,' this urban legend pits a lone teenage babysitter against a male intruder who has surreptitiously entered the house. It's disturbing on many counts, not least the hint of pedophilia in the revelation that the 'midget disguised as a clown' has been spying on, playing with, or, in some versions, actually touching someone's children before his presence in the house is discovered.
  In some variants — for example, this one submitted by a reader in 2006 — it's explicitly stated that the intruder is a sex offender with designs on the babysitter herself:
  Another variant circulating in the form of a chain letter ('if you don't repost to 10 peeps within 5 minutes,' the message warns, 'the clown will be standing next 2 your bed at 3:00 a.m. with a knife in his hand...') makes the 'midget clown' out to be a murderer who has escaped from prison:
  Though urban legends are sometimes inspired by real-life events, I've found no clear precedents for 'The Clown Statue' in news reporting of the past 20 years — no stories in which a miscreant poses as a clown doll inside people's homes, at any rate.
  In 1990, a West Palm Beach, Florida woman was shot and killed on her doorstep by a clown sporting a bright orange wig (a crime which remains unsolved, so far as I know). Then there's John Wayne Gacy , of course, who during the mid-1970s murdered 33 young men and buried their bodies under his Chicago home. The media christened him the 'Killer Clown' because he was known for hosting neighborhood parties at which he dressed up as a clown.
  It was probably the Gacy case and the publicity surrounding it that sparked a wave of 'phantom clown' sightings in 1981. The phenomenon, as documented by Loren Coleman in Mysterious America (Boston: Faber and Faber, 1983), originated in Boston with unconfirmed reports of men dressed as clowns trying to lure children into vans. Over the course of a few days, more reports of 'clown men in vans' bothering children came in, then more, and soon the sightings had spread to neighboring cities and towns.
  Eventually there were sightings reported in as many as 10 other states in various parts of the country. No abductions occurred, no arrests were made, indeed no evidence was ever found to substantiate any of these reports, nearly all of which had been made by children under 10 years old.
  Similar rumor outbreaks have occurred since the early '80s, and while 'The Phantom Clowns' and 'The Clown Statue' have little in common as narratives apart from a malevolent clown character, it's possible that the latter was inspired by the former.
  It's also possible that it was inspired, at least in part, by various horror films made over the past several decades. The 1982 movie Poltergeist contained scenes in which a very creepy clown doll terrorizes two young children in their bedroom. Stephen King's It , a 1990 TV movie, featured a child-killing monster called 'Pennywise the Dancing Clown.' Demonic clowns also drove the plots of Killer Klowns from Outer Space in 1988, and Clownhouse in 1990.
  In any case, an irrational fear of clowns is a recognized clinical phobia known as coulrophobia . It's more widespread than one might think, especially among children. A study conducted by the University of Sheffield in England found that all of the more than 250 children surveyed disliked clown images as part of the decor in hospitals.
  Even some of the older children in their mid-teens found the images frightening.
  'As adults we make assumptions about what works for children,' one of the authors of the study was quoted as saying. 'We found that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them frightening and unknowable.'
  That 'unknowability' the researcher speaks of may be the key to clowns' essential creepiness, not to mention the horror they're capable of evoking in movies and urban legends . We're accustomed to reading people's emotional states and motivations in their facial expressions. Who knows what evil might lurk beneath a clown's painted-on grin? Children do, apparently. Perhaps it's a lesson worth remembering.

"The Cadaver's Arm","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Cadaver-Arm.htm","2016-08-23 06:48:58","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Severed Arm'
  A friend of a friend knew this girl in nursing school named Sarah. Sarah was in that part of the program where they were dissecting corpses to study anatomy, and she was kind of squeamish — no, very squeamish — around the dead bodies. It wasn't that no one else nauseated by the experience; they were, but they were too 'cool' to let on. But one day Sarah just completely lost it and threw up in front the class. That's when some of the other students started picking on her.
  At some point a group of them got together and decided to play a prank on her. One day, when the anatomy professor wasn't looking, they removed a cadaver's arm and managed to sneak it out of the classroom in a backpack.
  There was a party at the dormitory that night, and everyone had a little too much to drink, even Sarah, who normally didn't imbibe that much. She decided to go to bed early, so went back to her dorm room alone, washed up, and got into bed in the dark.

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  She froze. She felt something cold and rubbery and wet in the bed with her. She flipped on the light and saw the severed, bloody cadaver arm that the other girls had placed there. She began to scream, and kept on screaming, and couldn't stop.
  When the other girls got to her room, they found Sarah, white as a ghost and laughing maniacally while gnawing on the severed arm.
  She spent the rest of her life in an insane asylum.
  Analysis: There are umpteen variations of this story, including one wherein the pranksters attach the severed cadaver's arm to a light cord in the victim's dorm room, so the first thing she does when she enters the dark room is reach up and grab it. And scream bloody murder, of course.
  In other versions the severed arm prank is supposedly a sorority initiation rite. Most often the pranksters are girls, but sometimes they're all boys, or a mix of both genders. In every case the victim is female.
  'The Cadaver Arm' is actually quite old and well-traveled, dating back as far as the turn of the 20th century. A version of it is recounted, for example, in the Spanish novel The Tree of Knowledge , the English translation of which was published in 1928:
  There was a story of a second-year student who had played the following prank on a friend, who, he knew, was rather timid. He took a dead mans arm, wrapped it in his cloak and went up to greet his friend.
  'How do you do?' he said, putting out the hand of the corpse from beneath his cloak.
  'Well, and you?' — answered the other and shook his hand but shuddered at the coldness of it — and was horrified when he saw the arm of a dead man coming out from the cloak.
  Many more variants, most from the late 1960s and early 1970s, can be found in the Indiana Folklore Collection on the website of the Wabash Valley Visions & Voices Digital Memory Project.

"The Choking Doberman","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dogs/a/chokingdoberman.htm","2015-03-12 16:24:39","  By David Emery
  As told by Lisa Foley...
  My cousin and his wife lived in Sydney with this huge doberman in a little apartment off Maroubra Road. One night they went out for dinner and a spot of clubbing. By the time they got home it was late and my cousin was more than a little drunk. They got in the door and were greeted by the dog choking to death in the loungeroom.
  My cousin just fainted, but his wife rang the veterinarian, who was an old family friend of hers, and got her to agree to meet her at the surgery. The wife drives over and drops off the dog, but decides that she'd better go home and get her hubby into bed.
  She gets home and finally slaps my cousin into consciousness, but he's still drunk. It takes her almost half an hour to get him up the stairs, and then the phone rings. She's tempted to just leave it, but she decides that it must be important or they wouldn't be ringing that late at night. As soon as she picks up the phone, she hears the vet's voice screaming out:

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  'Thank God I got you in time! Leave the house! Now! No time to explain!' Then the vet hangs up.
  Because she's such an old family friend, the wife trusts her, and so she starts getting the hubby down the stairs and out of the house. By the time they've made it all the way out, the police are outside. They rush up the front stairs past the couple and into the house, but my cousin's wife still doesn't have a clue what's going on.
  The vet shows up and says, 'Have they got him? Have they got him?'
  'Have they got who?' says the wife, starting to get really pissed off.
  'Well, I found out what the dog was choking on – it was a human finger.'
  Just then the police drag out a dirty, stubbly man who is bleeding profusely from one hand. 'Hey Sarge,' one of them yells. 'We found him in the bedroom.'
  Analysis: 'The Choking Doberman' has circulated in more or less this form for at least three decades, on as many continents. In his book of the same title, folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand cites a plethora of known variants, including a British version dating back to 1973. The legend became hugely popular in the United States during the early 1980s. It was published as an allegedly firsthand account in an American tabloid called The Globe in 1981, though subsequent research revealed that the pseudonymous author ('Gayla Crabtree') had actually heard the story secondhand in a beauty parlor.
  Folklorists believe 'The Choking Doberman' is a descendant of a much older (perhaps as old as the Renaissance) European folktale about a clumsy thief whose hand is either injured or amputated while committing a crime, marking him as the perpetrator. Among other interpretations it can be read as a 'just deserts' tale in which the criminal, as a result of his own actions, undergoes a punishment appropriate to the crime.

"They Hurt Her (The Death of David Gregory)","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/internet-scares/ss/David-Gregory-Death.htm","2016-02-07 18:02:15","  Description: Chain letter / Ghost story / Internet hoax Circulating since: 2006 Status: False
  Analysis: Not to be confused with the still-living TV journalist of the same name, the David Gregory of Internet fame is a fictional character who allegedly died at the hands of a vengeful ghost named Carmen Winstead .
  Winstead herself supposedly died after being pushed down a sewer drain by a gang of bullies from her school and suffering a broken neck.
  According to an online chain letter circulating since 2006, Winstead returned from the dead to take revenge on her tormentors, killing them one by one before turning her murderous attention to those who failed to share the story of how she died. The hapless David Gregory was one of them.
  '16-year-old David Gregory read this post and didn't repost it,' an addendum to the chain letter claims. 'He said good night to his mom and went to sleep, but five hours later, his mom woke up in the middle of the night from a loud noise and David was gone. A few hours later, the police found him in the sewer, with a broken neck and the skin on his face peeled off.'
  Why, exactly, his skin was peeled off is never explained.
  Carmen Winstead is a classic ghost story chain letter (see below for more specimens). It's also an example of creepypasta , an Internet phenomenon consisting of brief horror stories, videos, and creepy images shared online and via social media. Creepypasta is a subcategory of copypasta (as in 'copy and paste').
  In the case of the David Gregory story, a fragment snipped from a larger text (the Winstead chain letter) has taken on a life of its own thanks to social media.
  There is no reason to believe, of course, that the story of Carmen Winstead is true, in whole or in part, nor that a teenager named David Gregory (or any other human being in the real world, for that matter) has had his neck broken and skin peeled off as punishment for failing to repost a chain letter. It's just a ghost story, the only real point of which is to scare you enough to get you to pass it along to someone else.

Three days later, a well-fed crocodile is captured nearby. Naturally, 'Ole Mose' is an immediate suspect in the disappearance.

  Example: Email contributed by a reader, February 26, 2000:
  FW: Read story first before opening picture.
  You must read this and see the picture at the end. It is just crazy.... This is a true story from Palm Beach, Florida (the proof is at the end, but read the story first).
  The first foursome of the day played together to the 5th hole where one impatient golfer went ahead of the group. The remaining three finished their round and headed for the nineteenth hole to meet their less-patient friend. However, he wasn't there...and was no where to be found. Since his car was still in the parking lot, the threesome waited two hours.
  Thinking the impatient golfer might still be somewhere out on the course, they notified the clubhouse and the search was on. Of course, the impatient golfer was not located, but his clubs were found on the hole. Three days later, Ole Mose was spotted on the seventh hole and was an immediate suspect.
  Ole Mose was an American crocodile that was an infrequent course visitor for over 20 years. Not too much concern was ever given Ole Mose, as he had always made a hasty retreat whenever he saw anyone coming. To make a long story even longer, after the course officials, SPCA, lawyers, citizens groups, the mayor, Palm Beach PD, and the American Crocodile Association of Southern Florida agreed, it was decided that, in order to put everyone's mind at ease, Ole Mose should be unzipped.
  Take notice to what the man standing over Ole Moses is holding.

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: Zoologist and crocodile expert Adam 'He Oughta Know' Britton tells us the email tale is fake but the photo is real. According to Britton, the incident captured on film couldn't have happened in Florida.
  How does he know? Simple. The particular species of crocodile in the image, Crocodylus porosus , is native to Indonesia. It's not found in Florida. Plus, says Britton, there has never been a crocodile-caused fatality in Florida (though alligator attacks are a different story ).
  The photograph was taken in Kalimantan (Borneo) in 1997. Nothing else is known about it. The email story was attached anonymously in July 1998 and the two have circulated together ever since.
  For a clue as to how such a tasteless joke might have come about, look no further than the fact that alligators are not only plentiful in Florida, but are frequently sighted on golf courses. Tourists have even been bitten on occasion. Our email author was evidently aware of this, but made the mistake of confusing alligators with their cousins, the crocodiles — of which there are only a few hundred left in Florida and none at all north of the Everglades.
  Even so, the story rings true for enough many readers that a West Palm Beach hotel and golf course called the Breakers, whose name is mentioned in one popular version of the email, complains of receiving a steady stream of credulous phone calls from the day the story first appeared. 'I compare this prank to tabloid journalism,' a spokesperson for the resort complained to reporters. 'When you're at the top of the heap, someone wants to knock you down.'
  The reputation of the endangered American crocodile hasn't exactly benefited from the hoax, either.

"Do They Eat Babies in China?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/eating_babies.htm","2016-04-09 16:42:43","  Dear Urban Legends:
  I received an email last week which was quite disturbing and, to say the least, disgusting. It is about dead babies that can be bought from hospitals in Taiwan for $70 to meet the high demand for grilled and barbecued babies!
  I am sure this must be a hoax, although the message comes with an attached slide show, showing how the baby is prepared, cooked and eaten.
  Could you please investigate?
  Dear Reader:
  Given the nature of the 'evidence' — namely, tabloid-style rumor-mongering and unsourced images circulating on the Internet — we must proceed under the assumption that the Chinese as a people, whether on the mainland or in Taiwan, are no more inclined to eat human children than folks in other parts of the world.
  The same holds true for Jews, Christians, 'Gypsies,' witches, aborigines, Satanists, and all the other ethnic and religious groups accused of practicing this bloody 'custom' down through the centuries. There's simply no evidence that it exists, or has ever existed, anywhere on the planet. The burden of proof is on those who claim otherwise.
  The notion that killing and eating human babies or fetuses is an accepted practice within certain groups is essentially a modern version of an ancient form of bigotry known as ' blood libel ,' which consisted, historically, of one group accusing another of murdering infants in ritual sacrifices. The Greeks accused the Jews of doing it; the Romans accused the Christians of doing it; according to the Christians, it really was the Jews who did it — and so on, since time immemorial.
  Sociologists say the driving forces behind such ideas are ignorance, xenophobia (fear of 'the other') and psychological projection (attributing perceived moral failings of one's own group to others). As an example of the latter, it has been speculated that the spread of horror stories in the West about the supposed use of unborn babies as food in Asia may be fueled by qualms about social practices closer to home — practices such as abortion, for example, and the so-called 'cannibalization' of fetal tissue for scientific research.
  In any case, it's difficult to tell — and under dispute — whether photographs circulating online since December 2000 which appear to show an Asian man cooking and eating a human fetus are real or fake. We do know, thanks to documentation provided on Chinese-Art.com, that they were the work of a conceptual artist named Zhu Yu. The photos were exhibited at an underground art show after being rejected as 'too controversial' by curators of the Shanghai 2000 Bienniale. For those who haven't seen them and aren't too squeamish to take a peek, here are two examples from Zhu's postmodern performance piece, aptly titled 'Eating People,' collected from forwarded emails:
  The artist himself, whose past accomplishments include an opus called 'Canned Human Brains,' has claimed in interviews that he used real aborted fetuses stolen from a medical school to create the piece, and that he actually cooked and ate the fetuses 'for art's sake.'
  Should we take him at his word? Not necessarily.
  It is true — to the point of being a cliche, in fact — that avant-garde artists will say and do anything to shock their audiences, so we're obliged to acknowledge the possibility that Zhu Yu is telling the truth — that he really did cook and eat human fetuses in front of a camera.
  On the other hand, they don't call the kind of work Zhu does performance art for nothing, and it has been argued that he may have constructed his 'fetuses' out of doll parts and animal carcasses, pretended to consume them in front of a camera and issued tongue-in-cheek statements to the press claiming he was actually eating human flesh.
  That's a theory I'm inclined to support, because, frankly, if Zhu's claims were factual he'd probably be serving jail time right now. There's no reason to suppose the government of China is any more tolerant of cannibalism than governments anywhere else. The fact that Zhu's work was rejected for inclusion in an state-run exhibition bears that out.
  By his own 'admission,' the fetuses Zhu allegedly cooked and ate were obtained illegally, thus, if he is telling the truth, he could be prosecuted as an accomplice in that crime, as well.
  In early 2001, a Malaysian tabloid published several of Zhu's photos in conjunction with a story alleging that the signature dish of a particular Taiwanese restaurant contains the 'meat' of human infants. Taiwan government officials immediately demanded a retraction — a de facto confirmation that baby eating is not particularly well-accepted by the Chinese.
  Shortly afterward, the same pictures turned up on a prominent website specializing in tasteless content (www.rotten.com), prompting reports in the British press that Scotland Yard and the FBI were investigating their origins.
  The owner of said website maintains he has never been contacted by authorities from any country, however. As of August 2001, the photos were still on display there.

  Its just like from an alien movie be very careful when u get caught with dust.... as following pics will show effects of bad dust to a person.

  Again he dismissed it as the constant rubbing and that it will go away. The days go by the swelling of his eye got worse, redder and bigger.... till he decided to go and see a doctor for a check up.
  The doctor immediately wanted an operation, being afraid of a tumor growth or cyst. At the operation, what was thought to be a growth or cyst, actually turned out to be a live worm..... what was thought initially to be just mere dust actually was an insect's egg...... because of that, my friends, if u do get caught in dust, and the pain persists, pls go see a doctor immediately...... thank you....

  Description: Viral images and text Circulating since: Nov. 2002 Status: Images are authentic; the story not so much
  Analysis: Bizarre as it may seem, the photos above are authentic, though the same cannot be said of the accompanying text, which is an utter fabrication.
  There's no way to determine who assembled the collage, which has circulated anonymously since 2002, but I did manage to locate the source of the individual images, an article entitled 'Anterior Orbital Myiasis Caused by Human Botfly,' published in the July 2000 edition of the Archives of Ophthalmology , a journal of the American Medical Association.
  Myiasis is the medical term for a maggot (fly larva) infestation of a living body. In this case, the patient was a 5-year-old boy treated by U.S. Air Force surgeons in a rural area of the Republic of Honduras. 'The respiratory pore of a late-stage larva of the human botfly ( Dermatobia hominis ) was located in the anterior orbit,' says the article abstract. 'The larva was gently removed under general anesthesia through a small incision in the conjunctiva.'
  That is to say, the patient had a worm in his eye. Doctors put him under and removed it through a small incision on the surface of his eyeball. Apparently, the patient was none the worse for wear in the aftermath.
  It would appear that the journal article itself was not consulted at all when the email tale above was composed. Neither 'bad dust' nor excessive eye rubbing are cited by the authors as causes of the larva infestation in the 5-year-old patient. It resulted from contact with insects.
  According to entomologists, the human botfly lays its eggs on the bodies of other insects (such as mosquitoes), which then transfer the eggs to animal or human hosts by direct contact. When a botfly egg hatches, the larva burrows into the host's skin (or, in this case, eye) head-first and begins feeding.
  This nasty creature is found mainly in Central and South America, but there are other species of flies known to responsible for cases of myiasis in North America, mainly blowflies. According to an epidemiological study conducted in 2000, most instances of myiasis acquired in the U.S. resulted from blowflies laying their eggs in pre-existing wounds.
  None of which is quite as terrifying as the claim that any one of us could end up with an eye worm simply by being exposed to too much dust — which helps explain why the true facts of the case aren't circulating with the photos. In folklore, the story's the thing. Accuracy takes a back seat to the emotional impact of the narrative; or, as folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand succinctly puts it, 'The truth never stands in the way of a good story.'

  Also known as 'The Spider in the Hairdo' and 'The Deadly Hairdo'
  A very stylish teenage girl grew tired of spending hours carefully 'ratting' (teasing) and spraying her hair to attain an extreme beehive do. She washed her hair in sugar-water, allowing it to harden in the style she wanted. At night, she carefully wrapped a towel around it and slept on a special half-pillow designed not to disturb the hair.
  One morning she failed to come down for breakfast. Her mother went to her room only to find her dead in bed. When the towel was removed from her head, it was discovered that she had been gnawed to death by rats (or bugs — I've heard both versions).

  My mother grew up in Ostersund, Sweden. When she was in her early teens, when beehive hairdos were popular, she was told about a girl in her school who wrapped her hair around bread dough to achieve maximum height to her beehive.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  — As told by reader Jen Rasi
  There's this guy who you might have seen walking around town with two huge dreadlocks, one on each side of his head. One day he decides to get them cut off. So he's off to the hair dresser, and of course they can't get the clippers through his hair, so out come the biggest pair of scissors you've ever seen.
  They start to hack into one of the dreads and get about halfway through when he starts screaming and runs out of the shop. His girlfriend finds him dead in their flat the next day.
  The coroner found that a nest of red-backed spiders had moved into his hair and started biting him when the scissors cut the nest to bits.
  — As told by reader Joel Harvey
  Please take caution. Pass this along to your friends and family. Must Read!
  Something terrible happened to a 10 yr. old girl who had braids. The little girl had been wearing her braids in a ponytail for the longest and apparently the braids were old, at least 2 to 3 months old, and the mother never took them down to wash them or let them air out or anything.
  Anyway, the girl had been complaining about having a headache for approximately two weeks to her mother who just brushed it off, assuming that she had hit her head against the wall or something. Well one morning the child again complained to her mother about having a headache while getting ready for school. Again the mother brushed her off. When the child got to school, she told her teacher that her head was hurting. The teacher assumed that the braids were too tight in the child's hair and attempted to let the ponytail down. When she removed the hair piece and let the braids loose, there was a spider in the childs hair.
  The spider had laid eggs in the childs hair and the spiders were eating her scalp. The child was rushed to the hospital were she later died.
  This happened in Monroe, La. It was all over the news and in the papers for about a week or two. Please, parents, don't leave braids, or any kind of hair extensions in childrens or your own hair no more than 2-3 weeks.

  Okay, maybe ants in your brain or a pus-filled tumor in your chicken sandwich give it a run for its money, but this urban legend about spider eggs hatching in a girl's unwashed hairdo is guaranteed to give you shivers.
  The most familiar versions of the creepy-crawly tale date from the early 1960s when 'beehive' hairdos were popular, but believe it or not there's at least one version dating back as far as the thirteenth century. In her 1976 paper, 'Three Medieval Tales and their Modern American Analogues' (reprinted in J.H. Brunvand's Readings in American Folklore , W.W. Norton: 1979), Shirley Marchalonis shares this ecclesiastical rendition:
  Marchalonis continues: 'The high school girl with the nest of spiders in her hair offends contemporary standards of behavior just as the proud medieval ladies offended contemporary belief. In both cases the story acts as warning and example.'
  That's the very definition of a cautionary tale .
  I should add that the forwarded email variant quoted above, which centers around a 10-year-old girl with unwashed braids, touches on another popular theme in contemporary folklore just now: parental neglect .

"The Exploding Cactus","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/cactus.htm","2015-01-15 20:04:55","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Spiders in the Cactus' and 'The Spider in the Yucca'
  Example #1: As told by reader Ileen Verble...
  A woman goes to buy a large cactus from a nursery, and brings it home. Later that day she notices something very odd. The cactus appears to be breathing! She calls the nursery she purchased the cactus from and says, 'I know this sounds crazy, but I think my cactus is breathing.'
  The woman she is speaking to tells her to immediately get out of the house, and that she (the nursery woman) is going to call the bomb squad. The bomb squad comes to the house and loads the cactus into a van. Just as they get it into the van, the cactus explodes and out come thousands of scorpions!
  It seems that several scorpions had laid their eggs in the cactus, and they all hatched at once.
  Example #2: As told by reader Carolyn Lamb...
  There was once a lady who lived in a house by herself. She had a lot of potted plants. One day, she noticed that the skin on the cactus in her living room was moving. It gave her the creeps, but then it stopped. She decided she must have imagined it.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Later that day, she was talking to one of her friends. She mentioned how her cactus had been moving. 'Oh my god!' said her friend. 'Get everything alive out of your house and seal it up. Now!'
  The lady was puzzled, but she did what her friend had told her. No sooner had she finished sealing all the doors and windows when the cactus exploded. Thousands and thousands of baby tarantulas came out and filled her whole house.
  Her cactus had had tarantula eggs in it!!!
  Example #3: As told by reader B.J. Hill...
  It seems that a family was given a gift of a gorgeous cactus. (Or perhaps they bought it — I don't know.) At any rate, they took it home and gave it a place of honor in the dining room.
  They soon noticed an interesting phenomenon — the cactus appeared to be 'breathing.' In-out, in-out, ever so slightly moved the sides of the huge plant. At first the family thought nothing of it, but then the father or mother or some other responsible soul decided to check it out with the local nursery.
  A telephone call was placed and the 'breathing' described. The nurseryman shrieked in horror, and told the father (mother, other responsible soul) to 'GET THE CACTUS OUT OF THE HOUSE, GET IT OUT NOW!' And Father (or whoever) dropped the phone and complied, racing to get the plant out into the yard.
  When he took it outside the cactus EXPLODED and hundreds (thousands, tens of thousands) of baby spiders erupted from the interior of the (now defunct) houseplant.
  Analysis: 'The Spider in the Yucca,' as this tale was known early on, first popped up in Scandinavia during the 1970s and migrated to other parts of the world, including the U.S., soon afterward. The southwestern decor fad breathed new life into the legend during the early '90s, when it also became fashionable to peg Ikea stores as purveyors of the infested houseplants.
  As to the veracity of the story, there's no reason to believe any such thing ever happened. According to an arachnid expert contacted by the Seattle Times , no spider or tarantula species are known to burrow into plants. Even if they did lay eggs inside a cactus (or any other) plant, the expert said, it wouldn't 'explode.'
  The story bears obvious similarities to ' The Fatal Hairdo ,' in which a vain young woman refuses to wash her hair for fear of messing up her towering beehive hairdo (or braids, or dreadlocks in other versions) and ends up with a nest of newly-hatched spiders on her head.
  Jan Harold Brunvand covered this urban legend extensively in his 1993 collection, The Baby Train .

"The Fatal Tan","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/accidentsmishaps/a/fatal_tan.htm","2015-07-16 14:31:50","  By David Emery
  As told by Kayla Pruett...
  This one was told to me by a former co-worker. And who knows — here in the south, home of fake tans and big hair, it might have happened!
  A young woman was approaching her wedding day. She decided that she'd look better in her wedding dress if she had a little color, so a week before the wedding she went to a tanning salon. The salon staff, however, told her that for her own safety, she could only tan for thirty minutes a day. After she'd tanned for her thirty minutes, she decided it wasn't enough, so she went to another tanning salon the same day to tan. They told her the same thing. She still wasn't tan enough after that thirty minutes, so she went to a third tanning salon, and a fourth.
  She did this for the next four days. Even though she was getting a little bit red, she kept thinking how good she'd look in her wedding dress.
  The day before her wedding she was found dead. Her internal organs had all burnt up from the tanning beds.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: This well-traveled story, delightfully retold by reader Kayla Pruett, inspired the title of Jan Harold Brunvand's third collection of urban legends , Curses, Broiled Again! There are many versions out there, but this is everyone's favorite — a bride-to-be who is so intent on looking fantastic at her wedding that she ignores every safety warning and cooks herself to death on a series of tanning beds.
  The moral here is the same as that of ' Spiders in the Hairdo ' — vanity kills. Interestingly, it's not enough in either story that the victim ultimately dies for her 'sins.' She must die a particularly gruesome, painful death! It's the horrific details, in part, that keep some of these old legends alive.
  We have no good reason to think that anything like what's described in this legend ever really happened. Quite the opposite. No one has ever had their internal organs 'cooked' or 'broiled' or 'burnt up' in a tanning booth. Why not? Because it's physically impossible. The ultraviolet rays emitted by these devices can seriously burn your skin if you overdo it — so don't — but unlike, say, a massive, prolonged dose of microwave radiation, they could not possibly cook you 'from the inside out.'

"Why Is Friday the 13th Considered Unlucky?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th.htm","2017-01-09 16:27:30","  I have before me the abstract of a 1993 study published in the British Medical Journal provocatively titled, 'Is Friday the 13th Bad for Your Health?' Its authors compared the ratio of traffic volume to the number of automobile accidents on two different dates, Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th, over a period of years in hopes of mapping 'the relation between health, behavior, and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom.'
  Interestingly, they found that while consistently fewer people in the region sampled chose to drive their cars on Friday the 13th, the number of hospital admissions due to vehicular accidents was significantly higher than on Friday the 6th.
  Their conclusion?
  'Friday 13th is unlucky for some. The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent.
  Staying at home is recommended.'
  Paraskevidekatriaphobics — those afflicted with a morbid, irrational fear of Friday the 13th — will be pricking up their ears about now, buoyed by evidence that the source of their unholy terror may not be so irrational after all. It's unwise to take solace in the results of a single scientific study, however, especially one so peculiar. Surely these statistics have more to teach us about human psychology than the ill-fatedness of any particular date on the calendar.
  The sixth day of the week and the number 13 both have foreboding reputations said to date from ancient times. Their inevitable conjunction from one to three times a year portends more misfortune than some credulous minds can bear.
  According to phobia specialist (and coiner of the term paraskevidekatriaphobia ) Dr. Donald Dossey, it's the most widespread superstition in the United States today. Some people refuse to go to work on Friday the 13th; some won't dine in restaurants; many wouldn't think of setting a wedding on that date.
  So, how many Americans at the beginning of the 21st century actually suffer from this condition? According to Dossey, the figure may be as high as 21 million. If he's right, no fewer than eight percent of Americans remain in the grips of a very old superstition.
  Exactly how old is difficult to say, because determining the origins of superstitions is an inexact science, at best. In fact, it's mostly guesswork.
  LEGEND HAS IT: If 13 people sit down to dinner together, one will die within the year. The Turks so disliked the number 13 that it was practically expunged from their vocabulary (Brewer, 1894). Many cities do not have a 13th Street or a 13th Avenue. Many buildings don't have a 13th floor. If you have 13 letters in your name, you will have the devil's luck (e.g., Jack the Ripper , Charles Manson , Jeffrey Dahmer , Theodore Bundy , and Albert De Salvo all have 13 letters in their names). There are 13 witches in a coven .
  
  Though no one can say for sure when and why human beings first associated the number 13 with misfortune, the superstition is assumed to be quite old, and there exist any number of theories purporting to trace its origins to antiquity and beyond.
  It has been proposed, for example, that human fears surrounding the number 13 are as ancient as the act of counting.
  Primitive man had only his 10 fingers and two feet to represent units, this explanation goes, so he could count no higher than 12. What lay beyond that — 13 — was an impenetrable mystery to our prehistoric forebears, hence an object of superstition.
  Which has an edifying ring to it, but one is left wondering: did primitive man not have toes?
  Despite whatever terrors the numerical unknown held for their hunter-gatherer ancestors, ancient civilizations weren't unanimous in their dread of 13. The Chinese regarded the number as lucky, some commentators note, as did the Egyptians in the time of the pharaohs.
  To the ancient Egyptians, they say, life was a quest for spiritual ascension which unfolded in stages — twelve in this life and a thirteenth beyond, thought to be the eternal afterlife.
  The number 13 therefore symbolized death, not in terms of dust and decay but as a glorious and desirable transformation. Though Egyptian civilization perished, this account continues, the symbolism conferred on the number 13 by its priesthood survived, albeit corrupted by subsequent cultures who came to associate 13 with a fear of death instead of a reverence for the afterlife.
  Still other sources speculate that the number 13 may have been purposely vilified by the founders of patriarchal religions in the early days of western civilization because it represented femininity. Thirteen is said to have been revered in prehistoric goddess-worshiping cultures because it corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year (13 x 28 = 364 days). The 'Earth Mother of Laussel,' for example — a 27,000-year-old carving found near the Lascaux caves in France often cited as an icon of matriarchal spirituality — depicts a female figure holding a crescent-shaped horn bearing 13 notches. As the solar calendar triumphed over the lunar with the rise of male-dominated civilization, so did the 'perfect' number 12 over the 'imperfect' number 13, thereafter considered anathema.
  One of the earliest concrete taboos associated with the number 13 is said to have originated in the East with the Hindus, who apparently believed, for reasons I haven't been able to ascertain, that it is always unlucky for 13 people to gather in one place — say, at dinner. Interestingly enough, precisely the same superstition has been attributed to the ancient Vikings (though I've also been told that this and the accompanying mythographical explanation of it are of questionable authenticity). That story has been laid down as follows:
  Twelve gods were invited to a banquet at Valhalla. Loki, the Evil One, the god of mischief, had been left off the guest list but crashed the party anyway, bringing the total number of attendees to 13. True to character, Loki incited Hod, the blind god of winter, to attack Balder the Good, who was a favorite of the gods. Hod took a spear of mistletoe offered by Loki and obediently hurled it at Balder, killing him instantly. All Valhalla grieved. And although one might take the moral of this story to be 'Beware of uninvited guests bearing mistletoe,' the Norse themselves apparently concluded that 13 people at a dinner party is just plain bad luck.
  As if to prove the point, the Bible tells us there were exactly 13 present at the Last Supper. One of the dinner guests — er, disciples — betrayed Jesus Christ, setting the stage for the Crucifixion.
  Did I mention the Crucifixion took place on a Friday?
  LEGEND HAS IT: Never change your bed on Friday; it will bring bad dreams. If you cut your nails on Friday, you cut them for sorrow. Don't start a trip on Friday or you will encounter misfortune. Ships that set sail on a Friday will have bad luck, as in the tale of H.M.S. Friday . One hundred years ago, the British government sought to quell the longstanding superstition among seamen that setting sail on Fridays was unlucky. A special ship was commissioned and given the name 'H.M.S. Friday.' They laid her keel on a Friday, launched her on a Friday, selected her crew on a Friday, and hired a man named Jim Friday to be her captain. Finally, it was on a Friday that H.M.S. Friday embarked on her maiden voyage — and was never seen or heard from again.
  
  Some say Friday's bad reputation goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden. It was on a Friday, supposedly, that Eve tempted Adam with the forbidden fruit. Adam bit, as we all learned in Sunday School, and they were both ejected from Paradise. Tradition also holds that the Great Flood began on a Friday; God tongue-tied the builders of the Tower of Babel on a Friday; the Temple of Solomon was destroyed on a Friday; and, of course, Friday was the day of the week on which Christ was crucified.
  It is therefore a day of penance for Christians.
  In pagan Rome, Friday was execution day (later Hangman's Day in Britain), but in other pre-Christian cultures it was the sabbath, a day of worship, so those who indulged in secular or self-interested activities on that day could not expect to receive blessings from the gods — which may explain the lingering taboo on embarking on journeys or starting important projects on Fridays.
  To complicate matters, these pagan associations were not lost on the early Church, which went to great lengths to suppress them. If Friday was a holy day for heathens, the Church fathers felt, it must not be so for Christians — thus it became known in the Middle Ages as the 'Witches' Sabbath,' and thereby hangs another tale.
  The name 'Friday' was derived from a Norse deity worshiped on the sixth day, known either as Frigg (goddess of marriage and fertility), or Freya (goddess of sex and fertility), or both, the two figures having become intertwined in the handing down of myths over time (the etymology of 'Friday' has been given both ways).
  Frigg/Freya corresponded to Venus, the goddess of love of the Romans, who named the sixth day of the week in her honor ' dies Veneris .'
  Friday was actually considered quite lucky by pre-Christian Teutonic peoples, we are told — especially as a day to get married — because of its traditional association with love and fertility. All that changed when Christianity came along. The goddess of the sixth day — most likely Freya in this context, given that the cat was her sacred animal — was recast in post-pagan folklore as a witch, and her day became associated with evil doings.
  Various legends developed in that vein, but one is of particular interest: As the story goes, the witches of the north used to observe their sabbath by gathering in a cemetery in the dark of the moon. On one such occasion the Friday goddess, Freya herself, came down from her sanctuary in the mountaintops and appeared before the group, who numbered only 12 at the time, and gave them one of her cats, after which the witches' coven — and, by 'tradition,' every properly-formed coven since — comprised exactly 13.
  The astute reader will have observed that while we have thus far insinuated any number of intriguing connections between events, practices and beliefs attributed to ancient cultures and the superstitious fear of Fridays and the number 13, we have yet to happen upon an explanation of how, why, or when these separate strands of folklore converged — if that is indeed what happened — to mark Friday the 13th as the unluckiest day of all.
  There's a very simple reason for that: Nobody really knows, and few concrete explanations have been proposed.
  One theory, recently offered up as historical fact in the novel The Da Vinci Code , holds that the stigma came about not as the result of a convergence, but because of a catastrophe, a single historical event that happened nearly 700 years ago.
  That event was the decimation of the Knights Templar , the legendary order of 'warrior monks' formed during the Christian Crusades to combat Islam. Renowned as a fighting force for 200 years, by the 1300s the order had grown so pervasive and powerful it was perceived as a political threat by kings and popes alike and brought down by a church-state conspiracy, as recounted by Katharine Kurtz in Tales of the Knights Templar (Warner Books, 1995):
  There are problems with the 'day so infamous' thesis, however, not the least of which is that it attributes enormous significance to a relatively obscure historical event. Even more problematic for this or any other theory positing pre-modern origins for a superstitious dread of Friday the 13th is the fact that so little documentation has been found to prove that such a superstition even existed prior to the late 19th century.
  Going back more than a hundred years, Friday the 13th doesn't even merit a mention in the 1898 edition of E. Cobham Brewer's voluminous Dictionary of Phrase and Fable , though one does find entries for ' Friday, an Unlucky Day ' and ' Thirteen Unlucky .'  When the date of ill fate finally does make an appearance in later editions of the text, it is without extravagant claims as to the superstition's historicity or longevity. The very brevity of the entry is instructive: 'Friday the Thirteenth: A particularly unlucky Friday. See Thirteen ' — implying that the extra dollop of misfortune might be accounted for in terms of a simple accrual, as it were, of bad omens:
  That being the case, we're guilty of perpetuating a misnomer by labeling Friday the 13th 'the unluckiest day of all,' a designation perhaps better reserved for, say, a Friday the 13th on which one breaks a mirror, walks under a ladder, spills the salt, and spies a black cat crossing one's path; a day, if there ever was one, best spent in the safety of one's own home with doors locked, shutters closed, and fingers crossed.
  In 13: The Story of the World's Most Popular Superstition (Avalon, 2004), author Nathaniel Lachenmeyer argues that the commingling of 'unlucky Friday' and 'unlucky 13' took place in the pages of a specific literary work, a novel published in 1907 titled — what else? — Friday, the Thirteenth . The book, all but forgotten now, concerned dirty dealings in the stock market and sold quite well in its day. Both the titular phrase and the phobic premise behind it — namely that superstitious people regard Friday the 13th as a supremely unlucky day — were instantly adopted and popularized by the press.
  It seems unlikely that the novelist, Thomas W. Lawson, literally invented that premise himself — he treats it within the story, in fact, as a notion that already existed in the public consciousness — but he most certainly lent it gravitas and set it on a path to becoming the most widespread — or at least the most widely known — superstition in the modern world.

  Photo caption: As shared on Facebook, Oct. 24, 2012:
  Analysis: The photo above is presumably authentic — structures like this really exist — but the caption is entirely false. The wrought-iron 'cage' covering the grave site is actually known as a mortsafe .
  Mortsafes were invented in the early 1800s to keep grave robbers out, not the 'undead' in.
  This overview of mortsafes and their intended function is from the December 19, 1896 issue of The Hospital , a British medical journal:
  Alas, these extraordinary measures, though 'probably highly effective' in protecting graves, according to Dr. Martyn Gorman of the University of Aberdeen, were only available to the rich. The scourge of body snatching continued in England and Scotland until public outrage drove Parliament to pass the Anatomy Act of 1832, which legalized the use of donated or unclaimed bodies for anatomical dissection, rendering the stolen corpse trade — and mortsafes — superfluous and obsolete.
  As for any purported connection between the use of mortsafes and vampires and zombies, the notion that a fear of the 'undead' was so rife in Victorian England that people would have taken extraordinary measures to defend against them is not merely wrong, but wrongheaded to boot. Educated Britons were indeed familiar with the concept of vampirism via popular literature and scholarly discussions, but in the main it appears they regarded the belief in blood-sucking fiends risen from the grave as a quaint superstition peculiar to foreigners. The word zombie and its associated superstitions originated in West Africa and Haiti, and were all but unknown in the English-speaking world until popularized in books and films of the early twentieth century.

"The Hook","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/the_hook.htm","2016-05-30 23:50:03","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Hook Man'
  A teenage boy drove his date to a dark and deserted lovers' lane for a make-out session. He turned on the radio for mood music, leaned over to whisper in the girl's ear, and began kissing her.
  Minutes later, the mood was broken when the music suddenly stopped mid-song. After a moment of silence an announcer's voice came on, warning in an ominous tone that a convicted murderer had just escaped from the state insane asylum — which happened to be located within a half-mile of where they were parked — and urging that anyone who notices a man wearing a stainless steel hook in place of his missing right hand should immediately report his whereabouts to the police.
  The girl became frightened and asked to be taken home. The boy, feeling bold, locked all the doors instead and, assuring his date they would be safe, attempted to kiss her again. She became frantic and pushed him away, insisting that they leave. Relenting, the boy peevishly jerked the car into gear and spun its wheels as he pulled out of the parking space.

  When they arrived at the girl's house she got out of the car, and, reaching to close the door, began to scream uncontrollably. The boy ran to her side to see what was wrong and there, dangling from the door handle, was a bloody hook.
  Analysis: Folks have been telling the hook-man story since the 1950s, and indeed the implicit moral message — 'Sex is naughty; bad boys and girls will be punished!' — seems more appropriate to that simpler, more naive era. Just as this message has come to be parodied in recent horror films (whereas, once upon a time, it was delivered with morbid solemnity), its 'bygone' relevance has taken the teeth out of the cautionary tale .
  Remarking on the improbable tidiness of the plot of 'The Hook,' folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand observed that 'most tellers narrate the story nowadays more as a scary story than a believed legend.' Small wonder. Given its exploitation by Hollywood in popular genre films like Candyman and I Know What You Did Last Summer , most people under the age of 30 probably assume the story was invented by screenwriters.
  Folklorists of a more Freudian bent find meaningful sexual overtones in the imagery of the tale. The boy, who wants to get his 'hooks' into the girl, is not only frustrated by her unwillingness but afraid of his own lustful impulses — a fear heightened by the stern 'voice of conscience' emitting from the radio — and has to 'pull out fast' before a deadly sin is committed. The tearing off of the madman's hook symbolizes castration. Proponents of this type of psychological interpretation find the sexual apprehensions of both boys and girls represented in the legend.
  One of the earliest appearances of 'The Hook' in print was in a 'Dear Abby' column dated Nov. 8, 1960:
  DEAR ABBY: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me:
  A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite 'lovers' lane' to listen to the radio and do a little necking. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple became frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the car door for her. Then he saw — a hook on the door handle! I don't think I will ever park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids.
  Not all urban legends in this vein have a safe and happy ending, I should point out. See ' The Boyfriend's Death ' for an example of a similar cautionary tale that pulls no punches. If you dare...

  Also known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag,' 'The Knife in the Briefcase,' or 'The Assailant in Disguise'
  Example: As told by Huw Llewelyn-Jones:
  I first heard this story in 1980 in North Wales. I believed it until I was told it again a matter of days later. It is usually told as happening to a friend or relative.
  A young woman returns to her car from a day's shopping. She had parked her car in the town's multi-story car park.
  As she approaches the car she notices someone sitting in the back seat. She cautiously checks the registration plate to see if it is indeed her car, as it is a popular model and color. The car is indeed hers, and as she gets closer she sees that it's an old woman sitting in the back seat.
  She asks the woman how and why she is sitting in her car.
  The old woman replies that she had been shopping with her son and family but felt unwell and returned to the car to rest. She obviously had mistaken the young woman's car for her son's, as it was the same model and color. The old woman then asks to be driven to a hospital, as she is still feeling unwell. The young woman agrees.

  As she gets into the driver's seat something makes her very nervous about the situation and she asks the old woman if she is feeling well enough to direct her as she reverses the car out of the parking place. The old woman agrees, gets out of the car and proceeds to direct the reversing maneuver.
  As soon as the young woman has the car out of the parking space she speeds out of the car park, leaving the old woman stranded. She then drives straight to the nearest police station and reports the incident.
  A police officer then searched the car and found an axe concealed under the driver's seat.
  The young woman had had a lucky escape!
  Analysis: The tale of hairy-armed hitchhiker goes back to the early 1800s in England. In those days, the disguised axe murderer was said to have awaited his victim in the back seat of a horse-drawn carriage. More recently the legend has resurfaced with the malefactor posing as good samaritan whose briefcase just happens to be stuffed with deadly weapons.
  Two hundred years old and still going strong, proof that a great story never dies.

  Analysis: There are many different kinds of chain letters , but all of them have the same basic purpose, namely to persuade readers to copy and share them with as many other people as possible. Some promise good luck, blessings, riches, or long life for passing them along. Others threaten misfortune, curses, poverty, or even death for not. In this case the threat is murder at the hands of the eyeless, bloody ghost of a 7-year-old child. Judging by how frequently this chain letter has been copied and shared, the ploy is extraordinarily effective.
  Typically, there's some attempt made at a narrative (see links to examples below), but not here. Teddy's self-description implies he met a violent, unpleasant death and intends to make others suffer as he did if he doesn't get his way. I think we can safely say this is a chain letter written by and for adolescents. To everyone else it's purely a nuisance.
  Here are more examples of ghost story chain letters:
  Carmen Winstead ' If you don't repost this saying 'She was pushed' or 'They pushed her down a sewer' then Carmen will get you, either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.'
  A Little Girl Called Clarissa 'On a Monday night at 12:00 she creeps into your room and kills you, but slowly and painfully, slowly cutting different parts of your body then watches you bleed to death. If you don't send this to 20 people by midnight she'll be coming to kill you! '
  The Clown Statue 'The children and the babysitter got murdered by the clown. It turned out 2 be that the clown was a killer that escaped from jail. If you don't repost to 10 peeps within 5 minutes the clown will be standing next 2 your bed at 3:00 am with a knife in his hand. '
  The Ghost Under the Bed 'People in Laredo, Texas received this image and did not send it and were killed outside a bar; it looked as if this woman killed them. Send it to five people or the woman will look for you .'
  Humans Can Lick, Too 'If you delete this letter you will suffer the same fate as the girl in the story did, years after the dog was killed. She was raped and killed in the same town and same house as the dog. Do not dismiss this letter, because if you do, a horrible thing will become of you , everyone will soon know your name.'

  Also known as 'The Licked Hand,' 'The Dog's Lick,' 'People Can Lick, Too,' 'Not Only Dogs Can Lick,' etc.
  Example #1 As told by U.K. reader Kirsty H....
  Once there was a nice old lady who had a lovely little dog. One day, the old lady heard on the radio that a crazy murderer had escaped from jail and that she should lock all her doors and windows. So she locked every door and window in the house except one tiny one to let some air in. She thought that a murderer would never get in through there.
  So that night she went to bed as usual. She knew everything was okay because when she put down her hand the dog licked it. But later in the night she heard a drip , drip , drip . She put her hand down and the dog licked it and everything was okay, so she went downstairs to check out the tap. But the tap wasn't dripping. So she went to bed again. And everything was okay. She woke up again later in the night, though, so she thought the dripping sound must be coming from the shower. She went into the bathroom, and there was her dog, dead, hanging in the shower, dripping with blood, all its intestines hanging out.

  Written on the mirror was: 'Humans can lick, too!' And behind her in the mirror, she saw the murderer.
  Example #2 Viral text circulating online as of May 2001...
  Subj: DON'T DELETE THIS!!! (it scared the crap outta me) Once there was a a beautiful young girl who lived in a small town just south of Farmersburg. Her parents had to go to town for a while, so they left their daughter home alone, but protected by her dog, which was a very large collie. The parents told the girl to lock all the windows and doors after they had left. And at about 8:00pm the parents went to town. So doing what she was told the girl shut and locked every window and every door. But there was one window in the basement that would not close completely. Trying as best as she could she finally got the window shut, but it would not lock. So she left the window, and went back upstairs. But just to make sure that no one could get in, she put the dead-bolt lock on the basement door. Then she sat down had some dinner and decided to go to sleep for the night. Settling down to sleep at about 12:00 she snuggled up with the dog and fell asleep. But at one point, she suddenly woke up. She turned and looked at the clock...it was 2:30. She snuggled down again wondering what had woken her.....when she heard a noise. It was a dripping sound. She thought that she had left the water running, and now it was dripping into the drain of her sink. So thinking it was no big deal she decided to go back to sleep. But she felt nervous so she reached her hand over the edge of her bed, and let the dog lick her hand for reassurance that he would protect her. Again at about 3:45 she woke up hearing dripping. She was slightly angry now but went back to sleep anyway. Again she reached down and let the dog lick her hand. Then she fell back to sleep. At 6:52 the girl decided that she had had enough...she got up just in time to see her parents were pulling up to the house. 'Good,'she thought. 'Now somebody can fix the sink...'cause I know I didn't leave it running.' She walked to the bathroom and there was the collie dog, skinned and hung up on the curtain rod. The noise she heard was its blood dripping into a puddle on the floor. The girl screamed and ran to her bedroom to get a weapon, in case someone was still in the house.....and there on the floor, next to her bed she saw a small note, written in blood, saying: HUMANS CAN LICK TOO, MY BEAUTIFUL. Now it is time for you to lock all the windows and doors. This letter is the only chain letter that is true. This did happen many years ago, and the man who killed the dog was never caught. If you delete this letter you will suffer the same fate as the girl in the story did, years after the dog was killed. She was raped and killed in the same town and same house as the dog. Do not dismiss this letter, because if you do, a horrible thing will become of you, everyone will soon know your name. But only because it will be the headline of your local newspaper for a long time. It will read... Small Town Murder On The Loose! You can not chance your luck on a chain letter so serious as this. Give up your chance to send this letter to 23 people and you will be giving up your chance to live. You were warned. I hope that I will not see any murder stories in the papers anytime soon. And now I bid you a good day. And one more thing... you only have 23 minutes... sorry.
  Analysis: 'Humans Can Lick, Too' is another handwriting-on-the-wall tale in the same vein as ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? ' and ' Welcome to the World of AIDS .'
  The trope derives from a Bible story (book of Daniel) in which a feast thrown by the pagan Babylonian King Belshazzar is interrupted by the specter of a disembodied hand scrawling a cryptic message on the wall. As ultimately interpreted by the prophet Daniel, the message conveys God's judgment, predicting the downfall of Belshazzar and his entire kingdom. To 'read the handwriting on the wall' is to foresee one's own impending doom — an apt and chilling metaphor.
  Note that the chain letter format (second variant above) does little to enhance the impact of the story; in point of fact, the directive to 'pass this along or die' undermines the narrative by transporting it to some fantasy realm where murderous madmen are capable of stalking their victims via forwarded email. That aside, the email retelling follows a tried-and-true formula, and works.
  Variants of 'Humans Can Lick, Too' were being collected by folklorists as long ago as the late 1960s. Indeed, the chain-letter version appears to have been cribbed from a 1967 oral transcription published in Ronald L. Baker's Hoosier Folk Legends (Indiana University Press, 1982). As in the later variant, the events were said to have taken place near a small town called Farmersburg, though there were two female protagonists instead of one, and the note left by the murdering madman read as follows:
  'I'm coming to see you. I had my chance once before, but I didn't take it. Not only dogs can lick.'
  This is the very definition of a cautionary tale .

"The Killer in the Backseat","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/killer_backseat.htm","2015-09-18 14:38:30","  By David Emery
  As told by reader Emily Dunbar:
  One night a woman went out for drinks with her girlfriends. She left the bar fairly late at night, got in her car and onto the deserted highway. After a few minutes she noticed a lone pair of headlights in her rear-view mirror, approaching at a pace just slightly quicker than hers. As the car pulled up behind her she glanced and saw the turn signal on — the car was going to pass — when suddenly it swerved back behind her, pulled up dangerously close to her tailgate and the brights flashed.
  Now she was getting nervous. The lights dimmed for a moment and then the brights came back on and the car behind her surged forward. The frightened woman struggled to keep her eyes on the road and fought the urge to look at the car behind her. Finally, her exit approached but the car continued to follow, flashing the brights periodically.
  Through every stoplight and turn, it followed her until she pulled into her driveway. She figured her only hope was to make a mad dash into the house and call the police. As she flew from the car, so did the driver of the car behind her — and he screamed, 'Lock the door and call the police! Call 911 !'

  When the police arrived the horrible truth was finally revealed to the woman. The man in the car had been trying to save her. As he pulled up behind her and his headlights illuminated her car, he saw the silhouette of a man with a butcher knife rising up from the back seat to stab her, so he flashed his brights and the figure crouched back down.
  The moral of the story: Always check the back seat!
  Analysis: In another common variant of this legend, the imperiled female (and it's always a female, please note) pulls into a gas station and is frightened by the odd behavior of the attendant, who keeps trying to get her to leave the car and join him in the office. It turns out he has glimpsed a knife-wielding murderer in the backseat and is trying to save her life!
  Folklorists have traced the legend back to the 1960s and believe it may have been inspired by a vaguely similar real event in 1964 involving the discovery by a New York City policeman of an escaped murderer hiding in the backseat of his (the cop's) own car.
  'The Killer in the Backseat' was among the legendary horror stories dramatized in the 1998 film Urban Legend . Let us not assume, however, that real-life evildoers never lie in wait for their victims in the backseats of vehicles. As reported in the Decatur Daily News on September 14, 2007, a female college student in Alabama was threatened by a man with a gun who popped up suddenly in the backseat of her SUV. She escaped, fortunately, by slamming on the brakes and bolting from the car.

"Another Close Call at the Mall","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/Another-Close-Call-At-The-Mall.htm","2016-08-23 06:49:48","  We explore the case of the murderous good samaritan who never leaves home without a knife, rope, and duct tape in the trunk of his car  the Internet version of a classic shopping mall horror story!
  Description: Forwarded email / Urban Legend Circulating since: July 1998 (this version) Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by a reader, July 1998:
  Analysis: Horrifying, if true. Which it's not. It is an urban legend, and hardly a new one at that (see ' The Knife in the Briefcase ' and ' The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker ' for older variants).
  For weeks after the above story began circulating on the Internet in 1998, however, security personnel at Tuttle Crossing Mall in Columbus, Ohio fielded call after call after call from panicked patrons and scoop-hungry media types, nearly all of whom seemd to assume the story was at least based on a real-life event.
  It wasn't.
  'It's not true!' was the constant refrain at the mall switchboard during that time. The security office issued a statement saying no such incident had ever been reported. Columbus police investigated and said they found no evidence to substantiate the story.
  'It was nothing but a false, stupid, ridiculous, sick rumor,' an on-duty security guard told me when I called the mall to verify the story in July 1998. He was relieved when the rumor seemed to be dying down in April, he said, then became audibly perturbed when I told him it was back with a vengeance and had dozens of forwarded emails to prove it.
  'Trust no one'
  Other versions circulating concurrently  including variants set in Milpitas, California and Savannah, Georgia  featured only slight modifications. 'FYI - Ladies Beware!' began one specimen of the email. 'Be safe, Beware...' warned another. At least one variant concluded with this cautionary warning:
  A fairy tale for adults
  'Trust no one.' That's the moral, explicit or implied, of a good many popular urban legends, including such classics as ' The Kidney Snatchers ,' a chilling tale of doping and dismemberment at the hands of a global cabal of organ reapers. The persistent message is that it's a dangerous and terrifying world out there, one in which any stranger, well-dressed or otherwise, might have a knife (or a scalpel) concealed in his briefcase with which he plans to do us bodily harm.
  Apocryphal stories like these  essentially fairy tales for adults  tap into deep-seated, universal fears that are at once rational and irrational. There are dangerous people in the world, to be sure. Wisdom dictates behaving cautiously around strangers depending on the circumstances. These are givens. On the other hand, it's surely a rare and unlikely occurrence to be accosted at shopping malls by well-tailored businessmen with arsenals hidden in their briefcases.
  Beyond the cautionary tale
  Just because these stories take the form of cautionary tales with a gripping moral message doesn't mean they have anything truly useful to teach us about the world. Taken with a grain of salt, it may serve as a useful reminder to pay attention to our surroundings and guard against potentially threatening people and situations, but 'Trust no one' is hardly a practical credo to live by.
  We oughtn't conduct our lives as if every stranger is a potential axe-murderer because, among other reasons, it simply isn't the case.
  No, if urban legends teach us anything at all, they teach us about ourselves and how we perceive the world. They're a window on human psychology, exposing some of our deepest fears, wishes and resentments.
  Consider the Tuttle Mall story in particular. It's improbable in its particulars and demonstrably untrue, yet has been widely taken for fact and circulated from friend to friend to friend across the U.S. and around the world as a deadly serious warning to all women. It doesn't prove that that there are madmen lurking in parking lots everywhere, nor that our lives are in grave peril when we accept the help of strangers. It doesn't prove that every time we set foot outside our homes we ought to be afraid.
  What it does prove, by its very existence, is that we are already afraid.

"The Knife in the Briefcase","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/The-Knife-In-The-Briefcase.htm","2016-08-23 06:49:35","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag' or 'The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'
  Example #1 As told by a reader:
  One summer day in Southampton, New York, a woman pulled into a gas station. As the attendant pumped gas, the woman told him she was in a hurry to pick up her daughter, who had just finished an art class in East Hampton.
  A very well-dressed man walked over to her car and started talking to her. He explained that his rental car had died, and he needed a ride to East Hampton for an appointment. She said she would be happy to give him a ride. He put his briefcase in the backseat and said he was going to the men's room quickly.
  The woman looked at her watch and suddenly panicked. She drove off quickly, forgetting that the man was coming back to the car for a ride.
  She thought nothing of him again until she and her daughter pulled into their driveway. She saw his briefcase and realized she had forgotten him! She opened it looking for some form of identification so she could notify him about his belongings. Inside she found nothing but a knife and a roll of duct tape!

  Example #2 As told by a reader:
  A young woman was leaving a local shopping mall, only to find that she had a flat tire. A well-dressed young man carrying a briefcase came up to her and asked if she needed help. She told him she would call AAA, but when she did she was told it would be over an hour before a truck would be dispatched to her site. The gentleman urged her to let him fix her flat and she finally allowed him to do so.
  When he was finished, he asked if she would give him a ride to the other side of the mall, as his car was parked there. Looking at her watch, she realized how late it was and apologized to the young man saying that she needed to get home as it was her daughter's birthday and her husband was at home with the two children awaiting her arrival. The man went on his way.
  When she got home, she told her husband what had happened at the mall and about the man who came to her aid. The husband went out to look at the tire and saw that the man had inadvertently left his briefcase in the trunk of the vehicle. He brought it into the living room and they opened it to see if they could find the man's name and phone number.
  Upon opening the briefcase, they found only five items: a rag, chloroform, duct tape, a body bag and an ice pick (which was probably used to cause the flat tire ).
  Analysis: A newer version of this urban legend dating from 1998 was set in the parking lot of an actual, specific shopping center in Columbus, Ohio, the Tuttle Crossing Mall. According to local police and mall officials, however, no such incident ever took place there.
  Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand refers to the story as 'one of the most common and most fully analyzed of all contemporary legends,' which is partly a function of its age. A variant known as 'The Hatchet in the Handbag' (or ' The Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker ') dates back to the horse-and-buggy era. In that version, a driver consents to give a ride to an elderly woman who turns out, upon closer examination, to have extremely hairy arms — she's a man in disguise! Justifiably panicked, the driver invents a ruse to get the 'woman' out of his vehicle and speeds off to safety, only to discover a handbag left behind in the passenger seat containing just one item: a hatchet.
  Every variant of this cautionary tale shares the 'close call' motif — the driver, always a lone female, nearly falls into the clutches of a would-be assailant but escapes just in time . In some versions she senses a tell-tale sign of danger — the old woman's man-like arms, for example, or, in the Tuttle Mall variant, the good samaritan's creepy insistence on being driven across the parking lot after he fixes the driver's flat tire. In other versions, including as the ones retold above, the driver escapes due to pure happenstance — she suddenly recalls a pressing appointment and speeds off before the assailant can climb into the car. Either way, the close call is an obligatory narrative turn, else who would be left to (supposedly) tell the tale?

"The Killer in the Window","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Killer-in-the-Window.htm","2015-01-12 17:54:00","  By David Emery
  Also known as: 'The Face in the Window' and 'The Killer's Reflection'
  Example #1 As told by reader Destinee (Aug. 25, 2000):
  This girl was home all alone watching TV on a cold winter night. The television was right beside a sliding glass door, and the blinds were open.
  Suddenly she saw a wrinkled old man staring at her through the glass! She screamed, then grabbed the phone next to the couch and pulled a blanket over her head so the guy couldn't see her while she called the police. She was so terrified that she remained under the blanket until the police got there.
  It had snowed a lot during the day, so the police naturally decided to look for footprints. But there were no footprints at all on the snowy ground outside the sliding door.
  Puzzled, the police went back inside the house – and that's when they saw the wet footprints on the floor leading up to the couch where the girl was still sitting.
  The policemen looked at each other nervously. 'Miss, you're extremely lucky,' one of them finally said to her.

  'Why?' she asked.
  'Because,' he said, 'the man wasn't outside at all. He was in here, standing right behind the couch! What you saw in the window was his reflection.'
  Example #2 As posted online (May 29, 2010):
  A 15 year old girl was babysitting her little sister while her parents went out to a party. She sent her sister off to bed around 9:30 while she stayed up to watch her favorite T.V. show.
  She sat in her recliner with a blanket and watched until it went off at around 10:30, after it went off she turned around in her seat to face the big glass door and watch the snow fall. She sat there for about 5 minutes or so when she noticed a strange man walking toward the glass from outside. She sat there staring as he stared at her back. He started to pull a shiny object out from his coat. Thinking it was a knife she immediately pulled the covers over her head. After about 10 minutes she removed the covers and saw that he was gone. She then called 911 and they rushed over.
  They examined outside for any footprints in the snow, but there were none to be found. Two cops walked into her house to tell her the bad news and they noticed a trail of big wet footprints leading up to the chair where she was sitting.
  The cops came to their conclusion and immediately told the girl she was very lucky because the man she saw staring at her was not standing outside, but he was standing behind her and what she saw was his reflection.
  Analysis: This chilling variation on the familiar trope of the threatened babysitter (see also ' The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs ' and ' The Clown Statue ') makes effective use of the 'shocking reveal' -- our protagonist learns after the fact that the prowler hadn't been watching her from outside the house as she had assumed; but was inside the house the whole time, making her close call with the boogeyman all the closer, and all the more horrifying in retrospect.
  As in 'The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs,' the cautionary message of this tale is aimed at the teenage protagonist: stay alert, be careful, mind your responsibilities. The consequences of distraction can be dire. 'The moment that the sitter relaxes (eat a snack and watch TV) and lets her guard down,' notes Simon J. Bronner in American Children's Folklore (August House, 1988), 'is when dangers lurk.'
  But though the babysitter's main job is to protect the children (and in some variants of these tales the children are killed), it's the young woman whose safety is directly threatened, a motif that links 'The Killer in the Window' to other close-call-with-intruder narratives like ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light ' and ' Humans Can Lick, Too .' Subtextually, these stories convey a decidedly more retro message than the one mentioned above, namely that young woman set themselves up to be victims merely by going about their business unchaperoned. For better or worse (surely the former), they no longer pack the moral punch they once may have had.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  My name is Todd and I currently reside in London, England, though I grew up in various regions of Canada (mainly the east coast). I am fascinated by urban legends and the manner in which they seem to breed. The reason for this email is to inquire whether or not you have encountered the story I am about to reveal. I wish to know if it holds any roots of fact or if it's simply a story passed on to frighten babysitters around the world.
  When I was about 14 and living in Ottawa, Canada there was a story circulating about a babysitter who, after putting the children to bed, heard the washing machine or dryer turn on for a brief period and then turn off again.
  Now, the laundry room was situated on the ground floor of this split-level home. At first she thought nothing of it, until it turned on again and then off again. She thought perhaps it was just a strange washing cycle and the parents had forgotten to turn it off.
  She proceeded down the stairs to investigate when suddenly the washer/dryer turned on again. She paused on the stairs until it turned off. She was now overcome with fear and decided to go wake the children upstairs, afterwards proceeding out the back patio door over to the neighbors' house.

  The neighbors thought she was over-reacting but they called the police anyway. The police arrived to investigate and discovered a man standing in the laundry room holding a knife. Apparently he was waiting for the babysitter to investigate the noises.
  Okay, now that I've actually told the story it seems absurd that it might be based in truth, but I would like to know if you have heard this before, or variations of it. Thank you very much for your time.
  Dear Reader: Your story bears more than a passing resemblance to ' The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs ,' an urban legend in which a teen babysitter receives threatening phone calls from a man who, come to find out, is calling her from inside the house she's babysitting in. The main difference between them is that in the upstairs version the intruder taunts his intended victim as a prelude to attacking her; in the downstairs version the intruder makes noises to lure his intended victim into the basement.
  'The Laundry Room Killer' isn't as well known as 'The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs,' but there are several  variants of it in circulation. In the oldest one I've found so far , dated 1997, the babysitter hears a tapping noise coming from the basement which turns out to be the serial killer tapping his knife on the dryer. In a 2011 variant , the the babysitter supposedly hears 'the dryer ding bell thing' go off in the basement and calls the kids' parents to ask if they left any laundry in the dryer -- which, of course, they hadn't. Another version posted online in 2012 says the would-be killer 'had been putting rocks in the dryer to try to lure someone downstairs.'
  Like most urban legends about babysitters — and there are many — 'The Laundry Room Killer' emphasizes the vulnerability not only of the young, inexperienced females we typically picture doing this job, but of their charges, the children, as well. It's a cautionary tale aimed at parents, not just teenage girls.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  What truth is there behind these ' Darwin Award ' winners? I never seem to read anywhere else about these awards for human stupidity except via email. In particular, the 1998 round has an especially troublesome story (see below). Seems to me that there are a lot of clues to its possible fictitious origins. Either way, I'd love to know if you have heard anything about this or other 'Darwin Award' winner stories.
  Truth may be stranger than fiction, but some things are just too strange:
  FLAGSTAFF, AZ: A pre-med student from the University of Arizona was looking to score big with his date on a Friday night. Determined to put the girl in the mood, he drove her up to a spot on Mount Lemmon which overlooked the city of Tucson. They walked to an open knoll where they could see the city lights.
  Overcome by the romantic locale, she succumbed to his pleas and they stripped down, made a bed of their clothes, and passionately began making love. The heavy storm clouds rolling overhead and the low rumble of thunder inside them excited the lovers even more. At the first few flashes of lightning, they never looked up to see the charred remains of once great trees.
  Their idyllic clearing was a hotbed of electrical activity during the warm desert nights. With a blinding light, a bolt of lightning struck the high point on the knoll, which happened to be the pre-med student's ass, and sought the path of least resistance --- straight down! Incredibly, he survived, but was in excruciating pain. The heat of the lightning had fused together flesh and latex so that the lovers were now stuck together like a pair of dogs. The girl, unfortunately, did NOT survive the lightning strike!
  When the student looked down into the vacant eyes of his girlfriend and realized she was dead, his immediate repulsion caused him to jerk away from her, which of course, he couldn't! A wave of pain and nausea made him vomit into the girl's face and open mouth! Heaving only caused more pain and repeated vomiting until he finally passed out.
  Attracted by the smell of 'food,' a bear found its way to the Siamese lovers and began to lick semi-digested pizza and buffalo wings from the dead girl's face. The student came to, but when he saw the bear, there was little he could do but lay there silently in fear. To his horror, the bear became dissatisfied with just a lick and started to eat the girl, loudly crunching her facial bones only inches from his ear. The bear also tasted the student, scraping the back of his skull with its teeth, before moving on.
  Around mid-morning a group of junior girl scouts, up for a fun weekend camp-out, arrived at the campsite where the pre-med student's car was parked. It was only a matter of minutes before three screaming girls discovered the student, who had regained consciousness several times in the night and had managed to drag himself and the partially-eaten girl about 20-feet.
  Doctors managed to 'successfully' separate the student from the corpse, but Mr. Happy looked like a small piece of cauliflower in its flaccid state. The first hint of arousal resulted in so much pain, that the student was unable-- -and unwilling- --to achieve an erection. Future surgeries may produce a reasonably functioning penis, but the student's family jewels, referred to by the doctors as the 'scrotum mass,' are irreparable.
  Although most Darwin Awards are supposed to be won posthumously, we think this guy deserves consideration since he successfully removed himself from the gene pool .

  Dear Reader:
  From a storytelling point of view, I must say that if the discoverers of these lightning-fused lovers hadn't turned out to be a troop of girl scouts, the tale would have sucked me in long enough to bother researching it. But this and other details are just too clever, too perfect, too good to be true. I give it a thumbs-up for humor and a thumbs-down for credibility.
  For those who don't know what the Darwin Awards are, they're yearly prizes given out posthumously ( by definition ) to 'individuals who have given their all in an effort to improve our gene pool ... who have made the ultimate sacrifice of killing themselves by the most extraordinarily stupid means.'
  The joy of the Darwin Awards (and their only real point) lies in the hilarity of the nominated stories. It hardly matters who wins the actual prize. In fact, the yearly announcement is always somewhat anticlimactic.
  As to their general credibility, it's a mixed bag. The Awards first surfaced years ago as a sort of spontaneous creation of the internet and were highly unreliable then, with no single body, self-appointed or otherwise, to authenticate the stories or officially crown the winners. Eventually, two 'official' Darwin Awards sites appeared on the web, one at darwinawards.com and the other (now defunct) at officialdarwinawards.com.
  As you might surmise, there ensued domain name bickering and skirmishes over ownership of material between the two, but one service both sites have tried earnestly to provide is the sorting out of the false stories from the true. The surviving site still does a reasonably good job of it.
  Even so, the internet being what it is, it remains the case that anyone can make up a story, declare it a Darwin Awards nominee (or even a winner) and circulate it to their heart's content, regardless of whether it meets the agreed-upon criteria or any standards of authenticity.
  Such is the case with the present example, which achieved the honor of being posted on darwinawards.com in 1998 — but as an ' urban legend ,' not a Darwin Award winner.

"The Mistletoe Bough","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/classics/a/The-Mistletoe-Bough.htm","2015-12-22 04:38:49","  By David Emery
  'The Mistletoe Bough,' lyrics by Thomas Haynes Bayly , music by Sir Henry Bishop , is a ballad composed around 1830 retelling a traditional tale about a newlywed bride who accidentally locks herself in an old oak trunk while playing hide-and-seek with members of her wedding party, who then spend a long night searching for her in vain.
  Though the legend on which it was based had undoubtedly been circulating for quite some time before the lyrics were written, it's thought that the direct inspiration for Bayly's rendition was ' Ginevra ' from Samuel Rogers' Italy, a Poem , published in 1822. Also known by the titles 'The Mistletoe Bride,' 'The Missing Bride,' 'The Lost Bride,' and 'Bride-and-Seek,' versions of the age-old story are still told and sung today .
  THE MISTLETOE BOUGH
  The mistletoe hung in the castle hall, The holly branch shone on the old oak wall; And the baron's retainers were blithe and gay, And keeping their Christmas holiday. The baron beheld with a father's pride His beautiful child, young Lovell's bride; While she with her bright eyes seemed to be The star of the goodly company.

  Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  'I'm weary of dancing now,' she cried; 'Here, tarry a moment — I'll hide, I'll hide! And, Lovell, be sure thou'rt first to trace The clew to my secret lurking-place.' Away she ran — and her friends began Each tower to search, and each nook to scan; And young Lovell cried, 'O, where dost thou hide? I'm lonesome without thee, my own dear bride.' Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  They sought her that night, and they sought her next day, And they sought her in vain while a week passed away; In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot, Young Lovell sought wildly — but found her not. And years flew by, and their grief at last Was told as a sorrowful tale long past; And when Lovell appeared the children cried, 'See! the old man weeps for his fairy bride.' Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.
  At length an oak chest, that had long lain hid, Was found in the castle — they raised the lid, And a skeleton form lay mouldering there In the bridal wreath of that lady fair! O, sad was her fate! — in sportive jest She hid from her lord in the old oak chest. It closed with a spring! — and, dreadful doom, The bride lay clasped in her living tomb! Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough.

  Example #4: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 10, 2012:
  Analysis: As ghost stories go, this one is slight and more preposterous than most, but that hasn't dampened its success as an Internet chain letter . As of this writing, a Google search yields 60,000-plus postings of the text since 2008, most of them attributable, it appears, to gullible adolescents.
  'Clarissa' shares the same basic aim of all chain letters, namely self-reproduction. These copy-and-share texts promise everything from good luck, free money, or philanthropic beneficence on the positive side, to threats of misfortune, calamity, and even painful death on the negative, all in the cause of manipulating recipients into sharing them as quickly and as widely as possible.
  In common with others of its ilk, the 'Clarissa' chain letter is especially insidious in that it targets young social media users and encourages them to repost the text randomly and repeatedly in comment threads on sites like Facebook and Google Plus, interrupting conversations and rankling other users. I hate to scold, but this is just bad manners.
  Chain letters don't have magical powers. Ten-year-old 'Clarissa' never existed. It goes without saying that her ghost isn't going around killing people who fail to share this stupider-than-most chain letter. Think before you share!

"The Necrophiliac's Gift","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/necrophiliac.htm","2015-05-28 15:57:31","  By David Emery
  I returned from a brief vacation to find a message in my inbox from Tor Strand, a reporter for the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang .
  'In our country,' he began, 'there is a story going wild among people these days...'
  Oh, boy, here it comes, I thought. He's going to tell me that Scandinavian gangbangers are firing on innocent drivers who flash their headlights at oncoming vehicles. It's happening everywhere else , you know.
  Instead, Mr. Strand surprised and delighted me by recounting the following tale, which he assumed to be an urban legend :
  continue reading below our video
  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  How romantic!
  Strand informed me that precisely the same thing is alleged to have happened in at least a half-dozen Norwegian towns — a strong indication that his assumption is correct: it's an urban legend.
  Diagnosis: myiasis of the vagina
  That said, it's worth noting that the phenomena described aren't completely beyond the bounds of medical possibility. Maggot infestations of living human tissues do occur. The scientific term for it is ' myiasis .' There have even been recorded cases of myiasis of the female sexual organs, though these are extremely rare.
  One case in particular caught my attention as I scanned the medical literature. In the abstract of a study entitled ' Vulvar Myiasis ,' published last year in Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology , researchers summarized 'the case of a 19-year-old pregnant girl diagnosed with vulvar myiasis and concomitant syphilis, vaginal trichomoniasis and genital candidiasis.' Oh, and she also tested positive for HIV.
  The diagnosis of a maggot infestation of the vulva combined with with four common venereal diseases suggests that the myiasis may have been sexually transmitted, too –- another nod toward the plausibility of Tor Strand's Norwegian horror story. One would think the odds against the survival of fly eggs on or in the gentleman's penis between the time of his necrophilic adventure and his encounter with the female protagonist of the story would be quite high, but apparently it's not out of the question.
  'The Bad Date'
  Still, when we find precisely the same story popping up in different places and marked by subtle differences in the telling, it's fair to conclude we're dealing with some type of folklore , even when it's conceivable there's a factual basis for it. Tor Strand made reference to six or seven variants. I can cite yet another: ' The Bad Date ,' shared by Øystein Skundberg in an online discussion in 1998:
  Boy breaks up with girl, who in her despair picks up a man at a bar, comes home with him, and has casual, unprotected sex. After some days, she experiences bad itch in her crotch. The girl goes to a medical doctor, which upon examining her looks very serious and concerned, says nothing, but gives her an appointment with a specialist. Girl off to specialist. He/she examines the girl, turns very grave, makes some notes, and tells her that she will have the results of the test in a week.
  The bewildered girl goes home. The next week, the police turns up on her doorstep to question her. When she ask why, they explain that the police is routinely contacted by doctors in every case of corpse-worm.
  The Skundberg variant employs a classic storytelling device: the three visits. In this example, proper diagnosis of the patient's condition is twice postponed, even though the condition should be perfectly obvious to the first doctor she sees. This is for dramatic effect. Doctor #1 examines her and appears 'concerned,' but refers her to a specialist. The specialist evinces a similar 'grave' reaction, but tells the patient she'll have to wait two weeks for test results. Our poor protagonist remains in the dark about her affliction until she's visited a week later by a policeman, who nonchalantly informs her that doctors routinely report all cases of 'corpse worm' to the authorities. Gasp!
  Maggots and metaphors
  Even if it stretches credulity, a well-honed horror story is bound to be a hit, and this one has clearly caught on in Norway. Its popularity may also stem from the fact that it can serve as a poignant and frightful metaphor for the dangers of indulging in unprotected sex in the age of HIV and AIDS. Maggots, which feed on carrion, have long been a literary symbol for death. In the present narrative, casual intercourse with a stranger leads to a carrion-like condition of the genitals — a symbolic brush with death through the act of sex. The imagery is powerful and disturbing, the moral perfectly suited to the times.
  I doubt we've heard the last of this one.

"The Russian Sleep Experiment","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/internet-scares/fl/Russian-Sleep-Experiment.htm","2016-11-22 21:57:10","  By David Emery
  Synopsis: Toward the end of the 1940s, Soviet researchers sealed five prison inmates in an airtight chamber and dosed them with an experimental stimulant gas to test the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation. Their behavior was observed via two-way mirrors and their conversations monitored electronically. They were promised their freedom if they could go without sleep for 30 days.
  The first few days passed uneventfully. By the fifth day, however, the subjects began showing signs of stress and were overheard bemoaning their circumstances. They stopped conversing with their fellow inmates, choosing instead to whisper compromising information about one another into the microphones, apparently in an effort to win the favor of the researchers. Paranoia set in.
  On the ninth day the screaming began. First one subject, then another, was observed running around the chamber screaming for hours on end. Equally disconcerting was the behavior of the quieter subjects, who began ripping apart the books they'd been given to read, smearing the pages with feces and plastering them over the mirrored windows so their actions could no longer be observed.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  
  Then, just as suddenly, the screaming stopped. The subjects ceased communicating altogether. Three days passed without a sound from inside the chamber. Fearing the worst, the researchers addressed them via the intercom. “We are opening the chamber to test the microphones,' they said. 'Step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.'
  A voice from inside answered, “We no longer want to be freed.'
  Two more days passed without contact of any kind as the scientists debated what to do next. Finally, they decided to terminate the experiment. At midnight on the fifteenth day the stimulant gas was flushed from the chamber and replaced with fresh air in preparation for the subjects' release. Far from being pleased at the prospect of leaving, the subjects began screaming as if in fear for their lives. They begged to have the gas turned back on. Instead, the researchers unsealed the door to the chamber and sent armed soldiers inside to retrieve them. Nothing could have prepared them for the carnage they witnessed upon entering.
  One subject was found dead, lying face-down in six inches of bloody water. Chunks of his flesh had been torn off and stuffed into the floor drain. All of the subjects had been severely mutilated, in fact. Even worse, the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted. They had ripped open their own abdomens and disemboweled themselves with their bare hands. Some had even eaten their own flesh.
  The four who were still alive seemed terrified of falling asleep and refused to leave the chamber, again pleading with the researchers to turn the gas back on. When the soldiers attempted to remove the inmates by force, they fought back so ferociously they couldn't believe their eyes. One suffered a ruptured spleen and lost so much blood there was literally nothing left for his heart to pump, yet continued flailing for a full three minutes until his lifeless body collapsed.
  The remaining subjects were restrained and transported to a medical facility for treatment. The first to be operated on fought so furiously against being anesthetized that he tore muscles and broke bones during the struggle. As soon as the anesthetic took effect his heart stopped and he died. The rest underwent surgery without sedation. Far from feeling any pain, however, they laughed hysterically on the operating table — so hysterically that the doctors, perhaps fearing for their own sanity, administered a paralytic agent to immobilize them.
  After surgery the survivors were asked why they had mutilated themselves, and why they so desperately wanted to go back on the stimulant gas. Each, in turn, gave the same enigmatic answer: 'I must remain awake.'
  The researchers considered euthanizing them to obliterate every trace of the failed experiment, but were overruled by their commanding officer, who ordered that it be resumed immediately, with three of the researchers joining the inmates in the sealed chamber. Horrified, the chief researcher pulled out a pistol and shot the commanding officer point blank. He then turned and shot one of the two surviving subjects. Aiming his gun at the last one left alive, he asked, “What are you? I must know!'
  'Have you forgotten so easily?' the subject said, grinning. “We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.'
  The researcher fired a bullet into his heart. The EEG monitor flat-lined as the subject murmured these last words: 'So ... nearly ... free.'
  It's a given that human beings require a certain amount of sleep on a regular basis in order for our minds and bodies to function properly. Anyone who has experienced a night (or two, or three) of insomnia knows how critical even a few hours of refreshing sleep can be to one's health and well-being.
  What would happen if we went 15 or more days without the natural 'downtime' virtually every sentient creature requires? Would we fall apart mentally and physically? Would we go insane? Would we die? It's questions like these the Russian Sleep Experiment was supposedly designed to answer, with the horrifying, catastrophic results reported above.
  Now for a dose of reality gas.
  While the premise that keeping a group of people awake for 15 days straight would end in a cannibalistic bloodbath makes for a gripping fictional horror story , it's not borne out by scientific evidence. The so-called Russian Sleep Experiment never took place.
  In point of fact, no human experiments of the type and duration described above have ever been conducted (none that have been made public, at any rate), though we do have the results of a 1964 high school science fair project in which the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation were monitored by a bona fide sleep researcher from Stanford University and a professor of neuropsychiatric medicine. By default, it has come to be considered one of the seminal studies in the field.
  Randy Gardner , a student at Point Loma High School in San Diego, California, went without sleep for 11 days in a bid for the Guinness World Record for continuous wakefulness. He suffered bouts of dizziness, memory loss, slurred speech, hallucinations, and even paranoia over the course of the 264-hour experiment, but at no time did he exhibit anything resembling the extreme behaviors allegedly observed by the Russian researchers. Gardner reportedly slept for 14 hours straight when the project was over and awoke feeling rested and alert. He suffered no lasting ill effects.
  While Gardner did, in fact, beat the existing benchmark for days gone without sleep, his feat was never actually listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because he missed the submission deadline. The most recent title holder in that category (before Guinness retired it for fear of encouraging risky behavior, that is) was Maureen Weston of Cambridgeshire, England, who stayed awake for 18 days and 17 hours during a rocking chair marathon in 1977. She neither ripped open her own abdomen nor ate her own flesh. Ms. Weston holds the Guinness World Record for sleep deprivation to this day.
  ' The Russian Sleep Experiment ' is an example of creepypasta , an Internet nickname for frightening images and fictional horror stories that circulate virally online. The oldest version I've found was posted to the Creepypasta Wiki on August 10, 2010 by a user calling him- or herself 'Orange Soda.' The original author is listed as unknown.

"The Poison Dress","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/The-Poison-Dress.htm","2015-10-25 18:53:06","  By David Emery
  Also known as 'The Poisoned Dress,' 'Embalmed Alive,' and 'Dressed to Kill'
  Example: Submitted by a reader, March 1999...
  I remember what I consider to be an urban legend that circulated when I was younger, always around prom time. If I remember correctly, it was about a girl who wanted to go to the prom, but she was very poor. Well, she decided to save some money and go to the pawn shop and buy a secondhand dress. She bought a beautiful blue dress, went to the prom and had a wonderful time. The next day, her mom found her dead in her bed. When the doctors examined her, they found traces of embalming fluid in her body that had soaked through her pores when she danced. They went to the pawn shop and found that the dress had come from an undertaker's assistant who had stolen the dress of a corpse and hocked it for money.
  Example: From the Indiana State University Folklore Archives, 1970...
  This lady died, and she wasn't very old. A couple of her sisters went out to buy a dress to bury her in, and they couldn't decide between this yellow one or the purple one, so they took both of them with them to get approval from the rest of the family. They left both the dresses at the funeral home and later decided on the purple one, so they called the undertaker. I don't know if the undertaker didn't understand, but he had the yellow dress on her the next morning when the family came in. They told him about the mistake, and he exchanged the dresses, and they returned the yellow one to the store. A few days later a girl bought the yellow dress and wore it to a dance. During the dance she began sweating because the place was really full. After a few minutes she dropped dead. The stuff the undertaker had used had been so thick on the dress that it had killed her.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: Sometimes it's a blue dress, sometimes a yellow one, sometimes the crux of the narrative is a white wedding dress. The particulars vary but the denouement is always the same: a woman dies, poisoned by her own dress, a secondhand garment whose previous wearer had been a corpse.
  Folks have been telling the story since the 1930s, though the 'poisoned clothing' motif dates back much further -- to ancient Greece, in fact, and the myth of Medea . As it was told by the Greek playwright Euripides in the 5th century B.C., the 'witch goddess' Medea murdered Glauce, her rival for Jason's hand, by presenting her with a poisoned dress as a wedding gift. The dress burned Glauce alive (see also: Hercules and the robe of Nessus ).
  Inasmuch as the modern tale hinges on the supposed deadliness of physical contact with embalming fluid (or straight formaldehyde, in some variants), folklorists have long regarded it as apocryphal. 'As for the threat of real embalming fluid,' Jan Harold Brunvand wrote in a 1992 analysis of the legend, 'I once heard from a journalist who had asked a mortician about this point in the story. The mortician opened a bottle of the fluid and splashed some over his own face, saying, 'Does this answer your question?'' According to safety information provided by manufacturers, prolonged skin contact with embalming fluid may cause 'irritation in hypersensitive individuals,' but not death.
  Some commentators have pointed out that early variants of the story name specific department stores at which the tainted dress was supposedly purchased, concluding that its original purpose may have been to malign particular businesses. Not that I find this implausible, but I wonder if it doesn't miss the point.
  The place of purchase varies in the telling, as do the type and color of the dress, the nature of the occasion for which it's bought, and the specific chemical(s) it's allegedly contaminated with. What doesn't vary are the claims that 1) the dress had been previously worn by a corpse, and 2) the next person to wear it wound up equally dead.
  I believe this story expresses, above all, a fundamental horror of death itself, which is why we're still sharing it some eighty years after it was first told.

  Legend has it...
  A friend of a friend had a grandmother who was a little bit 'dotty,' as the family liked to say. One day after bathing her miniature poodle, Pierre, Grandma was preparing to towel-dry him when the phone rang. It was her daughter calling to remind her that they had arranged to meet for lunch a half hour earlier. Grandma apologized for being late and said she'd be there as quickly as she could.
  As she began drying Pierre's fur, it dawned on her that there was a quicker way to do it — the microwave. So she put her beloved pet inside the oven, set the dial to 'defrost' and switched it on.
  A half a minute later, as Grandma was donning her coat to leave, she heard a muffled explosion in the kitchen.
  Pierre the poodle was no more.
  Analysis: In classifying this story as an urban legend , I don't mean to suggest that nothing of the kind has ever happened — surely it has. I am suggesting that, generally speaking, when a tale such as this is told as 'true,' the teller has no direct knowledge nor any evidence whatsoever to back it up.

  Having heard the story secondhand, he or she simply assumes it is true (or might be true) and passes it on, with or without personal flourishes. This is a defining characteristic of urban legends .
  'The Poodle in the Microwave' (a.k.a. 'The Microwaved Pet') enjoyed its first wave of popularity in the mid-1970s. In part, it's a cautionary tale reflecting societal ambivalence toward technological change (a recurrent theme in contemporary folklore). Greater convenience entails greater risks, such stories seem to say, so we should approach new technologies with caution. Yet 'The Microwaved Pet' also hearkens back to warnings dating back to the 1940s, if not earlier, about dogs and cats suffering injury or death after crawling unnoticed into old-fashioned gas ovens. While one can always quibble over the 'function' or deeper meanings of urban legends, it's safe to say that they almost always serve as a barometer of our everyday fears.

  Sarah was so distraught after her boyfriend Jason broke up with her, we're told, that she killed herself. Not only did her vengeful ghost emerge from the shower drain and slash Jason's throat with a razor, but she'll do the same to you and me if we fail to share the story within 13 minutes of reading it!
  It doesn't make much sense, I'll grant you, but the ploy has been successful. 'A Scary Way to Break Up' has been copied and pasted thousands of times since it first appeared on the Internet five or so years ago. Needless to say, the story isn't true. Regardless of its content, the main purpose of a chain letter — any chain letter — is reproduction. The bogus claim that 24 people have died because they 'broke the chain' is a standard scare tactic.
  There's nothing supernatural at work in texts like this. No one has ever died because they didn't repost a chain letter. Anyone with first-person proof to the contrary is welcome to correct me from beyond the grave!

"Psychic Predicts Halloween Campus Massacre","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/campus_massacre.htm","2016-01-17 21:31:45","  On October 13, 2007 the Kent, Ohio Record-Courier reported that Kent State University was rife with rumors alleging that famous psychic Sylvia Browne had appeared on the Montel Williams Show and predicted a mass murder would take place on the campus Halloween night. University administrators investigated, the report continued, and concluded the story was an 'urban legend.'
  Rewind to October 28, 1998....
  
  THERE WAS no mistaking the urgency of the message that appeared in my inbox on the 21st of October. The subject header read: 'Mass Murder at MSU.' The message said:
  As a matter of fact I had heard the same rumor not a week before. Pat Grauer, an About.com colleague who also happened to be the public relations director for the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Michigan State, had written to apprise me of the urban-legendish rumor because her office was receiving quite a few inquiries about it — 'besieged' was actually the word she used — and could I shed any light on the situation?
  'It is reported,' she wrote, 'that last Monday or Tuesday on Oprah there was a guest who predicted (items in parentheses vary with teller):
  'I called university administration,' Pat went on to say. 'They've gotten a number of worried calls, from parents no less! I called Oprah's staff, and they said they've been 'swamped' with queries all week, and that NOTHING like that was said on the show.
  'The building in which I'm sitting at the moment fits the rumor to a 'T,'' she said.
  'People are scared.'
  'Wow, you've got a problem'
  Neither I nor Pat knew it at the time, but the same rumor was spreading simultaneously at the University of Dayton and would soon erupt at the University of Michigan and other campuses, as well.
  'Wow, you've got a problem,' I wrote back to Pat. 'I hadn't heard a word about this rumor until you contacted me. I've looked around to see if there's a buzz on the Internet and couldn't find anything there, either.'
  In my ignorance, I was treating the rumor as an isolated phenomenon. True, it had a familiar ring, but I failed to recognize it as a known urban legend — a gap in my education soon to be filled with Pat Grauer's help. She wrote the next day:
  'There was great reassurance at http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/campus.asp , which basically detailed the whole rumor as early as April 1997.'
  As early as 1997? So it was an urban legend! The URL pointed to the Urban Legends Reference Pages (Snopes.com), where every bogus story meets its match in David and Barbara Mikkelson, the Nick and Nora Charles of urban legendry. Unsurprisingly, they'd already sniffed out the goods on this one. From their article, 'Campus Halloween Murders':
  It was back to the library for me.
  Meanwhile, back at Michigan State
  'URBAN LEGEND STRIKES ‘U',' blared the front page of the State News of MSU on October 16. 'STUDENTS NEED NOT FEAR A HALLOWEEN MASSACRE THIS YEAR.' (Or any year, one would hope. )
  The article was full of reassuring words from University officials. A publicist for Oprah Winfrey stated that no such prediction had been made on her show. This was enough to soothe the frayed nerves of some students, but not all.
  'I'm scared,' freshman Adam Panter told the News . 'I’m going to the fraternity house for the weekend. I don’t care if it is true or not. I’m not waiting around to find out.'
  Panter resides in Holden Hall, an H-shaped building which also happens to be near some railroad tracks — a triple-whammy, if the rampant rumors are to be believed. State News staff writer Jennifer Meese summarized them thus:
  Little Bo Peep???
  Little Bo Peep, a knife-wielding maniac in pigtails
  In The Baby Train (W.W. Norton, 1993), folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand writes that among many other outbreaks over the past 20 years, four university campuses in the South and Midwest of the United States were hit by rumors very similar to the one that had cropped up at MSU. Certain details rung especially familiar:
  It was also rumored that the building would be U-shaped and located near a graveyard.
  At Ohio Northern University the Bo Peep motif was repeated, with the additional provisions that the ill-fated campus would have a name beginning with 'O' and be surrounded by 'very, very flat landscape.'
  The rumor at Purdue was that the killings would take place in an X-shaped building on either the highest or lowest spot on campus.
  And so on.
  'Nothing but a grisly rumor'
  The more I read, the clearer it became that outbreaks of the urban legend on U.S. college campuses around Halloween occur so regularly and in such similar detail that it has virtually become a tradition. The same whispered scenario circulates year after year after year... yet no one at any of these colleges has ever been slaughtered on Halloween night. The panic it causes is sometimes quite real, sad to say, but there's no adequate solution to the problem. I mean, banning Little Bo Peep costumes at Halloween parties — as was done on a couple of campuses in 1988 — may seem like a 'preventative measure' to some, but come on! This is just an urban legend — in Brunvand's words, 'nothing but a grisly rumor.'
  When I responded to the MSU student who contacted me, I said these things. I tried my best to reassure him that there's nothing to be afraid of. I wondered if more frightened students might contact me, but none did.
  Pat Grauer wrote again on the 26th to say that the rumor seemed to be 'diffusing' a bit on the MSU campus, but that local high school students were now picking it up and passing it around.
  Ah, well. At that point there were only five more days to go until Halloween, after which, thankfully, the crisis would be past for another year.
  Then, yesterday, a rather familiar-sounding message came in over the transom. It began:
  'I am doing a story on Urban Legends because the mass-murder-on-a-college-campus-type story is going around here at the University of Michigan...'
  It's going to be a looooong five days.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  There is this myth going around the internet for a couple of years now about a 'creature' called the Slender Man. The myth kind of goes that he's a creature without a face, wears a black suit, and has abnormally large and thin limbs. He's said to hide in forests and takes pleasure in feeding on children. When he grabs his victims, if they see his 'face,' they cannot look away and are unable to run away. One sign that this creature is beginning to hunt for victims is that children begin to have nightmares about him.
  I've heard that this is a made-up creature on a forum, but stories about him have been told in other countries. I don't know if this is real or fake, but ever since I heard of it I've been trying to find more information about it. Somehow, on the first day of learning about him, I fell ill and vomited that very day. I presume this might be just a coincidence, but lately I don't know. I would be very grateful if you research this story and see what your opinion might be. Thank you.

  Dear Reader:
  I've heard a lot of boogeyman tales in my time, but Slender Man (aka Slenderman, or 'Slendy' for short) is among the creepiest. To supplement your evocative description of him, here's a viral text that invariably comes up when you search for information about Slender Man on the Internet (please note, all misspellings and grammatical errors are in the original):
  The Slender Man is a supernatural creature that is described as appearing as a normal human being but he is described as being 8 feet tall and he has vectors or extra appendages that are described to be as sharp as swords. The creature is known to stalk humans and cause many disappearances. He is described as a shadow creature that has missing a face. The creature fits into many mythologies in legends from nations such as germany and celts which brings up the possibility that he could be real.
  If your question is whether such a nightmarish creature might actually exist, the answer, of course, is no. We're talking about a faceless supernatural monster eight to ten feet tall with tentacles for arms, who can make himself invisible and 'teleport' from place to place, and who stalks — some say eats — human victims, particularly children. No such entity exists in the real world. That's why people refer to it as a 'myth.'
  If you're asking whether it's true, as is claimed, that scholars have unearthed myths and legends referring to Slender Man sightings dating as far back as the Middle Ages, the answer to that, too, is no. Simply put, the so-called 'Slender Man mythos' one hears so much about on the Internet is a crowdsourced fiction , and quite a recent one at that. Though it shares many features in common with older, traditional boogeyman legends, it's set apart by the circumstances of its origin, which have been so well documented that we can pinpoint the exact date and place of Slender Man's creation.
  The Slender Man character was born in an online forum on the website SomethingAwful.com during an ongoing discussion entitled ' Create Paranormal Images .' The date was June 10, 2009. The thread began as a contest in which participants were invited to create 'strange photos' — specifically, 'images for bogus stories'  — with the potential to go viral. A pseudonymous forum member known as 'Victor Surge' (since revealed to be Eric Knudsen) entered the fray with a pair of Photoshopped images depicting a gaunt, faceless specter with half-a-dozen writhing tentacles in lieu of arms chasing a group of hapless children on a playground.
  This was the caption accompanying the first photo:
  'we didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time...'
  1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead. [ view photo ]
  This was the caption accompanying the second:
  One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as 'The Slender Man'. Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence.
  1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986. [ view photo ]
  These genuinely creepy images and bare bones of a backstory were an instant hit in the forum. More 'found photos' and 'documentation' of Slender Man's exploits would follow, but there was never any confusion as to the character's fictive status. Victor Surge took full credit for inventing him.
  'The Slender Man as an idea was made up off the top of my head,' Surge explained in a subsequent post. 'The name I thought up on the fly when I wrote that first bit. The asset I used for a couple of the pictures was the creepy tall guy from Phantasm , which sadly I have not seen, and the others various guys in suits.'
  The Internet took the idea and ran with it, and today, for good or ill, 'Slender Man' is a household name .

  I returned from a brief vacation to find a message in my inbox from Tor Strand, a reporter for the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang .
  'In our country,' he began, 'there is a story going wild among people these days...'
  Oh, boy, here it comes, I thought. He's going to tell me that Scandinavian gangbangers are firing on innocent drivers who flash their headlights at oncoming vehicles. It's happening everywhere else , you know.
  Instead, Mr. Strand surprised and delighted me by recounting the following tale, which he assumed to be an urban legend :
  continue reading below our video
  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  How romantic!
  Strand informed me that precisely the same thing is alleged to have happened in at least a half-dozen Norwegian towns — a strong indication that his assumption is correct: it's an urban legend.
  Diagnosis: myiasis of the vagina
  That said, it's worth noting that the phenomena described aren't completely beyond the bounds of medical possibility. Maggot infestations of living human tissues do occur. The scientific term for it is ' myiasis .' There have even been recorded cases of myiasis of the female sexual organs, though these are extremely rare.
  One case in particular caught my attention as I scanned the medical literature. In the abstract of a study entitled ' Vulvar Myiasis ,' published last year in Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology , researchers summarized 'the case of a 19-year-old pregnant girl diagnosed with vulvar myiasis and concomitant syphilis, vaginal trichomoniasis and genital candidiasis.' Oh, and she also tested positive for HIV.
  The diagnosis of a maggot infestation of the vulva combined with with four common venereal diseases suggests that the myiasis may have been sexually transmitted, too –- another nod toward the plausibility of Tor Strand's Norwegian horror story. One would think the odds against the survival of fly eggs on or in the gentleman's penis between the time of his necrophilic adventure and his encounter with the female protagonist of the story would be quite high, but apparently it's not out of the question.
  'The Bad Date'
  Still, when we find precisely the same story popping up in different places and marked by subtle differences in the telling, it's fair to conclude we're dealing with some type of folklore , even when it's conceivable there's a factual basis for it. Tor Strand made reference to six or seven variants. I can cite yet another: ' The Bad Date ,' shared by Øystein Skundberg in an online discussion in 1998:
  Boy breaks up with girl, who in her despair picks up a man at a bar, comes home with him, and has casual, unprotected sex. After some days, she experiences bad itch in her crotch. The girl goes to a medical doctor, which upon examining her looks very serious and concerned, says nothing, but gives her an appointment with a specialist. Girl off to specialist. He/she examines the girl, turns very grave, makes some notes, and tells her that she will have the results of the test in a week.
  The bewildered girl goes home. The next week, the police turns up on her doorstep to question her. When she ask why, they explain that the police is routinely contacted by doctors in every case of corpse-worm.
  The Skundberg variant employs a classic storytelling device: the three visits. In this example, proper diagnosis of the patient's condition is twice postponed, even though the condition should be perfectly obvious to the first doctor she sees. This is for dramatic effect. Doctor #1 examines her and appears 'concerned,' but refers her to a specialist. The specialist evinces a similar 'grave' reaction, but tells the patient she'll have to wait two weeks for test results. Our poor protagonist remains in the dark about her affliction until she's visited a week later by a policeman, who nonchalantly informs her that doctors routinely report all cases of 'corpse worm' to the authorities. Gasp!
  Maggots and metaphors
  Even if it stretches credulity, a well-honed horror story is bound to be a hit, and this one has clearly caught on in Norway. Its popularity may also stem from the fact that it can serve as a poignant and frightful metaphor for the dangers of indulging in unprotected sex in the age of HIV and AIDS. Maggots, which feed on carrion, have long been a literary symbol for death. In the present narrative, casual intercourse with a stranger leads to a carrion-like condition of the genitals — a symbolic brush with death through the act of sex. The imagery is powerful and disturbing, the moral perfectly suited to the times.
  I doubt we've heard the last of this one.

  A MAN and woman went to Las Vegas for their honeymoon, and checked into a suite at a hotel. When they got to their room they both detected a bad odor. The husband called down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the room smelled very bad and they would like another suite. The manager apologized and told the man that they were all booked because of a convention.
  He offered to send them to a restaurant of their choice for lunch compliments of the hotel, and said he was going to send a maid up to their room to clean and to try and get rid of the odor.
  After a nice lunch the couple went back to their room. When they walked in they could both still smell the horrible odor. Again the husband called the front desk and told the manager that the room still smelled really bad. The manager told the man that they would try and find a suite at another hotel. He called every hotel on the strip, but every hotel was sold out because of the convention. The manager told the couple that they couldn't find them a room anywhere, but they would try and clean the room again. The couple wanted to see the sights and do a little gambling anyway, so they said they would give them two hours to clean and then they would be back.
  When the couple had left, the manager and all of the housekeeping staff went to the room to try and find what was making it smell so bad. They searched the entire suite and found nothing, so the maids changed the sheets, changed the towels, took down the curtains and put new ones up, cleaned the carpet, and cleaned the suite again using the strongest cleaning products they had.
  The couple came back two hours later to find the room still had a bad odor. The husband was so angry at this point he decided to find whatever this smell was himself. So he started tearing the entire suite apart.
  As he pulled the top mattress off the box spring of the bed he found the dead body of a woman. God only knows how long it had been there.

  A WOMAN decides to take a trip to a tropical location (I think it was Costa Rica). Her plan is to relax and get a suntan during the week that she's there.
  She spends the week lazing on numerous beaches, but on the last day decides to take a tour through a forested area. While in the area, she happens upon a secluded waterfall and a quiet resting place, where she decides to take a swim and then dry off in the sun.
  The woman falls asleep while lying in the sun. When she wakes up, she's horribly frightened by a spider crawling on her cheek. She hurriedly brushes the spider away and carries on her way. A few weeks after returning home, the woman develops a cyst of sorts on her cheek. She goes to the emergency room, where the doctor tells her they will need to pop the cyst to let the fluid escape. The woman agrees to this simple and painless procedure. The doctor proceeds. As it's a painless procedure, the woman is not anesthetized. Soon after the doctor makes the first attempt to pop the cyst, the woman hears a gasp and then feels something trickling down her cheek. She assumes it's the fluid. The doctor tells her not to panic. Instinctively, she brings her hand to her cheek to wipe off the fluid. At that point she realizes that it's not fluid, but rather something crawling on her cheek. Spiders.... hundreds of tiny spiders are crawling all over her face and on her hand!
  She lets out a blood-curdling scream and totally loses it.
  She is so distraught and out of control that she needs to be restrained by several staff. To this date, she remains in the psychiatric ward of the same hospital where the procedure took place. Fair warning.

  Subject: Travelers BEWARE!!!!!!
  Dear Friends,
  I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that is targeting business travelers. This ring is well organized, well funded, has very skilled personnel, and is currently in most major cities and recently very active in New Orleans.
  The crime begins when a business traveler goes to a lounge for a drink at the end of the work day.
  A person in the bar walks up as they sit alone and offers to buy them a drink. The last thing the traveler remembers until they wake up in a hotel room bath tub, their body submerged to their neck in ice, is sipping that drink. There is a note taped to the wall instructing them not to move and to call 911. A phone is on a small table next to the bathtub for them to call.
  The business traveler calls 911 who have become quite familiar with this crime.
  The business traveler is instructed by the 911 operator to very slowly and carefully reach behind them and feel if there is a tube protruding from their lower back. The business traveler finds the tube and answers, 'Yes.' The 911 operator tells them to remain still, having already sent paramedics to help. The operator knows that both of the business traveler's kidneys have been harvested.
  This is not a scam or out of a science fiction novel, it is real.

  A FRIEND of a friend knows a family who were on vacation, driving through some remote part of the country in their station wagon. They had brought Grandma along even though she was quite elderly and not feeling well, because her heart was set on going on this one last trip with her grandchildren, and they didn't want to disappoint her.
  Unfortunately, at some point during the long drive Grandma passed away in the back seat of the car.
  Her grandchildren, sitting on either side of her, became hysterical.
  Since they were several hours away from the nearest sizable city, the father did the only thing he could think of to remedy the situation. He wrapped Grandma's corpse in a thick blanket, secured it to the luggage rack on top of the station wagon, and drove on.
  When they finally reached the outskirts of civilization the father stopped at a service station and everyone clambered out of the car while he used a payphone to call authorities and report the death. Understandably nervous and upset, he didn't realize he had left the keys in the ignition.
  When the family went back to the car they found it had been stolen, along with all their possessions... and Grandma!

  As told by Felicia McEntire...
  This story has been told over and over in my town (Harrison, Arkansas). Here goes...
  There were two college roommates, Sarah and Megan. Sarah was the theatrical type and loved acting. She was in all the town's plays. Megan was more of a book person, she loved to read and her studies were her first priority.
  Anyway, there was a huge play called 'Oh, Susannah' that Sarah was in, and it was coming up on Saturday ... so every chance that Sarah got, she would practice in the park (that's where she got her inspiration) for hours. Every time, she would beg Megan to go with her, but Megan would stay in the dorm and read.
  Well, on Saturday Sarah was a hit. Being the star, she was detained after the play, and got home really late. As she entered, she heard her roommate's rocking chair squeaking in the corner, but couldn't see it, not all the lights were on. Must be waiting for me, Sarah thought. Putting her stuff away, she went back into the main room.

  'Stop it Megan! Don't give me that crap, okay?' said Sarah.
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop it! I mean it, Meg!'
  'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me...'
  'Stop!!!!! That's it!!!!' Sarah screamed as she flicked on the room's lights.
  Sarah gawked in horror at the sight. Her roommate's body was in the rocking chair , but her head wasn't, her head was on the wall, kept there by a butcher knife. From behind the rocking chair she could hear laughter – maniacal laughter.
  'Who's there? Who are you?'
  From behind the rocking chair jumped a man, later found out to be the butcher that escaped from the sanitarium in the next town. All the time he was cutting Sarah, he was singing, over and over, 'Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me... I come from Alabama with a banjo on my knee.'
  Pinning Sarah to the wall next to her roommate's head, he screamed, 'Now, Susannah, don't you cry for me!!!!'
  Analysis: Before the term ' urban legend ' became popular, folklorists referred to tales of this kind as 'migratory legends' because they pop up from place to place over time, studded with localized details to enhance their credibility and emotional impact. The legend retold above is a hometown variant of 'The Roommate's Death,' which dates back to the 1960s and shares motifs with ' Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Light? ' and ' Humans Can Lick, Too .'
  One thing that distinguishes this version of the story from others is 'Oh, Susannah,' the killer's chant. The repetition of this line from the chorus of the old folk song not only ratchets up the horror of the moment when the murderer's presence is revealed, but suggests — because he is clearly aware that she has been rehearsing a play called 'Oh, Susannah' — that he has been stalking and observing her for quite some time.
  Another way this version differs from other retellings is how it ends: Instead of escaping with her life (traditionally, the story is given a 'close call' ending), the protagonist is left helpless in the clutches of the crazed killer who murdered her roommate.

"Skinned Tom","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/ghoststories/a/skinned_tom.htm","2015-10-08 17:45:36","  By David Emery
  As told by B. Bailey, 07/29/00...
  Where I live (semi-rural east Tennessee) we have our very own version of Freddy Krueger. He's known as 'Skinned Tom.'
  In life, Tom was a good-looking guy who liked the ladies. Once he'd dated all the available girls in the area, he started seeing a girl in the next town -- not knowing she was married. Eventually her husband got wind of what was going on and vowed revenge on the two of them. He told his wife he was going out of town for the weekend, then hid in the woods behind their house. As he'd guessed, that evening Tom showed up to take the lady out. The husband followed them to the nearby Lovers' Lane.
  Things were getting pretty hot and heavy (if you know what I mean) when all of a sudden the car door was jerked open and Tom came face-to-face with one very huge, very angry-looking dude wielding a hunting knife.
  'Oh no!' screamed the girl who had started all the trouble in the first place. 'It's my husband!'

  'That's right, you cheating @#%&*!' yelled her husband. 'And I'm about to teach you a lesson you'll never forget!' He pulled her off Tom, rammed the knife into her stomach once, and tossed her aside. Then he turned back to Tom, grinning maniacally.
  'Don't hurt me!' Tom begged. 'I swear to God I didn't know she was married!' But the wronged husband didn't listen. He dragged Tom out of the car and skinned him alive with the hunting knife. Then he went to town and turned himself in to the police.
  When the police arrived at the crime scene , they found the woman, who was miraculously still alive. But Tom was nowhere to be found.
  They say he's still hanging around Lovers' Lane, waiting to catch a couple and 'teach' them the same lesson his girlfriend's husband taught him. He's described as a bloody skeleton in '20s clothes, carrying the knife he himself was skinned with. All the teenagers around here grow up hearing 'Don't go to Lovers' Lane if you don't want to be Skinned Tom's next victim!'
  To me, it sounds like a crock, like something parents and cops made up to keep their kids from going parking. But still, you won't catch me around there.
  Analysis: This is not a ghost story I was familiar with until I was sent this version, nor have I seen it in other collections. Unlike most lovers' lane urban legends , which typically revolve around a pair of necking teens who experience a close call with a random murderer but live to tell the tale (or at least one of them does), 'Skinned Tom' is a tale of betrayal revenge, pure and simple. Here, the killer is a scorned husband; the victims are his cheating wife and her lover, who pays the most horrific price imaginable for sleeping with another man's wife. She, of course, survives to rue her infidelity and the carnage that ensued. The moral of the story is impossible to miss.

"Snake Eats Man","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/snakes/ss/Snake-Eats-Man.htm","2015-12-13 20:49:21","  Description: Viral images & text Circulating since: 2000 Status: Dubious
  Example #1: Forwarded email contributed by a reader in June 2001:
  Snake... THIS IS FOR REAL!!
  A CREW MEMBER ON A LAND OIL RIG IN AMAZONAS WENT OUT AND TOOK A NAP. YES, A NAP. HE WAS MISSING AND THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND.
  ANYONE WANT TO GO TO THE AMAZON????
  Example #2: Forwarded email contributed by a reader in January 2001:
  Subject: : Read this before Camping...... in Singapore
  This is scary.
  Ok, this is unbelievable. The story goes that 3 military guys in Singapore were spending the night in the jungle. When they bedded down at night there were 3 of them, when they awoke in the morning there were only 2. The 2 remaining men did not hear or see what happened to their partner during the night. The following photos show a python. They found it nearby. It was having trouble moving...
  Before jumping to the conclusion that whoever captioned the preceding images knew what they were talking about, consider that what you have just read is only one of many variants of the tale in circulation. Each gives a slightly different rundown of events.
  There's another version, otherwise identical to the first, which claims that the incident happened in Venezuela, not Brazil. Still another says it occurred in Nouakchott, Mauritania.
  And another specifies the locale as the Philippines.
  The victim's identity is as variable as the setting. Sometimes the person allegedly swallowed by the snake is described as an oil worker, sometimes as a hunter, sometimes a camper and, in at least one case, a child:
  Apparently, three boys were sleeping in the jungle in South America when the other two woke up, one was missing and a huge snake was laying next to them. You'll see the snake in the first two photo's with the boy inside and the third one is when they cut the snake open to reveal the boy.
  The variant below, contributed by a reader in March 2001, claims it 'really happened' to a hunter camped out in the Brazilian rain forest:
  Unbelievable but true
  Just remember .... things could always be worse.
  Be careful when you go camping.
  This really happened In Brazil...Three Locals went hunting in the forest and did the usual during the day, they went to sleep. When they woke up the next morning, one of the guys was missing...
  The other two searched for their missing friend and when they ran across this anaconda with a huge lump..... well they caught the anaconda and took it to town since they feared that their friend was the victim. Surprise: it was!
  He was swallowed in one piece by a 17 FT anaconda. That's not a way anyone wants to go.
  Or it could have really happened to this camper in Palo Duro Canyon, Texas -- a part of the world where, as we all know, everything is larger than life...
  THE STORY IS THESE TWO GUYS WERE CAMPING IN PALO DURO CANYON OR SOUTH AMERICA, MAYBE. ONE OF THE GUYS WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HIS BUDDY WAS GONE. HE SENT FOR HELP TO FIND HIM, THEY FOUND THIS SNAKE INSTEAD. PICTURES 1&2 ARE OF THE SNAKE WHEN THEY CAUGHT IT. AND 3 IS WHAT THEY FOUND WHEN THEY CUT THE SNAKE OPEN, THE MISSING BUDDY!!
  A more detailed account of what's supposedly happening in these photographs comes to us via the Weekly World News , a now-defunct U.S. tabloid newspaper renowned for such earth-shattering scoops as ' Ape Gives Birth to Human Baby ' and 'JFK Was Shot to Prevent Him From Revealing Truth About UFOs.'
  According to an article in the July 25, 2000 issue of WWN , the victim was actually Pakistani tourist Amjar Bukhari, who was swallowed by a boa constrictor and spent '12 to 15 horrifying minutes trapped in the serpent's belly before workers at Nairobi National Park [Kenya] sliced open the enormous snake and rescued him.' 'We sliced open the snake's belly and a pair of human legs tumbled out,' one of the rescuers is quoted as saying. 'At first we thought the man was dead — then I saw his foot twitch and we quickly hauled him out.' The story says Bukhari survived, believe it or not, with a couple of fractured ribs and 'minor burns from the snake's stomach acid.' Truth be told, the Weekly World News version of events is no more credible than the narratives circulating online. Historically, the paper's editors exhibited a great fondness for snake-eats-human stories with no evident interest in their veracity. WWN published two such items during the early 1990s, each illustrated with an identical World War II-vintage photograph of a python bulging with freshly consumed prey — and each telling a completely different story. One claimed the victim was a Japanese scientist; the other stated that the snake had swallowed six human babies. What had really happened, as another, unpublished photograph from the same shoot revealed, was that the snake had recently fed upon a small deer.
  Totting up the claims of all these different sources, we have so far been told that the reptile in question is a python, a boa constrictor and an anaconda . Obviously, it can't be all three. My best guess after comparing the viral image with what I could find in reference books is that the snake is a python — not that that lends credibility to any particular version of events. All of these stories were plainly made up after the fact.
  No one seems to know where or when the photos were really taken, let alone who snapped the shutter. We don't even know if all of the snapshots came from the same camera. The first two match up with one another quite well, but the third and fourth are strikingly different in coloration and quality. It's hard to tell for sure if we're even looking at the same snake.
  Photos #3 and #4 could have easily been staged — i.e., snake is cut open, half-digested prey is discarded, man (or boy) crawls into the carcass, picture is taken. The poor quality of the images doesn't help.
  Do snakes ever swallow people whole? Maybe, maybe not. Pythons, boas and anacondas have been known on rare occasions to attack people — even to suffocate and kill them — but there's a dearth of documented cases wherein big snakes consumed human prey.
  Snake attacks, especially when the perpetrator is one of the larger specimens, almost always make headlines. Why have we seen nothing in the papers (apart from the Weekly World News , I mean) about the horrendous event supposedly depicted in these photos?
  I won't attempt to argue that no snake has ever swallowed a person, but it is surely a rare phenomenon. As to whether this well-traveled set of images constitutes proof, I can only venture an opinion: probably not.

  Also known as 'The Ghost Hitchhiker,' 'The Phantom Hitchhiker' and 'The Lady in White'
  A newlywed couple, Nathan and Heather, were driving up the northern California coast to spend their dream honeymoon in a quaint bed-and-breakfast with a seaside view. They had hoped to arrive before dark, but a heavy fog had descended on Highway 1 and their progress was slow. They were at least an hour-an-a-half from their destination as night fell.
  If you've ever driven that stretch of highway you know how tortuous it can be, with its narrow lanes and switchback curves. It was just as they were rounding one of those curves that they passed a solitary hitchhiker, a young woman in a wispy white dress standing on the shoulder with thumb outstretched.
  'Good luck getting a ride on a night like this,' muttered Nathan under his breath.
  'Stop the car and turn around,' said Heather. 'Please, she's all alone. We have to give her a ride.'
  'We're two hours late.'
  'Please.'
  continue reading below our video
  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  Nathan pulled off the road and turned around. As they approached the girl from the opposite direction they could see her dress was in tatters. Her face was pale and gaunt.
  'Can we give you a ride?' Heather asked as they pulled up beside her.
  'Oh, thank you,' said the young woman, who appeared to be in her late teens or early twenties. 'I have to get home. My parents will be worried sick.'
  'Where do you live?' asked Nathan.
  'Just down the road, about 10 miles,' she said, climbing into the back seat. 'There's an intersection with an abandoned gas station. Across from there. It's a white house with a rose garden. They're waiting for me.'
  As they made their way north again Heather attempted to make conversation, but the girl fell silent and slumped in the back seat, apparently asleep.
  After about 15 minutes Nathan spotted a dilapidated service station.
  'Is this it?' he asked. 'Hey, is this the intersection?'
  Heather turned to wake the young woman and caught her breath. 'Nathan, she's gone.'
  ''What do you mean, 'she's gone'?' Nathan said, pulling into the driveway of the white house. 'How can she be gone?'
  She was right. The hitchhiker had vanished.
  A light came on and two people, an elderly couple, stepped out onto the porch.
  'Can we help you?' the man asked. He looked as though he dreaded hearing the answer.
  'I don't know,' Nathan began. 'We were driving, and we picked up this hitchhiker, a girl.'
  'And she gave you this address,' said the man, 'and asked you to bring her home.'
  'Yes,' said Heather.
  'And then she was gone?' Heather nodded. 'You aren't crazy,' the man said. 'And you're not the first. She was our daughter. Her name was Diane. She passed away seven years ago, killed by a hit-and-run driver on the highway. They never caught whoever did it. I guess her spirit won't rest until they do.'
  Nathan and Heather were speechless.
  'Won't you come inside for coffee or tea?' said the woman. 'You've had a shock. Some in and sit down.'
  'No. Thank you, but no. We're late,' said Heather. 'We have to get going.'
  After exchanging uncomfortable goodbyes, the newlyweds departed, as they had arrived, in stunned silence.
  
  Analysis: Thanks to the excesses of Hollywood, our expectations of ghost stories have come to include unrelenting violence and gore, but these were never integral to the genre. Ghost stories of old traded in the mysterious and the uncanny . They were about fleeting encounters between the living and the dead, the latter being portrayed as desperate souls stuck between life and the afterlife, unable to rest in peace. There's a fundamental melancholy to these stories, which are more apt to raise goosebumps than shrieks of terror.
  'The Vanishing Hitchhiker' is a ghost story in the traditional mold. Jan Harold Brunvand , who literally wrote the book on this somber tale ( The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings , 1981), described it as 'the most often collected and the most discussed contemporary legend of all.' It was given a unique entry in Baughman's Type and Motif-Index of the Folktales of England and North America (1966 edition):
  Ghost of young woman asks for ride in automobile, disappears from closed car without the driver's knowledge, after giving him address to which she wishes to be taken. The driver asks person at the address about the rider, finds she has been dead for some time. (Often the driver finds that the ghost has made similar attempts to return, usually on anniversary of death in automobile accident. Often, too, the ghost leave some item such as a scarf or a traveling bag in the car.)
  Variants of 'The Vanishing Hitchhiker' are told all over the world, each imbued with its own local color and details. In Chicago the homesick ghost is known as Resurrection Mary and is said to haunt Resurrection Cemetery in nearby Justice, Illinois. In northern California she's known as the Niles Canyon Ghost (or White Witch of Niles Canyon); in Dallas, the Lady of White Rock Lake ; in Spanish-speaking countries she's often referred to as La Chica de la Curva .
  I'm fascinated by the undercurrent of grief that runs through this legend. The ghost grieves for the loss of her home and her parents; her parents grieve for her. Grief is a natural emotion, but here it's protracted because the lost loved one continually reappears. Is it a subtextual argument for the necessity of letting go? One could make such a case if this were a literary work, but it's not. It's folklore . In the absence of a sole authorial voice, the most we can say is that the story gives visceral expression to our feelings about that most vexing of human predicaments, mortality.

  Also known as 'The Stuffed Baby'
  As told by a reader:
  A woman and her 4 year old son are visiting a border town on the Mexican side of the Texas/Mexico border. As they are walking towards the border crossing to return to the U.S., a man runs up to her and takes her child. She immediately runs to the authorities and a search ensues.
  The lady and the authorities begin walking among the cars looking for her son. The woman spots her child in a truck a couple of rows over. Her son is laying his head on the shoulders of man and appears to be sleeping.
  As the authorities close in on the vehicle, the driver jumps out of line and makes a run for it. As they are driving off, the passenger opens his door and dumps the child out into the street. As the woman and the authorities reach the child they find, to their horror, that the child has not only been murdered but has been cut open and illegal drugs have been put inside his body.
  It appears that the persons in the vehicle were drug smugglers and had decided to kidnap a child, kill them and place the drugs in the body. They would then hold the child as they approached the border and the border agents would think that the child was quietly sleeping on the shoulder of the passenger.

  Text of a forwarded email received in 1998:
  My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas, who with her husband was planning a weekend trip across the Mexican border for a shopping spree.
  At the last minute their baby sitter canceled, so they had to bring along their two year old son with them. They had been across the border for about an hour when the baby got free and ran around the corner. The mother went chasing, but the boy had disappeared. The mother found a police officer who told her to go to the gate and wait.
  Not really understanding the instructions, she did as she was instructed. About 45 minutes later, a man approached the border carrying the boy. The mother ran to him, grateful that he had been found. When the man realized it was the boy's mother, he dropped the boy and ran himself. The police were waiting for him and got him.
  The boy, dead, in the 45 minutes he was missing, was cut open, ALL of his insides removed and his body cavity stuffed with COCAINE.
  The man was going to carry him across the border as if he were asleep.
  A two year old boy, dead, discarded as if he were a piece of trash for somebody's cocaine.

  God Bless you in this united effort to spread the word. You just might save a life!
  Analysis: It's always a treat to see a well-worn urban legend retooled for circulation on the Internet. Such is the case with a familiar horror story dating from the early 1970s claiming that drug smugglers have been known to use the corpses of abducted, murdered children to transport their illegal goods across national borders. We first encountered the version immediately above 1998. It continues to circulate to this day.
  Customs and law enforcement officials tell us the story isn't true. In all the decades this grisly legend has been in circulation, no real instances matching the descriptions above have been confirmed or documented.
  The legend, or the bare bones of it, anyway, got its first mainstream media airing in 1985 when the Washington Post recounted it as factual in the interests of livening up a feature about crime problems in Miami. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand noted in his mid-'80s collection of urban legends, The Mexican Pet (W.W. Norton, 1986), the Post quickly found out that the story was untrue and retracted it a week later.
  The published correction read, in part:
  In the opening paragraph of an article last Monday on crime in Miami, the Washington Post recounted a story that cannot be substantiated. The story, told to a Post reporter several years ago by a Miami undercover agent, involves the smuggling of cocaine into the United States in the body of a dead baby.
  Clifton Stallings, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, said 'the story has been in circulation for some time. No one at Customs in Miami can verify it.' - Washington Post , March 30, 1985
  One customs official told the Post he had heard the story as long ago as 1973. As it was told in those days, he said, a suspiciously immobile child was spotted by an attendant on a flight from Colombia to Miami. Customs agents investigated and found that the baby, apparently deceased for some time, had been 'cut open, stuffed with cocaine and sewn shut.' It was considered a prime example of just how ruthless of international drug traffickers can be.
  As told on the Internet, it has became a much more compelling story. Set just across the U.S.-Mexico border and recounted in true 'friend of a friend' fashion ('My sister's co-worker has a sister in Texas,' a frequently shared variant begins), the cautionary tale now carries a dual moral message: Drugs are evil, and never let your children out of your sight. Represented as a parent's 'true' nightmare, the online version concluded with a prayer that the story would convince people to stop using drugs. The more likely result is that has reinforced many people's already well-entrenched fears.

"What's the Charlie Charlie Challenge, and Why Is It Freaking People Out?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/fl/Charlie-Charlie-Challenge.htm","2015-06-01 02:55:27","  You never know when you might need to contact a demon , right? But what's the best way to do that? Don't worry, Twitter will show you how. Just search for tweets using the hashtag '#CharlieCharlieChallenge' and gain access to literally thousands of Vines and YouTube videos demonstrating a simple procedure for interacting with an alleged 'Mexican demon' by the name of Charlie.
  Here's the Charlie Charlie Challenge in a nutshell:
  1. Take a sheet of paper and draw two lines, one horizontal and the vertical, to form a simple cross.
  2. Write the word 'YES' in two of the diagonally opposing quadrants thus formed, and the word 'NO' in the remaining two.
  3. Place one ordinary pencil over the horizontal line, and balance another vertically on top of it, again forming a simple cross.
  4. Ask a yes-or-no question. 'Charlie, Charlie, are you there?' for example. Or, 'Charlie, Charlie, can you come out to play?'
  5. Wait for it. If Charlie is present, the top pencil will rotate to reveal his answer.
  Make sure you say goodbye
  The reactions of those videoed performing the challenge range from nervous giggles to outbursts of profanity to uncontrollable shrieks before dashing out of the room. They've clearly bought into the demonic scenario described in this viral Tumblr post:
  That's all rather scary if taken at face value, but is any of it true? Take the claim that the 'Charlie Charlie' game is Mexican in origin. According to BBC Mundo correspondent Maria Elena Navez, it is not. 'Mexican legends often come from ancient Aztec and Maya history, or from the many beliefs that began circulating during the Spanish conquest,' Navez is quoted as saying on BBC.com .
  'In Mexican mythology you can find gods with names like 'Tlaltecuhtli' or 'Tezcatlipoca' in the Nahuatl language. But if this legend began after the Spanish conquest, I'm sure it would've been called 'Carlitos' (Charlie in Spanish).'
  She's right. I've not found any references in texts on Mexican folklore to a demon named Charlie (or Carlitos), or traditional games or rituals involving the summoning of said demon. Some of the online videos feature people speaking in Spanish, and in a few of those the name 'La Llorona' (from the famed Mexican ghost story) is invoked instead of 'Charlie,' but that doesn't make the pencil ritual a 'Mexican tradition.'
  An 'old' tradition by Internet standards only
  The oldest mention I've found of anything resembling the Charlie Charlie Challenge was a question posted on Yahoo! Answers in 2008:
  Note that in the above variant six pencils (or pens, or markers) are called for, and the players hold them in their hands instead of laying them crosswise on a sheet of paper ( a 2014 video shows two kids playing that version of the game).
  The oldest video I've found is dated September 26, 2008 and features the more familiar version of the game, though the name 'Charlie' is never uttered in it.
  Demons or physics?
  So, why does the pencil move? Is it a demon or someone else trying to make contact from 'the spirit world,' or can the phenomenon be explained in more ordinary terms? It's easily the latter. For one thing, the pencil doesn't always move. When it does move, it could be caused by a slight breeze, someone breathing or blowing on it, or the mere fact that one pencil is balanced so precariously on top of the other in the first place.
  As in any case where science can sufficiently explain why a phenomenon occurs, there's no reason to assume supernatural forces are at work.
