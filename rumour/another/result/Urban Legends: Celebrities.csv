"Richard Gere and the Gerbil: A Moral Tale","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/richard_gere.htm","About That Thing with Richard Gere and the Gerbil ...","2005-07-19 19:08:55","  I don't mean to sound cranky, but it's more than a bit wearisome that the first thing that pops out of some people's mouths when they learn I write about urban legends is, 'What about that thing with Richard Gere and the gerbil ? Is that true?'
  You learn a lot about human nature in this racket. Or should I say, a lot of your worst suspicions about human nature are confirmed, time and time again.
  Like, people everywhere are suckers for gossip about sex.
  Weird sex. The-weirder-the-better sex. We're obsessed with it, in fact, and that seems to short-circuit our capacity for rational thought.
  How many here already know what ' gerbilling ' is? Raise your hands.
  Now, how many of you actually believe that anyone really does this sort of thing on a regular basis?
  Raise your hands.
  I see. Shame on you.
  For those of you still sitting in the dark, here's a definition: gerbilling (sometimes referred to as gerbil stuffing ) is the practice, most often attributed to gay men, of inserting a live rodent into one's rectum (or that of a partner) for erotic pleasure.
  And what are the known facts about gerbilling? In reality, it's not a 'practice' of any group of people, gay or otherwise. And while the activity, dangerous as it may be (gerbils have claws!), has surely been tried by someone, somewhere, sometime — maybe even more than once — it is not, if I may repeat myself, a common erotic pastime in any known culture or subculture, gay, straight, or otherwise.
  The burden of proof is on those who claim otherwise .
  The specific rumor we're here to address goes something like this:
  Several years ago, 'they' say, Richard Gere was admitted into the emergency room of a Los Angeles hospital with a foreign object lodged in his rectum. Some say Gere was alone when he arrived, others say he was accompanied by a friend (former love interest Cindy Crawford tops the list).
  In any case, an x-ray was taken and it was determined that the foreign object was a gerbil (either alive or dead at that point, depending on who tells the story). Mr. Gere was rushed to surgery, where it literally took a team of doctors to extract the unfortunate animal. Some say the gerbil was found to have been shaven and declawed; others claim it had been encased in a special plastic pouch. I've even heard it said that the gerbil was Gere's own beloved pet (appropriately named 'Tibet' in this variant). In any event, when the gerbilectomy was done the medical team was sworn to secrecy (unsuccessfully, we must conclude), and Gere went on his merry way, suffering no permanent harm other than to his reputation.
  'Is it true?' you ask.
  There isn't a shred of evidence that it ever happened. And while Gere himself has neither confirmed nor denied it — indeed, he has rarely spoken of it at all — neither have credible witnesses come forward in the twenty-some-odd years this story has been circulating to offer firsthand testimony to back it up.
  'I've never worked harder on a story in my life,' National Inquirer reporter Mike Walker told the Palm Beach Post after spending months trying to verify the rumor in 1995.
  He came away convinced he'd been chasing an urban legend.
  Richard Gere wasn't the only, nor even the first, American celebrity to be defamed with such allegations. Identical rumors circulated during the 1980s about a Philadelphia TV news anchorman , and later about a certain linebacker for the Cleveland Browns.
  How, why, and where did the story come to be attached to Richard Gere? No one knows, exactly. Some commentators point out that shortly after Gere achieved national attention for his appearance in the film Pretty Woman , an anonymous hoaxer forged a fax alert purporting to originate from the ASPCA deriding the actor for what it labeled 'gerbil abuse.' The accusation bounced from one end of Hollywood to the other, and beyond. But whether this was the legend's actual point of origin remains uncertain.
  Why would someone invent such a story? For the same reasons any vicious rumor about a celebrity gets started. Movie stars are wealthy, powerful people, always in the public eye and always, therefore, the subject of envy.
  They're walking targets for defamation. There exist in this world people who seek to bolster their own self esteem by sullying other people's reputations — by trying, in essence, to steal a bit of that celebrity's fame and glory for themselves. So it has been since time immemorial.
  The story bears every hallmark of an urban legend .
  While the basic narrative has remained consistent through the years, smaller details have varied and mutated, exactly as one would expect in a story told and retold tens of thousands times over.
  Like every classic urban legend, the tale of Richard Gere and the gerbil conveys a moral message, perhaps best articulated, if half-facetiously, by Cecil 'The Straight Dope' Adams: 'Stick to mammals your own size.'
  Lastly and most poignantly, the presumption that the story is valid always rests on the alleged personal experience of witnesses other than the storyteller, someone who was 'there when it happened' but who is always at least two or three acquaintances removed from the person speaking or writing.
  Here's a verbatim example from (where else?) the Internet:
  And another:
  Everyone I've questioned who reported having heard the story offers some variation of the the above: 'I know someone who knows someone who was working in that hospital when it happened.'
  Based on how frequently that claim has been made, I calculate there must have been no fewer than a hundred thousand people on staff at 'that hospital' ( Cedars Sinai ) that night. Surely you know one of them, too.
  Update: In 2006, actor Sylvester Stallone publicly stated that he believes Richard Gere blames him personally for starting the rumor. Or was Stallone slyly trying to take credit for it? You be the judge.

"Don't Believe the One About Ann Coulter and a Black Pilot","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/ss/Ann-Coulter-Refuses-To-Board-Plane.htm","Ann Coulter Refuses to Board Plane with Black Pilot?","2013-02-01 18:42:30","  Description: Viral story / Satire Circulating since: Jan. 2013 Status: False (see details below)
  Excerpt: As posted on Facebook, Jan. 31, 2013:
  According to witness reports Coulter was concerned the experienced, decorated pilot in question may have gained her position as a result of affirmative action and wasn't fully qualified to fly.
  Analysis: No such incident occurred. The text and photo above originated in a satirical (i.e., fictitious) article published on the humor website The Daily Currant on Jan. 29, 2013.
  Allow me to direct your attention to the disclaimer prominently displayed on the ' About ' page of The Daily Currant :
  Q. Are your newstories [sic] real?
  A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world
  Allow me to also direct your attention to the name of the alleged TSA spokesperson quoted in the article: ' Dirk Diggler .' (Did anyone here see Boogie Nights ?)
  It's true that Ann Coulter is famously outspoken and that as a conservative she holds the view that affirmative action programs are unjust and unnecessary, but so far as I'm aware those views have never caused her to erupt in a screaming fit on a crowded airliner.

"Amazing True Stories of Angelic Intervention","http://paranormal.about.com/od/angels/a/aa121905.htm","Encounters with Angels","2005-12-18 19:56:39","  DO ANGELS EXIST? Are there supernatural spirit beings that watch over us? Many believe that angels are not only around us at all times, but that in certain instances they can even intervene in our lives. Sometimes they offer comforting feelings or words, or messages of encouragement. In the most astonishing cases, they are even credited with changing the courses of lives  even saving people from certain injury or death.
  Here are some amazing stories from readers  ordinary people like you.
  Kissed by an Angel
  When she lost custody of her only child, Helen fell into a dark depression from which she saw no remedy. I came to a breaking point where I did not want to live with the circumstances as they were... my pain was too great, Helen says.
  I cried my heart out to God so strongly, then collapsed on my bedroom floor with a completely broken heart.
  I just kept asking God, Why me? Why did this turn out this way? Suddenly, I heard a man's voice very clearly and calmly say, Get up. It's not over. It's not over.
  At first I was afraid, but then an extreme peace came over me. I stopped crying and stood up. Those words gave me hope. I went to bed and began to pray again to God, when suddenly I felt a kiss on my cheek! It was clear as day, but there was nobody with me. Once again, I was overcome with the greatest sense of peace, love and tranquility that I know only comes from God.
  I fell into an immediate sleep and dreamt of the Archangel Michael standing beside my bed staring down at me with an incredible look of concern and compassion.
  His eyes were a spectacular blue, and he had a strong nose and beautifully chiseled face with long hair. He was wearing white and his wings wrapped around my entire bedroom as if enclosing me in a cocoon. I knew it was Michael, because he had a large sword in his hand as if to protect me. And I knew in my heart that this was who kissed me and that he was sent by God to minister to me.
  The next morning, I awoke for the first time in months feeling as if my burdens were all lifted. It was the first time I asked God to help me forgive the judge, my husband and all the people who hurt me. From that day on, my depression lifted, and I began to rebuild my life as a weekend mom. Today, I have an excellent relationship with my now almost 15-year-old son, and we treasure our time together.
  My Son's Protector
  One theory says that angels are spiritual beings who never lived as mortals. Others, however, believe that loved ones who have passed on can become our guardian angels. Anne is one of those people. She believes her mother may be watching over her son from another plane of existence.
  When he was seven, he came running in the house on a usual day with an unusual tale, Anne recalls. He said he was out riding bikes and running around like all the kids did. He was running really fast and tripped on something he didn't see. As he looked at the ground he was about to hit, there was a 2x4 with a big nail sticking out pretty far  and it was headed right for the middle of his forehead. There was no stopping his momentum. Suddenly, two adult-size hands grabbed him around the torso and set him upon his feet, just like that  and there was no one near him at the time.
  Why does Anne think it was her mother? She remembers a powerful experience when her son was just four months old.
  One night I was home alone with my son, Josh. I was at the end of the hallway sitting on the edge of the tub running a bath. Where I was, I could see the living room. Josh was in a room right off the living room in his crib asleep. Suddenly, I knew someone was sitting in the chair in line of my sight, but there was no one physically there. I turned off the water. Seeing as my son was in the room next to this thing, I had no choice but to confront.
  I was not afraid. Suddenly, I felt a difference in a part of the room. It was as if a door to another place altogether had opened up in front of me. The entity came to me and put its arms around me. The closer it got, the more love I felt so intensely. I came to know who it was. It was my mom.
  By the time she actually embraced me, I was in joyful tears. She moved over to the room my son was in. She was next to his crib now, admiring him and telling me without words how beautiful he was and how loved he was. I saw her smile at me. Maybe she's been with us all along.
  Next page > Blessed pregnancies
  Are pregnant women afforded special attention from the angelic realm? Consider Alicias experience who, in the summer of 1980, was seven months pregnant when she was driving back home from a visit with her obstetrician. The weather was hot and sweltery, Alicia says, and having no air conditioning in my car, I was riding along with the window rolled down.
  As I approached a curve in the road, I heard a voice say Roll up the window!
  You're about to be hit by a rock! There was no one in the car with me, I didn't have the radio on, and there was not a car in sight in front of me or behind. Yet the voice prompted a feeling in me that was so urgent, it filled me with such conviction that I immediately rolled the window up.
  Not 60 seconds later, a large gravel truck came around the curve from the opposite direction.
  As our vehicles passed one another, a large stone fell from the truck, bounced, and whacked my window right beside my head. Had I not listened to what I thought of as some strange inner voice, I don't know that I  nor my unborn son  would be here today.
  Angelic Touch
  Leah believes her mother had an angelic intercession before she was pregnant. She and my dad wanted a baby more than anything in the world, Leah says, and they had been trying for months and nothing was happening. My mom found out from the doctor that she had a small uterus, like the size that a child would have, and that chances of her ever getting pregnant were slim to none.
  My parents both strongly believe that you should put every problem you have in God's hands and believe that he will bless you and provide you with what you need.
  So every night they would continue to pray before they would go to sleep.
  My mother is a very deep sleeper, but one night something woke her up. She looked next to her and standing there was a bright white figure. She saw an arm extend in front of it coming toward my mom. She closed her eyes and felt the hand touch her belly.
  When she opened her eyes, it was gone.
  About two weeks later, she found out she was pregnant, and on August 21, 1977 she gave birth to my sister Lydia. To this day my mother will tell you that God had answered hers and my father's prayers by sending them an angel.
  Guardian Angel Took the Wheel
  Most astonishing and mind-boggling are the cases in which lives are literally saved by these unseen forces. It was November, 2004 when Henry was driving home from a dinner party. It was about 11:30 p.m.
  I had a little to drink that night, Henry admits, but I stopped drinking about 9:30 p.m. I was driving north on the Antelope Valley freeway to my home in Lancaster, California. I dozed off while driving close to the Escondido Canyon road area. I actually fell asleep driving 85 mph!
  Suddenly, my head was raised from the lowered position it was in and my eyes were forced open. I saw a metal guard rail coming right at me at 85 mph. This I know because I glanced at my speedometer. Something grabbed my wrist tightly and smoothly steered my car away from the guard rail. I could hear the squeals of my tires and I felt the car was going to tip over. It didn't. I have no doubt whatsoever that my guardian angel saved my life that night.
  Next page > Angels in human form
  Tammy was also driving when she received a forceful message that probably saved her life and the lives of her daughters. My girls and I had just been visiting my parents, Tammy recalls. Before we knew it, it was midnight. My parents asked me to stay the night since it was so late and very foggy, but I just wanted to get home. My two girls, ages one and four, were soon sound asleep in their car seats behind me.
  I had my music turned on pretty loud.
  The four-lane road that I had to take had a very steep hill in the middle of it. When I first turned onto the road, I stayed in the fast lane. Later, I started thinking about the hill that was coming up, and about which lane would be the safest to drive in. I could only see one car length ahead of my car.
  I decided that a car going down the hill might drift into my lane (because of the thick fog) and I didn't want to get hit head-on.
  I decided to switch into the slow lane. Still nearing the hill, I heard a voice (not out-loud, but in my mind) say, Get back in the fast lane. I then saw a movie (in my mind) of me driving in the slow lane and suddenly about to crash into the back of a big truck that had stalled halfway up the hill. I couldnt see it until the last minute because of the fog.
  Then I heard it again. Get in the fast lane! I moved into the fast lane just before I started up the hill. When I was just about to reach the top, there, in just an instant, I saw the outlines of three people trying to push a stalled car to the side of the road.
  They all ran from the car to the side of the road as I approached. The back bumper of the car was still two feet into my lane. I had to swerve to miss it. The car was sideways, blocking all of the slow lane and partly into my lane.
  I barely missed that bumper. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would pop right out of my chest.
  I thought about what could have happened if I had not listened to the voice. I dont know if it was a guardian angel, but Im thankful to have gotten the warning.
  Pinball Angels
  Rarest of all angelic encounters are those in which the beings materialize in physical form  usually appearing as regular people. But their actions suggest they are something much more. Josh may have been lucky enough to meet these beings in a desperate situation.
  My van broke down in Tennessee as I drove to Virginia, Josh says. I hitchhiked to a truck stop after having the van towed to a local mechanic. I spent my last two dollars on chips and a drink. I started to ask people if anyone was headed north to Virginia. Nobody would help me. Hours went by as I looked at magazines.
  All of a sudden there was a man and woman with blonde hair wearing all white. They were playing pinball. I walked over and asked if they may be going to Virginia. The woman said sorry and smiled at me.
  I walked back to the magazines. After their game, the couple walked over to me and asked if I was hungry. I explained how I was now broke. They treated me to dinner. It was getting late and they said they lived in the motel next to the truck stop. I was hesitant, but they seemed very kind. I also needed a shower. I noticed in their hotel room that they had no other belongings or clothes. I asked about this and the woman said, Don't you know what we are? Then the word angels came to my mind and the room seemed to get brighter and more comfortable.
  After I showered and came to my bed (it was a room with two beds), I was worried again about their intentions. The guy said, We install aluminum siding on houses around here, and help out folks who travel. We watched some TV and I fell asleep. I'm a light sleeper and whenever I woke up, the other two were just smiling peacefully, as if they didn't really need sleep.
  The next day, they bought me a bus ticket. Before I got on the bus, we prayed together. They reminded me to be blessed and be a blessing. Halfway to my bus I turned around... and they had vanished.

"11 'Rules of Life' Bill Gates Didn't Really Share","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/fl/Bill-Gates-11-Rules-of-Life.htm","Bill Gates' 11 Rules of Life","2016-06-26 18:34:41","  By David Emery
  Circulating via email and social media, the text of a speech allegedly given to high school graduates by Bill Gates in which he sets out his '11 rules for life' to help them succeed in the real world.
  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: Feb. 2000 Status: Falsely attributed to Bill Gates (details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by Roman S., Feb. 8, 2000:
  Bill Gates' Message on Life
  For recent high school and college graduates, here is a list of 11 things they did not learn in school.
  In his book, Bill Gates talks about how feel-good, politically-correct teachings created a full generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.
  RULE 1 ... Life is not fair; get used to it.
  RULE 2 ... The world won't care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.
  RULE 3 ... You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone, until you earn both.
  RULE 4 ... If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure.
  RULE 5 .. .Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity.
  RULE 6 ... If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.
  RULE 7 ... Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try 'delousing' the closet in your own room.
  RULE 8 ... Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades; they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.
  RULE 9 ... Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summer off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.
  RULE 10 ... Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.
  RULE 11 ... Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one.

  Analysis: Whether you regard the above as a much-needed dose of realism or an unnecessarily vituperative browbeating, the main thing you need to know is that former Microsoft chairman Bill Gates neither wrote these words nor delivered them in a speech to high school students, or anyone else, ever.
  I repeat: Bill Gates did not write these words or deliver them in a speech. On occasions when he has spoken to graduates , his message has been altruistic and positive, and his tone inspirational, not scolding. Mr. Gates may or may not agree with all or some of these 'rules of life,' we don't know; but we do know he didn't come up with them.
  As frequently happens when texts are copied and shared over time, something written by one person has come to be attributed to another — someone more famous, as is often the case. In this instance the displaced text is a pared-down version of an op-ed piece written by education reformer Charles J. Sykes , best known as the author of Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why American Children Feel Good about Themselves, but Can't Read, Write, or Add . The op-ed was originally published in the San Diego Union-Tribune in September 1996. It began making the email rounds under Bill Gates' name in February 2000, and has continued to do so ever since.

"Brad Pitt's Love Letter to His Wife","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/ss/Brad-Pitt-About-His-Wife.htm","Brad Pitt About His Wife: 'A Secret of Love'","2013-09-26 18:47:05","  Description: Viral message / Forwarded email Circulating since: 2012 Status: Incorrectly attributed to Brad Pitt (details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Belinda M., July 11, 2013:
  Brad Pitt about his wife:
  My wife got sick. She was constantly nervous because of problems at work, personal life, her failures and children. She lost 30 pounds and weighted about 90 pounds. She got very skinny and was constantly crying. She was not a happy woman. She had suffered from continuing headaches, heart pain and jammed nerves in her back and ribs. She did not sleep well, falling asleep only in the mornings and got tired very quickly during the day. Our relationship was on the verge of a break up. Her beauty was leaving her somewhere, she had bags under her eyes, she was poking her head, and stopped taking care of herself. She refused to shoot the films and rejected any role. I lost hope and thought that we’ll get divorced soon… But then I decided to act. After all I’ve got the most beautiful woman on earth. She is the idol of more than half of men and women on earth, and I was the one allowed to fall asleep next to her and to hug her. I began to shower her with flowers, kisses and compliments. I surprised and pleased her every minute. I gave her a lot of gifts and lived just for her. I spoke in public only about her. I incorporated all themes in her direction. I praised her in front of her own and our mutual friends. You won’t believe it, but she blossomed. She became better. She gained weight, was no longer nervous and loved me even more than ever. I had no clue that she CAN love that much.
  And then I realized one thing: the woman is the reflection of her man.
  If you love her to the point of madness, she will become it.
  Brad Pitt
  Analysis: 'My wife got sick,' Brad Pitt supposedly says in the opening of this essay he supposedly wrote, but here's the thing: when the text first appeared, Brad Pitt didn't have a wife. He divorced Jennifer Aniston in 2005 and started a family with Angelina Jolie the following year, but they had not, as of 2012 when 'A Secret of Love' went viral on the Internet, gotten married. When the couple announced their engagement in April of that year, this paean to Pitt's 'wife' had already been circulating for at least a month.
  Who did write it remains a mystery. The earliest posting of it I've found is dated March 21, 2012 and already credits the text to Pitt.
  Lest there be any doubt as to his alleged authorship, according to Snopes.com a representative for Brad Pitt confirmed he had nothing to do with writing or disseminating the piece.
  Update: Brad Pitt and Angelie Jolie wed on August 23, 2014.
  Things they never said: • Robin Williams' Plan for World Peace • Bill Cosby: 'I'm 83 and I'm Tired' • Don Rickles Roasts Democrats • George Carlin: 'I Am a Bad American' • Neil Armstrong: 'Good Luck, Mr. Gorsky'

  After an international search, Spanish actress Paz Vega was chosen to play the role of 'Flor', a single mom struggling to give her young daughter the best life possible in writer/director James Brooks' relationship drama, 'Spanglish.' Spending one day in the company of Brooks, Vega so captured the spirit of the part that Brooks knew he'd found the perfect actress to play off of Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni.
  INTERVIEW WITH PAZ VEGA ('Flor'):
  Was your audition different than from how you played the character? That audition I did in the house, my husband taping me. I didnt speak English. I learned, I memorized my lines like a parrot. I don't know how [director James Brooks] called after that. I hope that you can see its very different.
  How did you develop a relationship with the actress who plays your daughter? She has a natural way. Shes a kid and shes great, shes a fantastic little woman and actress. It was very interesting to work with kids.

  5 Classic Novels Everyone Should Read
  I never worked with kids before and it was very interesting. Sometimes, you know, kids get tired and blah, blah, blah and I would say, Shh, shut up! Like a mother. Show some respect!
  How do you work so well with children? Its interesting [and] at the same time, its difficult. Somebody in Spain, I don't know who or where, said to me, Never work with kids or with animals because it is very, very hard. And this movie, kids and animal, and it was great. No problem. I loved working with kids because the energy is great.
  Do you have kids of your own? No, no, not yet.
  What were the differences of doing a movie here and doing one in Spain? The biggest difference is living in another city and not knowing anybody. Sometimes I feel alone and its difficult. But in the crew, on set, its the same work. I just have to learn some lines, perfectly in English. Thats it.
  How did you learn English? When I was shooting I just talked with people, because I didnt have time to have classes after the shoot. It was impossible. Now Im taking a class here in LA with a teacher. And talking, like seven hours, its the best way. Also watching TV. Now I understand many, many things. In the beginning, I watched TV and I couldnt understand anything.
  Do you still live in Spain? Yes.
  So youre just here for this? Do you come to LA often? Oh, yes, yes. Now for the press junket. Im learning Englishbefore the movie Id never been here, just 10 days for a vacation with my husband. But Id never been here. But now, in the last year, I spent more time here than in Spain. I was here for one year.
  Was it difficult for you to play a different kind of Latina, somebody from Mexico, not Spain? Did you have to study Mexican culture? No, because the Spanish and Mexican cultures are very similar. All the Latin cultures, Spanish and other countries, are the same. What I had to learn was the accent because its very different.
  Do you speak Castillian? Yeah, Castillian, with the zzzs
  What was it like working with Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni? With Adam the work was funny, really, really funny. The mood and the crew on set was always great, because this movie is a comedy and all the cast, they are very funny. Adam, you know, is funny, all the time joking and making us laugh. Tea, shes fantastic, she, in the movie, all the time is crying, upsetbut not [of the screen]. Shes amazing, very funny, makes jokes. Cloris [Leachman] is the best. She has a lot of energy. To me, its ironic. It was great.
  Do you understand Flors insistence on preserving her culture even though she was in another country? Yes, of course. I think it is important to maintain your personality, your roots, very important. In my case its very important. And I have a Latin or European lifestyle, whatever you want to call it. The interesting thing is to mix this culture with another culture and not cut things out.
  Your character was resistant to change. For the first six years, she stayed with all Latins. I had the opportunity to meet many women from Mexico, living here for 13 years, she doesnt speak English. This is the extreme. But I think here, for example in LA, the minority is very big. Its not a minority. Its normal that people everyday talk to Spanish speakers because there is a lot.
  What do you like best about America and what do you like the least? America, I like the spirit. Because American people here believe in something. I like that spirit.
  And not like? I dont know, I dont know. Well, for example, the fast food, its terrible. Its not the food because here the food can be great, but the normal, fries, when you are here you have to think, No, I dont want to eat that.
  Penelope Cruz came here from Spain not too many years ago and became very much an American actress. Are you looking to do that or are you going to make this movie and go back to Spain? I dont know. This is my first Hollywood movie. And Im reading very good scripts. I have to decide. Its very difficult to decide. And Im very open to proposals.

  In a story supposedly told by actor Lee Marvin on The Tonight Show, he served in the military with fellow U.S. Marine Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan, whom he described as 'the bravest man I ever knew.'
  Description: Urban legend Circulating since: 2002 Status: Mostly false
  Example: Email contributed by F. Abbott, March 20, 2002:
  Subject: FW: Bravery
  'Never judge a book by its cover.'
  Dialog From a Johnny Carson 'Tonight' Show. His guest was Lee Marvin. Johnny said, 'Lee, I'll bet a lot of people are unaware that you were a Marine in the initial landing at Iwo Jima and that during the course of that action, you earned the Navy Cross and were severely wounded.'
  Lee Marvin's response was: 'Yeah, yeah ... I got shot square in the ass and they gave me the Cross for securing a hot spot about halfway up Mount Suribachi. The bad thing about getting shot up on a mountain is guys getting shot hauling you down. But Johnny, at Iwo, I served under the bravest man I ever knew. We both got the Cross the same day, but what he did for his Cross made mine look cheap in comparison. The dumb bastard actually stood up on Red Beach and directed his troops to move forward and get the hell off the beach. That Sergeant and I have been life long friends.'
  'When they brought me off Suribachi we passed him and he lit a smoke and passed it to me lying on my belly on the litter. 'Where'd they get you Lee?' he asked. 'Well Bob, they shot me in the ass and if you make it home before me, tell Mom to sell the outhouse.'
  'Johnny, I'm not lying, Sergeant Keeshan was the bravest man I ever knew!' You now know him as Bob Keeshan. You and the world know him as 'Captain Kangaroo'.

  Analysis: Despite sundry grains of truth scattered throughout — including the fact that both Lee Marvin and Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan served in the military as Marines during World War II (Keeshan a reservist), and that Marvin really was wounded in the buttocks while storming a beachhead (though it happened in Saipan, not Iwo Jima) — the story above is mostly false as told.
  According to their respective biographies, Marvin had already been injured and shipped back to the United States with a Purple Heart by the time Keeshan entered basic training. They could not have encountered one another in combat. Neither was awarded the Navy Cross.
  At the age of 20, Lee Marvin was a private in the U.S. Marines 4th Division, part of the Allied landing force that invaded the Japanese-held Pacific island of Saipan on July 15, 1944. He was wounded three days later on July 18, spent the next 13 months in Navy hospitals recovering from a severed sciatic nerve, and was discharged in 1945.
  Bob Keeshan signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve shortly before his 18th birthday in 1945. Since the war was all but over by the time he finished basic training, it's unlikely Keeshan ever saw combat before completing his service a year later, let alone attained the rank of sergeant.
  Those old enough to remember Lee Marvin's occasional appearances on TV talk shows up until his death in 1987 will find the manner and spirit of the storytelling reminiscent of the man himself, but it seems unlikely he would have trumpeted such blatant lies about another man's service record over national television, nor have I been able to find any evidence in the form of tapes or transcripts that prove he did so.
  Update: A version of this message circulating since March 2003 includes an addendum claiming that Fred Rogers , host of public television's 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,' was a former Marine sniper (or, in another version, Navy SEAL) with dozens of wartime kills to his credit. This, too, is false.
  Update: Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan died on Friday, January 23, 2004.

"Rod Stewart Had WHAT Pumped Out of His Stomach?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/celebrities/a/stomach_pump.htm","Celebrity Stomach Pump","2003-05-29 23:14:03","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  Have you ever heard the legend about Rod Stewart passing out on stage?  He was subsequently taken to the hospital and had his stomach pumped.  From within his stomach, they allegedly siphoned many ounces of fresh semen, enough to fill a pint glass.  A mug of cum!
  Dear Reader:
  And so discreetly phrased! Thank you!
  You may be interested to know that precisely the same story, give or take a pint or two, has been told of Elton John, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Jon Bon Jovi, Alanis Morissette , Britney Spears and Lil' Kim, to name but a few. Rod Stewart just happened to be the main target of the rumor when it was going around in the 1980s. Apparently it was assumed by many people that he's gay, which is contrary such evidence as we have regarding the matter.
  The origin of the story dates back to the early '70s, when seemingly every high school and college campus across the United States could claim a ' Promiscuous Cheerleader ' who, rumor had it, was rushed to the the emergency room to have her stomach pumped after servicing the entire football team (or basketball team, etc.) at a party.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Clearly the moral focus of this cautionary tale has changed over time, with female rock stars replacing gay-seeming male rock stars as the 'slutty cheerleaders' of the moment.
  As to the fundamental credibility of the story, well — never mind the practicalities of how a person might manage to ingest so much semen in one sitting when the average volume of male ejaculate, according to experts, is one-half to one teaspoon and there are 96 teaspoons in a pint (do the math) — what I'd like to know is, can semen really be so toxic that emergency stomach pumping is required?
  Given that it consists only of water, sugar, proteins, and some harmless trace ingredients, I suspect not.
  2012 Update Kudos to Rod Stewart, who took it upon himself to address the stomach pump allegations in his book, Rod: The Autobiography , published Oct. 23, 2012:
  Interestingly, Stewart describes the rumor as an act of revenge by an employee he had fired, his personal assistant Tony Toon.
  'Toon's revenge was absolutely inspired,' Stewart wrote. 'He fed the press a story in which, as a consequence of an evening spent orally servicing a gang of sailors in a gay bar in San Diego, I had been required to check into a hospital emergency room to have my stomach pumped.'
  Though he acknowledges that the rumor has dogged him ever after, Stewart reflects upon the experience with surprising grace and forgiveness. 'Say what you like about Tony Toon — and God rest his soul,' he wrote, 'but he was good at his job.'
  It's a cautionary tale after all.

"'The Cat's Meow' and the Legend of Thomas Ince's Death","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/celebrities/a/the_cats_meow.htm","'The Cat's Meow'","2003-10-23 20:04:16","  By David Emery
  Long ago and far away when I was a TV writer in Los Angeles, I went to work every day at the historic Culver Studios (formerly the Desilu, Selznick, RKO, Cecil B. Demille and Thomas H. Ince Studios), where I overheard rumors to the effect that the lot's 1918-vintage administration building — known to all who work there as 'the Mansion' — was 'haunted.' Co-workers spoke of hearing strange noises and encountering spooky apparitions in stairwells. Some were sincerely reluctant to enter the building after dark.
  The Mansion's spectral resident, I soon learned, was believed to be the ghost of the studio's founder, pioneer filmmaker Thomas H. Ince , who died in 1924 under what some called 'suspicious circumstances' during a birthday party in his honor aboard newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's yacht, the Oneida. The guest list included Charlie Chaplin , wannabe film actress (and Hearst mistress) Marion Davies , and wannabe gossip columnist Louella Parsons .
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  By all accounts there was a good deal more going on that weekend than the celebration of Ince's 43rd birthday. Ince and Hearst were said to be in the middle of tense business negotiations. Chaplin was said to be romantically interested in Davies (a rumor of which Hearst was painfully aware). The ambitious Parsons lusted after fame and fortune. In the aftermath of a boisterous first evening of bootleg-fueled dickering, bickering and revelry, the putative guest of honor took suddenly and mysteriously ill, as a result of which Hearst precipitously docked the yacht in San Diego and sent the party goers home.
  Ince died a few days later. Published reports cited 'acute indigestion' as the cause of death, but rumors began circulating immediately to the effect that Ince had been the victim of foul play. The fact that the body was cremated without an autopsy and no inquest was ever held only fueled speculation about what 'really' happened aboard the Oneida on November 15, 1924, speculation which continues to this day.
  Peter Bogdanovich's 2002 film The Cat's Meow enacts one version of events — a version inspired by three-quarters of a century of scurrilous hearsay, granted, but that needn't obstruct your enjoyment of this wonderfully evocative re-creation of Roaring Twenties Hollywood. Nor should you be deterred by critics' complaints that the script is too soap opera-ish or the acting too broad. To my mind these stylistic choices are wholly appropriate to what is, after all, a tabloid tale with all the classic trimmings: lust, envy, jealousy, greed, and a handgun.
  How true to life it is we shall probably never know, fresh murmurs from the haunted stairwells of Ince's Mansion notwithstanding.

"The Dangers of Illegal Immigration: One Week of Headlines","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/illegal-immigration/fl/The-Dark-Side-of-Open-Borders-and-Illegal-Immigration.htm","The Dark Side of Open Borders and Illegal Immigration","2014-07-17 11:57:19","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Establishment Republicans have become so worried about losing Hispanic votes that they are afraid to confront the illegal immigration epidemic head-on. Yes, the media and the left will drop the 'racist' charge on anyone who favors enforcing the US-Mexican border to prevent thousands upon thousands of people from crossing the border illegally. We get inundated with tear-jerker exposes on the so-called 'dreamers.' These are the illegal immigrants who are portrayed as having been brought across the border at a young age and grew up as Americans and want nothing more than to be good Americans.
  The way the debate has been framed by the leftist media for years has made the GOP afraid to tackle the subject. The line between illegal and legal immigration has been blurred, if not completely eliminated. Tired lines about how 'the nation was built on immigration' are deployed time and again. This understandably left the fully non-persuasive and inept Republicans to jump on the pander-mobile as their desire to hold onto power meant left them abandoning doing what is right.
  The country is now paying the price.
  And while those tug-at-your-heart stories are beloved media features that have undoubtedly shifted the polls towards legalization over the years, the reality of the problems illegal immigration causes can no longer be ignored. Shouldn't we know who is and who is not in the country legally? Here is just one week of illegal immigration stories:
  La Grulla, Texas - A member of the 'hyper-violent gang' MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and several other illegal immigrants, possibly recruits, were found during a traffic stop. Apparently this was the third time the gang-member had been caught illegally on US soil and deported. MS-13 is considered one of the most violent gangs and has been recruiting teenagers, in competition with the drug cartels, who are crossing the border.
  Mesa, Arizona - After a police officer was killed in a head-on collision with an illegal immigrant with a .24% blood alcohol content - he was driving the wrong way on the freeway - the officer's mother penned a letter to President Obama. She noted that the man who killed her son 'was in this country illegally, convicted of previous crimes, no Social Security number, no valid driver's license BUT he had purchased a vehicle and registered it to drive in Maricopa County Arizona.'
  Parker County, Texas - A four-time deportee was arrested for allegedly breaking into a neighbors home and molesting a young girl. After being caught and deported in 2003, 2004, 2009, and 2010, his family members say that he re-entered the country roughly 30 days before the incident for a 5th time, riding in on the wave of 'undocumented children.'
  Washington, D.C. - As the crisis continued to unfold, Congressional Democrats went further and announced that we cannot build a wall and that America's 'doors are open,' that taxpayers were on the hook for the 'health, safety, and educational needs' of these illegal immigrants and that they were entitled to taxpayer-funded legal representation.
  Lubbock, Texas - An illegal alien who was set free just last month as part of the Obama administration's catch-and-release policies was arrested for allegedly bludgeoning his girlfriend to death.
  Mission, Texas - Another tragic side effect of elements within the US encouraging illegal alien crossings is the number of casualties. A report noted that many attempts to cross the Rio Grande have failed as illegal immigrants 'don’t make it across the river; multiple sources became emotional when recounting their discoveries of small, lifeless bodies washed up along the riverbank.' A Guatemalan teenager recently died in the Texas desert.
  El Paso, Texas - The pro-illegal crowd has tried to argue that those crossing the border are doing so to escape violence in Central America and should be considered refugees. But a government report , with DEA and Homeland Security input, found that over 95% of those illegals surveyed on why they crossed revealed that it was believed that unaccompanied minors and non-Mexican women would be given passes, not because they were escaping violence.
  According to Gallup, illegal immigration is now the 'most important problem' facing the United States today. The problem barely registered in a tie for 10th place at the beginning of 2014. The problems with illegal immigration go beyond just those listed here. This is but a snapshot of a week of stories. The short and long-term costs associated with illegal immigration are worrisome. Obama sought nearly $4 billion dollars to 'handle' the crisis that his administration effectively created by contracting out escort services for those crossing the border. The high costs for housing and educating, as well as taking care of the health needs is also a major problem, especially for a government that is still running yearly deficits in excess of $550 billion.

"The Bush Doctrine","http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/defense/a/The-Bush-Doctrine.htm","The Bush Doctrine","2011-07-13 17:54:51","  By Steve Jones
  The term 'Bush Doctrine' applies to the foreign policy approach that George W. Bush practiced during this two terms as president, 2001-2009. It was the basis for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.
  The Bush Doctrine grew from neoconservative dissatisfaction with President Bill Clinton's handling of the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein in the 1990s. The U.S. had beaten Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. That war's goals, however, were limited to forcing Iraq to abandon its occupation of Kuwait and did not include toppling Hussein.
  Many neocnservatives, and indeed many Americans in general, were unhappy that the U.S. did not depose Hussein. Post-war peace terms also dictated that Hussein allow United Nations inspectors to periodically search Iraq for evidence of programs to build weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which could include chemical or nuclear weapons. Hussein repeatedly angered neo-cons as he stalled or prohibited U.N.
  continue reading below our video
  Overview of the Iraq War
  inspections.
  In January 1998, a group of neoconservative 'hawks' (who advocated warfare, if necessary, to achieve their goals) sent a letter to President Clinton calling for the removal of Hussein. They explained that Hussein's interference with U.N. weapons inspectors made it impossible to gain any concrete intelligence about Iraqi weapons. For the neo-cons, Hussein's firing of SCUD missiles at Israel during the Gulf War and his use of chemical weapons against Iran in the 1980s erased any doubt that he would use any WMD he obtained.
  The group stressed that 'containment' of Hussein's Iraq had failed. In the main point of their letter they said, 'Given the magnitude of the threat, the current policy, which depends for its success upon the steadfastness of our coalition partners and upon the cooperation of Saddam Hussein, is dangerously inadequate. The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. In the near term, this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.'
  Signers of the letter included Donald Rumsfeld , who would become George W. Bush's first secretary of defense, and Paul Wolfowitz, who would become undersecretary of defense.
  The Bush Doctrine has an element of 'America first' unilateralism that revealed itself well before the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the War on Terror, or the Iraqi War.
  That revelation came in March 2001, just two months into Bush's presidency, when he withdrew the United States from the U.N.'s 'Kyoto Protocol' to reduce worldwide greenhouse gasses. Bush reasoned that transitioning American industry from coal to cleaner electricity or natural gas would drive up energy costs and force a rebuilding of manufacturing infrastructures.
  The decision made the United States one of two developed nations not subscribing to the Kyoto Protocol. The other was Australia, which has since made plans join protocol nations.
  After Al Qaeda terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the Bush Doctrine took on a new dimension. That night, Bush told Americans that, in fighting terrorism, the U.S. would not distinguish between terrorists and nations that harbor terrorists.
  Bush expanded on that when he addressed a joint session of Congress on September 20. He said, 'We will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.'
  In October 2001, U.S. and allied troops invaded Afghanistan , where intelligence indicated the Taliban government was harboring Al Qaeda.
  In January 2002 Bush's foreign policy headed toward one of preventive war. Bush described Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as an 'axis of evil' that supported terror and sought WMD. He said, 'We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.'
  As Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin commented, Bush was putting a new spin on a traditional war policy. 'Preemption has in fact been a staple of our foreign policy for ages -- and other countries' as well,' he said. 'The twist Bush put on it was embracing 'preventive' war: Taking action well before an attack was imminent -- invading a country that was simply perceived as threatening.'
  By the end of 2002, the Bush administration was talking openly about the possibility of Iraq possessing WMD and reiterating that it harbored and supported terrorists. That rhetoric indicated that the 'hawks' who had written Clinton in 1998 now held sway in the Bush cabinet. A U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003, quickly toppling Hussein's regime.
  A bloody insurgency against American occupation of Iraq and U.S. inability to quickly prop up a working democratic government hurt the Bush Doctrine. Most damaging was the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Any 'preventive war' doctrine relies on good intelligence, but the absence of WMD highlighted a problem of faulty intelligence.
  The Bush Doctrine essentially died in 2006. By then the army in Iraq was focusing on damage repair and pacification, and the military preoccupation with Iraq had enabled the Taliban in Afghanistan to reverse American successes. In November, public dissatisfaction with the wars enabled Democrats to reclaim control of Congress. It also forced Bush to usher the 'hawks' -- most notably Rumsfeld -- out of his cabinet.

"How We Know the Story of Ciara's Secret Sex Change is a Hoax","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/ciara.htm","Ciara's Secret Sex-Change Operation","2005-09-13 17:24:10","  By David Emery
  A forwarded email circulating since early 2005 claims hip-hop/R&B star Ciara was born male and is either a closeted transvestite or underwent a sex-change operation to become a transsexual. Neither, of course, is true; but try telling that to the internet.
  Description: Internet rumor / Hoax / Spoof Circulating since: 2005 (in this form) Status: False
  Email text contributed by Ryan C., March 10, 2005:
  By Nolan Strong, allhiphop.com
  'I am gay.' These were the words recording artist Ciara spoke Wednesday night to millions viewers on BET’s 106 and Park in a precedent-setting event for cable television.
  Ciara’s 'coming out' as a lesbian would have been difficult on its own. But also having to admit that she is really a he on national television was cause for celebration among the gay and lesbian community. No major pop singer has ever come out as a transvestite to viewers explicitly after already releasing an album.
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  The email continues, quoting Sean Combs and RuPaul on the topic, and analysis of the status of gay and transgender people in the hip hop community.
  There are many versions of this rumor circulating. For a start, the article cited never appeared on the hip-hop news site to which it's attributed, ALLHIPHOP.com. It's a piece of satire, author unknown, circulating via email since early 2005.
  A disavowal posted on the site not long after the spoof went into circulation read as follows:
  In point of fact, the Ciara-is-a-hermaphrodite rumor had already been dismissed as 'crazy' by ALLHIPHOP.com a month earlier:
  For whatever reason, rumors questioning Ciara's gender and/or sexual orientation have been circulating since late 2004. One version claims the singer 'came out' as a transsexual on The Oprah Winfrey Show , though as of 2005 she had never appeared on Oprah. Another version claims Ciara is actually a hermaphrodite ('one having the sex organs and many of the secondary sex characteristics of both male and female,' as defined by the American Heritage Dictionary ). Yet another claims she is a transvestite (a male who dresses in women's clothing). Another claims she is a lesbian.
  They can't all be true, obviously, and although there is no documentation to prove the allegations false, neither has anyone proven a single one of them true. Indeed, the only 'evidence' ever offered is the claim that Ciara Harris made a statement on television. Hogwash.
  Ciara herself issued a denial published in the New York Daily News under the headline 'No Gender Gap Here':
  R&B sensation Ciara just wants everyone to know: She's all woman. 'You know what's funny? The rumor that I used to be a man,' she told us at the launch party for Vibe Vixen magazine at Frederick's. 'They said Oprah said that on her show,' she laughed. 'I've never been on Oprah in my life - we all know I have years before I go on Oprah, so come on!'

"Alexander Fleming's Discovery of Penicillin","http://inventors.about.com/video/Alexander-Fleming-s-Discovery-of-Penicillin.htm","Alexander Fleming's Discovery of Penicillin","2012-03-14 21:15:16","  Hi, I am William Morgan with About.com, and today I'm going to talk about Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin.
  The popular antibiotic penicillin originated from a penicillium mold that could kill bacteria. Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist, first discovered penicillin in 1928 some time in September. The discovery was made upon examination of a petri dish he had set aside prior to vacation at his country house with his family. Fleming had picked up a dish to demonstrate to a friend the horrid amount of work he had to do to. He then noticed that a mold had grown on it in his absence which had killed the staphylococcus aureus that had been growing on the dish.
  Ever since his discovery of lysozyme, a natural substance in nasal mucus and tears that cleans away bacteria, Fleming had been pursuing the idea that there could be a substance that killed bacteria without adversely affecting the human body. After several weeks growing mold, he and mycologist C. J . La Touche determined the mold to be of the penicillium variety, thus the name penicillin. It is likely the mold floated upstairs from La Touche's room where he had been collecting mold samples for John Freeman, who was researching asthma.
  Running numerous tests, Alexander found that the mold killed a large number of bacteria and was non toxic. Despite the mold's antibacterial qualities, Fleming wasn't able to push the matter further. He wasn't a chemist and couldn't isolate the active antibacterial element or keep the element active long enough for human use. In 1929 he wrote a paper on his discovery that didn't gather any scientific interest.
  It wasn't until twelve years later that Australian pharmacologist and pathologist, Howard Florey and German-born, British bio-chemist, Ernst Chain, who had been conducting experiments on promising projects in bacteriology, came across penicillin and, using modern chemical techniques, produced a brown powder that could keep its antibacterial properties longer than a few days. Mass production skyrocketed. It was the second year of World War II and the antibacterial was extremely valuable for cleaning wounds. Penicillin saved the lives of many veterans who otherwise would have died from infection. Penicillin also treated diphtheria, gangrene, pneumonia, syphilis and tuberculosis. Flemming, Florey, and Chain were all knighted in 1944 and given the 1945 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.

  A poem purportedly written by Maya Angelou criticizes African Americans for buying clothing manufactured by 'racist' companies. This hoax has been circulated online since March 1999.
  A notice posted on Maya Angelou's website in 2004 read as follows:
  Please be aware that Dr. Maya Angelou has absolutely no affiliation with the 'poem' entitled Clothes that is circulating the Internet.
  In an interview with the Detroit Free Press , a representative of Maya Angelou's speakers' agency said: 'It is not her work. She is aware of it, and is very disappointed.' Indeed, it's hard to believe that anyone could possibly mistake the horrendous examples below for Maya Angelou's work.
  Moreover, the content of the text is false and slanderous. Unfounded charges to the effect that apparel designers Tommy Hilfiger and Liz Claiborne are guilty of making racist statements on television have circulated for many years, despite repeated debunkings.
  The Timberland Company, founded by Nathan Swartz in 1973, is still almost completely family-owned, with Swartz's son and grandson controlling 98 percent of the company's stock. The Swartz family, members of whom have spoken publicly of being observant Jews, obviously has no association with the anti-Semitic Ku Klux Klan.

"Why Are People Saying Eminem Died in a Car Crash?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/eminem_dead.htm","Why Are People Saying Eminem Died in a Car Crash?","2006-12-20 17:54:40","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  We read on the Internet on Sunday, Dec. 17 that Slim Shady, aka Eminem , died in a car crash at 2:30 in the morning. According to this article he was on his way to a late-night party and was drunk and high on drugs.
  We can't seem to locate the site. Can you find out if this is true or not? Is Eminem really dead?
  Dear Reader:
  There's a very good reason you can't find the website that says Eminem is dead — it was deleted almost as soon as it went up. Why? Because it was bogus. Another reader forwarded me the URL just before I received your message, but when I tried to access the page — which I'm told was a decent-looking spoof of CNN's online news site — it was nowhere to be found.
  Exactly the same article was posted on a fake MTV page, now deleted as well. Emails containing the URLs and the headline 'Rapper Eminem Dies in Car Accident' began circulating among AOL users on Saturday, but by Sunday the pages were nowhere to be found.

  This was a hit-and-run hoax.

  Here, from an online posting, is the full text attributed to, but not actually published on, CNN:
  December 15, 2000 Web posted at 6:12 a.m. EST (0012 GMT)
  Rapper 'Eminem' Dies in Car Accident.
  Multi-platinum artist Marshall Mathers, known by the stage name 'Eminem', was killed at 2:30AM EST while driving a rental car on his way to a late-night party.
  Mathers, who authorities believe was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was behind the wheel of a Saturn coupe that witnesses say swerved to avoid a slow moving vehicle, then lost control and slammed into a grove of trees.
  The car was crumpled by the impact, making extraction of Mather's body very difficult. He was declared dead on the scene by paramedics who arriced a short time later.
  Authorities would not comment on details surrounding the accident other than to confirm the identity of the victim.
  Mathers was 26.
  The story is clearly false. No legitimate news sources have reported the death of Marshall Mathers, aka Slim Shady, aka Eminem. This denial was posted on Eminem's own website:
  2010 Update: Versions of this hoax have continued to circulate on and off since the earliest postings in 2000. The most recent, as of January 2010, reads as follows:
  TOP STORIES - Rap Singer Eminem died this morning in a terrible car crash. The cause of this horrible accident was blamed for the cell phone that he was using when riding in his car. It is thought that he was not paying attention when he swerved into an oncoming truck.
  He was brought to a hospital in critical condition, but he died from bleeding to death. 'There was really nothing we could do to help him' said Dr. Adams who was taking care of Eminem at the time.We will always remember Eminem from his music and his words. MTV will be having a special memorial program for him.
  'First it's Pac then it's Biggie then Eminem' said Snoop Dogg , another famous rap singer.
  Again, this false rumor has been circulating for years, and shows no signs of going away. Rule of thumb on information contained in forwarded emails: Until you read it in a legitimate news source, consider it crap.

"That Time Donald Trump Paid Off a Guy's Mortgage for Fixing His Car","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/fl/Donald-Trump-and-the-Good-Samaritan.htm","Donald Trump and the Good Samaritan","2015-11-29 20:49:10","  By David Emery
  As told by a reader:
  A mechanic is driving down the street and notices a Mercedes pulled over on the side of the road.  The mechanic pulls over and offers to help the stranded motorist, whom he recognizes to be Donald Trump.  Mr. Trump at first was wary of the man's offer, but as he was stranded he decided to accept.
  The car is fixed in no time, and the man declines Trump's repeated offer of a reward.  Finally, the man gives in and tells the real estate magnate that if he really wants to reward him, would he send flowers to his wife?  It's their anniversary, and she would really get a kick out of that, he says.
  The next day the mechanic's wife receives four dozen roses.  The card, signed by Donald Trump, read: 'Happy anniversary.  By the way, I have paid off your mortgage.'
  As told by a reader:
  A man is driving on a deserted road and comes to see a man on the side of that road with a flat tire. The driver stops his car and offers to help. When he is done, the grateful man asks him for his address to send him a reward for helping him. The helpful man declines and declines, but finally gives in. Then both man get in their cars and drive off.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Two weeks later, the man receives a letter in the mail that says: 'Thank you for helping me, here is a little something to say thanks. Signed, Donald Trump.'
  Inside is a check for $10,000.
  As told by a reader:
  An auto mechanic who specialized in BMWs was driving on Interstate 5 and spotted a BMW on the shoulder of the road, with the driver standing beside it. The mechanic stopped and asked if there was anything he could help with. The driver thanked him and explained that he had called BMW's roadside assistance line and was now just waiting for the BMW person to show up.
  The mechanic offered his business card and explained that he specialized in repairing BMWs, again offering to see if he could help, with no obligation. Perhaps he could save the driver a long wait. Again, he was thanked for the offer and turned down politely.
  He insisted and was finally allowed to look at the car. He found nothing more than a loose wire, reattached it, and the car ran fine.
  The driver turned out to be Bill Gates.
  Mysteriously, the mechanic's house mortgage was fully paid up the next week.
  Analysis: I'm told that billionaire Donald Trump corroborated this story — the version that applies to him, at any rate — during a 2005 episode of Celebrity Apprentice . Good on him.
  While he certainly could be telling the truth, we have reason to be skeptical, however, not least because many other famous people — Bill Gates, Perry Como, Louis Armstrong, Mrs. Nat King Cole and Leon Spinks, to cite just a few — have been named as the grateful celebrity in variants of this selfsame tale told before and after the Trump version began circulating. According to folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand there are versions dating back to the 1950s, when Donald Trump was but a lad.
  True or false, we're drawn to urban legends like these because they humanize larger-than-life public figures we ordinarily only get to observe from afar. For my money, the crucial moment in the narrative isn't when Trump or Bill Gates rewards the good Samaritan for his or her good deed — it comes before that, when the celebrity of choice is revealed to be vulnerable and needing help from a stranger, as if he were an ordinary mortal no different from you or me. The quasi-mythological figure is brought down to earth.
  We love snooty celebrity comeuppance stories for the same reason. We revere the rich and famous, but it's a reverence tinged with envy.

DeHaven, born in 1925, was 24 years old when the photo was taken. Frances Bavier, born in 1902, would have been 47. She retired from acting at the age of 69 in 1972, and died in 1989.

  Example: Excerpt from Universalnoticias.org, Nov. 1, 2014:
  GABRIEL IGLESIAS FOUND DEAD, NOT CONFIRMED BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A HEALTH COMPLICATION.
  Gabriel Iglesias was one of the best standup comedians in the world. His constant touring garnered him international fame and his observational comedy and impressionism provided great comedy gags for the fans. Iglesias’s signature-style Hawaiian t-shirts, jokes about obesity and the smooth story-telling have won him millions of fans. He won numerous awards and accolades, including the key to the city of El Paso. Hector Saldaña dubbed him a “comedy genius.” Funny, charismatic, a people person, the best comedian around were just a few of his many qualities.
  Gabriel Iglesias,  (born July 15, 1976) known profesionally  as Gabriel Iglesias and comically as Fluffy died this Friday for causes that are still not confirmed but it seems to be a health complication. He has four sisters and one brother.
  Analysis: Completely false. Comedian Gabriel 'Fluffy' Iglesias is alive and well and has been actively responding to this hoax via Facebook and Twitter.
  'Seriously?! I must be doing good in life,' Iglesias tweeted the day after the above article went viral. 'More fake #FluffyDied shit popping up.'
  A few hours later he wrote on his Facebook page :
  According to this article below I guess I died Friday and no one decided to tell me. Well, since I'm dead now I guess I can start eating carbs again. It was a good life. Had a great childhood and an amazing career. I traveled the world and got drunk in all 50 states, woooooo! I made a lot of people happy over the years and pissed off most my ex girlfriends in the process. Can't win them all, right? Soooo I guess I want to be buried somewhere people can visit my grave, put pretty flowers and pour diet cokes on my plot. I'm gonna want my estate to buy both plots next to me so that even in death I can stretch my legs. I would love it very much if people were to visit my grave and take selfies with it. Even in death I'm still a social media attention whore, #FarewellFluffy . There should be no charge to visit my grave so don't pay any attention to the shady guy by the gate with the comedy club passes in the new Jaguar trying to raise money by selling tickets to get in the cemetery. U just tell him to go fund himself and he will leave u alone.
  Source of the story was a fake news website
  The hoax originally appeared November 1, 2014 on the fake news website Universalnoticias.org (now deleted), which explained its rather unusual mission as follows (translated from the Spanish by Google):
  The content of this page is not real, it's just a social experiment performed by Canadian students currently enrolled in the Master of Teaching for education in developing countries.
  The experiment attempts to collect vital data that may provide information on the relationship between Third World countries and the content they read. People living in the richest and most powerful countries in the world, tend to read at an early age, culture articles, historical, political, investment articles, health articles in all high value that enriches and humans, these items are the 'good' question. People living in poor countries mostly prefer reading things celebrities, religious articles, cartoons, novels, and her favorite shows are reality shows, these items are considered 'junk'.
  Our experiment is to obtain data items considered good, and comparing the number of visitors compared to trash items.
  By 'trash items' the authors presumably mean articles such as this one falsely declaring Mr. Iglesias dead. We look forward to viewing the results of their 'experiment.' (UPDATE: Apparently the experiment is over. Not long after the article went viral, the entire website was deleted.)

  A 92-year Ginger Rogers -- wait 'til you see this!!
  To all of you younger people.....
  This lady was a headline dancer way, way, way back in the 1930's and 1940's
  Wow! I may want to do this when I'm 92... oh, wait, I can't do this now!
  Watch all the way through, the beginning
  She is 92, her great grandson 29 - watch them dance
  Don't give up after the first minute ... that is the teaser.
  Remember, he is 29; she is 92! Just getting to the age of 92 would be most peoples dream
  Enjoy the show!!!
  She was Fred Astaire’s partner at one time and he got better billing than she did. However, as someone pointed out, she did everything he did and she did it backwards and in high heels. Well, she’s still doing it while poor Fred has been pushing up the daisies for almost a quarter-century now.
  Video: Ginger Rogers Dances Salsa at 92
  Analysis: False. Someone is pulling your leg. Ginger Rogers died at the age of 83 in 1995, so the vivacious senior citizen kicking up her heels in the viral video above is someone other than Fred Astaire's best known movie musical dance partner .
  Nor is the senior citizen in the video 92 years old, it turns out, though her real age, 75, is hardly less impressive. The septuagenarian in question is Sarah 'Paddy' Jones, described in the Times of London as a 'demure British grandmother' who danced away with the first prize in the 2009 season of Tu Si Que Vales ('You Are Worth It'), Spain's equivalent of Britain's Got Talent .
  Mrs. Jones and her salsa partner, Nico Espinoza (40 years her junior but not her grandson, sources say), toured the globe for a year afterward and competed in other televised dance contests, but recently parted ways due to 'tensions' in their relationship, it has been reported. In a March 1, 2011 interview with the Wolverhampton Express & Star , Jones said the search for his replacement is already underway.

"Did JFK Really Tell Germans 'I Am a Jelly Doughnut'?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/jfk_berliner.htm","JFK: 'I Am a Jelly Doughnut' ('Ich Bin ein Berliner')","2003-06-26 15:18:08","  By David Emery
  Did John F. Kennedy make a major German language blunder in his famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' speech in Berlin, Germany?
  The story goes that JFK should have said 'Ich bin Berliner' ('I am a citizen of Berlin'), and that 'Ich bin ein Berliner' really means 'I am a jelly doughnut.' A Berliner is, in fact, a type of jelly doughnut made in Berlin. But was this an error and a source of amusement and embarrassment?
  Notwithstanding reports to the contrary in such prestigious venues as the New York Times and Newsweek , this is truly The Gaffe That Never Was. Experts say Kennedy's grammar was flawless when he uttered those words on June 26, 1963. The phrase had been translated for him by a professional interpreter.
  German-speakers point out that President Kennedy said the phrase absolutely correctly, although possibly with a thick American accent. The German language has subtleties that very few non-native speakers grasp.
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  If President Kennedy had said 'Ich bin Berliner,' he would have sounded silly because with his heavy accent he couldn't possibly have come from Berlin. But by saying 'Ich bin ein Berliner,' he actually said 'I am one with the people of Berlin.' President Kennedy had a German journalist translate the phrase for him, and that journalist coached him at length on exactly how to say the phrase.
  Parenthetically, it is true that in some parts of Germany the word Berliner can just as well denote a certain kind of jelly-filled pastry as a citizen of Berlin. But it is unlikely to have cause confusion in the context. For example, telling a group of Americans that your editor is a New Yorker, would any of them really think you'd confused him with the weekly magazine of the same name? Consider the context.
  Laying decades of misinformation to rest, linguist Jürgen Eichhoff undertook a concise grammatical analysis of Kennedy's statement for the academic journal Monatshefte in 1993. ''Ich bin ein Berliner' is not only correct,' Eichhoff concluded, 'but the one and only correct way of expressing in German what the President intended to say.'
  An actual Berliner would say, in proper German, 'Ich bin Berliner.' But that wouldn't have been the right phrase for Kennedy to use. The addition of the indefinite article 'ein' is required, explains Eichhoff, to express a metaphorical identification between subject and predicate, otherwise the speaker could be taken to say he is literally a citizen of Berlin, which was obviously not Kennedy's intention.
  To give another example, the German sentences 'Er ist Politiker' and 'Er ist ein Politiker' both mean 'He is a politician,' but they're understood by German speakers as different statements with different meanings. The first means, more exactly, 'He is (literally) a politician.'  The second means 'He is (like) a politician.'  You would say of Barack Obama, for example, 'Er ist Politiker.' But you would say of an organizationally astute coworker, 'Er ist ein Politiker.'
  So, while the proper way for a Berlin resident to say 'I am a Berliner' is 'Ich bin Berliner,' the proper way for a non-resident to say he's a Berliner in spirit is precisely what Kennedy said: 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'  In spite of the fact that it can also be the correct way to say 'I am a jelly donut,' no adult German speaker could possibly have misunderstood Kennedy's meaning in context, or regarded it as a mistake.
  The man who actually translated the words into German for JFK is was Robert Lochner , the son of Associated Press correspondent Louis P. Lochner. The younger Lochner, educated in Berlin and a fluent speaker of German, was Kennedy's official interpreter on his visit to Germany. Lochner translated the phrase on paper then rehearsed it with JFK in Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt's office right up to the moment the speech was to be delivered.
  In the interests of international peace and harmony, we can be thankful that the president was well-coached that day before addressing his audience in their native tongue. Otherwise, God forbid, he might have stood before the German people and claimed to be a croissant. Quelle horreur!
  Following are examples of the 'I'm a jelly donut' tale making the rounds via old and new media in recent years:

"Here's What Hunter S. Thompson Really Said About Thieves and Pimps","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/a/hunter_thompson.htm","'Where Thieves and Pimps Run Free'","2005-02-23 15:43:09","  Dear Urban Legends:
  There is a famous quote attributed to Hunter S. Thompson that goes something like this:
  'The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side.'
  I have seen this quote changed to describe many businesses from TV to film to corporate America in general. Do you guys have any idea where this quote came from or toward what business it was originally aimed? You are my only hope.
  Thanks. Dear Reader:
  Fascinating, isn't it, how sardonically true those words ring in all the different contexts you mentioned? And they reek of Hunter S. Thompson, the man touted as the father of Gonzo Journalism, the man who described sports writers (whose ranks he rejoined late in life as an online columnist for ESPN) as 'a rude & brainless subculture of fascist drunks,' and who once said of Bill Clinton, 'He may be a swine, but he's our swine.'
  Arguably, Thompson wasn't really a journalist — he denied it off and on himself — so much as a profane, lyrical, hyperactive critic of American culture. The New Journalism of the early '60s tipped the sacred cow of objective reporting on its ear; Gonzo Journalism — by that I mean Hunter S. Thompson — slaughtered it and tossed it on the barbie.
  So, I began my research under the supposition that Thompson probably did author this bitter indictment of the music industry, a good match in both style and substance to other witticisms credited to him. When I Googled the passage I found it everywhere — usually, though not always, attributed to Thompson. However — and here's a lesson in the pitfalls of online research — out of literally hundreds of instances where the quotation was cited, only a couple of them named a published source, and those were the hardest to find.
  Not to mention there are at least half a dozen variants, to wit:
  Whatever the original words and whoever may have authored them, people have clearly seen fit to freely adapt the passage for their own purposes, and others have repeated those adaptations without questioning their authenticity. The tag line, 'There's also a negative side,' was sometimes included, sometimes not. Other writers were occasionally cited as the author.
  Still, it seemed a safe bet that Thompson was the guilty party, but where and when did he say it? I was beginning to despair I'd have to pore through Thompson's entire oeuvre page by page when I received a response to one of the queries I'd sent out to webmasters asking if they could cite a source. It pointed me to Hunter S. Thompson's book called Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s (New York: Summit Books, 1988).
  There, toward the bottom of page 43 , I hit paydirt:
  Exact quote. The full piece, clearly lambasting the business of TV journalism, was originally published as a bylined column in the San Francisco Examiner on November 4, 1985. It was not about radio, it was not about the music industry, it was not about show business in general nor about the corporate communications industry (though for all we know Thompson might well have agreed that the characterization fits equally well in every case). It was about television. Period.
  As for the phantom tag line, 'There's also a negative side,' it's nowhere to be found in the original article. Nice joke, but Thompson didn't write it.
  I am duty-bound to state the obvious one more time: Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.
  Hunter Thompson didn't; neither should you.

"Is It True That Jennifer Lopez Insured Her Butt for a Billion Dollars?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/celebrities/a/jennifer_lopez.htm","Did Jennifer Lopez Insure Her Butt for a Billion Dollars?","2003-10-11 01:29:43","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  Is it true that Jennifer Lopez insured her butt?
  Dear Reader:
  Thereby hangs a tale. Please bear with me.
  With the possible exception of that work in progress known as Michael Jackson's face, no celebrity body part in recent memory has achieved greater prominence than J. Lo's derriere. It's enthroned on fan websites as an object of veneration. It has inspired a new trend in below-the-waist surgical implants. Gossip columnists have worn out thesauri looking for superlatives to describe it: 'ample,' 'deluxe,' 'abundant,' 'big.'
  There's no getting around it, Jennifer Lopez's personal fame has very nearly been eclipsed by that of her own behind.
  Nor is there any getting around rumors of a comparably deluxe insurance policy. In 1999, tabloids on both sides of the Atlantic — The Sun in London and the New York Post — ran articles claiming that Jennifer Lopez had indemnified her body — her entire body, please note — to the tune of $1 billion.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Although pound-for-pound in these reports the singer's boobs fetched a more generous appraisal than her hiney ($100 million per breast vs. $300 million for legs and buttocks combined, according to the Post ), it wasn't long before word on the street had it that the 'abundant butt' alone was valued at a cool billion.
  Lopez has denied the whole darned thing. I think. I'm not sure.
  'I don't know where they got it from,' she said to reporters when questioned about the tabloid allegations in 1999. 'When I heard the story I thought it was very funny.'
  Noncommittal as that was, it was nowhere near as flaccid as her agent's response: 'At this time we cannot confirm or deny this information.'
  A droopier set of denials I have never read, yet they ran under unequivocal headlines such as 'Lopez Denies Insurance for $1 Billion' and 'Lopez: I'm No Billion Dollar Babe,' so we're obliged to conclude — a posteriori, as it were — that someone at some point must have uttered the words 'It's not true' in front of a journalist.
  Either that, or in Lopez-speak 'very funny' is synonymous with 'false.'
  The closest to a straightforward disavowal I've found in print appeared in an August 2000 interview with BeatBoxBetty.com in which Lopez was asked to name the 'wildest rumors' she had heard about herself.
  'The craziest,' she said, 'was the Billion Dollar Butt one. It was on the front page of the paper, here in New York. I happened to be in New York that week. It was funny.'
  'So you haven't insured your body?' pressed the interviewer.
  'I think that's what I'm trying to say here,' Lopez replied.
  I give up. Draw your own conclusion.

  Dear Urban Legends:
  You are no doubt tired of hearing this, so I will be brief and not waste much of your time. I believe I read an article by Robert Anton Wilson a ways back regarding the Smithsonian or some D.C. museum housing private parts of famous people — John Dillinger, for example. Is there any truth to this folklore?
  Dear Reader:
  No truth that I could uncover. Moreover, the very idea that so august and respectable an edifice as the Smithsonian Institution would house an exhibit of celebrity genitalia rings absurd. They've denied it time and time again.
  'In response to your recent inquiry,' begins a statement from the management of the Smithsonian quoted in Dillinger: The Untold Story (Indiana University Press, 2005), 'we can assure you that anatomical specimens of John Dillinger are not, and have never been, in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution.'
  A spokesperson queried by the New York Times in 1994 put it even more bluntly: 'We have no penises.'

  What about Walter Reed Army Medical Center?
  There's another well-known museum in Washington, D.C., the National Museum of Health & Medicine at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, whose exhibits do boast both celebrity body parts and diseased/abnormal sexual organs. But though it is home to such fascinating oddments as President Eisenhower's gall bladder and John Wilkes Booth's vertebrae, you won't find private parts of famous people anywhere on the premises, I'm told. Specifically, according to the Museum's online FAQ , you won't find the private parts of Prohibition-era gangster John Dillinger:
  The mystery of the posthumous pelvic bulge
  Despite decades of denials, the Smithsonian Institution alone receives over a hundred requests per year for viewings of the purportedly pickled penis, says a report in Maxim magazine.
  There must be a reason for all this prurient interest, and as it turns out one needn't search far to find it. For several years running one of the most popular entries on the now-defunct World Sexual Records website was this question: 'Is it true that John Dillinger had a 20-inch penis?' It's a line of inquiry that goes back at least half a century, I discovered, suggesting that the size of Dillinger's organ has long been an urban legend unto itself.
  It all started, apparently, with the photograph mentioned above showing Dillinger's draped cadaver shortly after he was gunned down by FBI agents in 1934. In it, there appears to be an abnormally large, er, protrusion in the pelvic region — so large a protrusion, in fact (the height of which has been estimated at anywhere from 13 to 28 inches), that one of the pathologists in attendance felt compelled to remove the anomalous appendage and preserve it for posterity.
  Or so the story goes.
  Skeptics have objected all along
  Skeptics have objected all along that the disproportionate protuberance — which isn't even visible in other photographs of the cadaver — could be explained by factors as mundane as a raised knee under the sheet or the placement of the cadaver's arm, etc. It's even conceivable that the entire tableau was staged as someone's idea of a joke. For what it's worth, the official autopsy report makes no mention of a detached or missing penis — in fact, it makes no mention of Dillinger's private parts at all.
  None of which is to say that someone with privileged access to the corpse couldn't have made off with the precious organ between the autopsy and burial and preserved it in formaldehyde; stranger things have happened. There's no shortage of people who claim to have seen it. For that matter, a con artist could have passed off the pickled privates of an imposter as Dillinger's at some point in time, unintentionally giving rise to this very urban legend .
  It isn't too far a stretch to imagine John Dillinger's Penis as a lucrative sideshow attraction back in the day . . . right next to the jar containing Adolf Hitler's Brain.

"Why Are People Saying Tommy Hilfiger Is a Racist?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/tommyhilfiger/a/tommy_hilfiger.htm","Is Tommy Hilfiger a Racist?","2007-04-16 20:59:03","  By David Emery
  Anecdotal reports circulating via email and social media claim fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger made racist statements during an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Despite denials by both Hilfiger and Winfrey, the false rumor continues to spread.
  Forwarded email text December 1998
  Subject: FWD: Tommy Hilfiger hates us...
  Did you see the recent Oprah Winfrey show on which Tommy Hilfiger was a guest? Oprah asked Hilfiger if his alleged statements about people of color were true - he's been accused of saying things such as 'If I had known that African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians would buy my clothes, I would not have made them so nice,' and 'I wish those people would not buy my clothes - they were made for upper-class whites.' What did he say when Oprah asked him if he said these things? He said 'Yes.' Oprah immediately asked Hilfiger to leave her show.
  Now, let's give Hilfiger what he's asked for - let's not buy his clothes. Boycott! Please - pass this message along.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  In other examples, racial epithets were included.
  A whole lot of nice, earnest folks who surely don't consider themselves liars used the Internet to spread a false and libelous rumor about fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger. It comes to them in the form of a forwarded email or a shared social media post. They read it, they either believe it to be true or don't care if it's true, and they pass it on to friends, associates and people they hardly even know with the click of a mouse button or the tap of a share button.
  Knowingly or not, each one of these people becomes a link in a growing chain of scurrilous, hurtful lies. We know they are lies because the parties involved have issued repeated denials.
  Oprah Winfrey addressed the rumor personally during a show broadcast in 1999, summarized on her website as follows:
  Winfrey's exact words were quoted on Tommy Hilfiger's Website:
  Eight years later, on May 2, 2007 Tommy Hilfiger actually did appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show — for the first time, mind you — to put an end to this scurrilous rumor. View the video .
  Hilfiger, also quoted on his own website, stated the following:
  Further putting the lie to this misbegotten rumor are the results of an independent investigation conducted in 2001 by the Anti-Defamation League , which summarized its findings in a letter to Tommy Hilfiger :
  The Anti-Defamation League has received recurring inquiries regarding a number of defamatory rumors that have been spread on the Internet and by word-of-mouth in recent years about you and your company. Based upon our investigation, it is apparent to us that you never made the statements that attribute racist remarks to you. In some cases, the rumor alleges that you appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and made racist remarks, causing a supposedly irate Oprah to ask you to leave. We have concluded that these rumors are completely false, and it is apparent that you never made the statements attributed to you, nor did you appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
  Check the facts before you share a scurrilous email or social media post. All of this information is readily available on the internet. Look it up. There is no excuse for perpetuating this false rumor, for bearing false witness against a neighbor, when the truth is only a few links away.

  Example: As published on Foxnews.es, Oct. 26, 2014:
  BREAKING: 'Brat Pack' Judd Nelson Found Dead in Los Angeles Condo
  Last Updated: 10/26/2014 @ 01:36 AM EST
  BREAKING NEWS: Sources are reporting that Judd Nelson, best known for his roles as John Bender in The Breakfast Club, has been found dead at age 55.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.
  Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.
  The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.
  Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term 'Brat Pack' being coined.
  In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.
  Additional details and information will be updated as it becomes available. This story is still developing.
  Analysis: Judd Nelson is alive and well according to his Hollywood agent Gregg Klein, who not only denied Internet reports of the actor's death on October 26, 2014 but provided a photo of Nelson holding a copy of that day's edition of the Los Angeles Times as proof.
  A fake news story (see screen shot above) claiming Nelson was found dead of unknown causes in his L.A. condo was published on the website foxnews.es, which has no discernible connection to the Fox News channel or FoxNews.com, and no other content aside from this hoax. According to the site's WHOIS record , the domain name is registered to a Uvalde, Texas resident named Fred Post. (Update: that domain name is now for sale.)

  My niece was diagnosed with cancer last year. Once her hair started to fall off, she was depressed and terrified to look in the mirror. She recently asked me why she wasn't pretty like all the other girls. I didn't know how to react. I cut my hair off for her. This Christmas I'll be her mirror.

Jennifer Aniston didn't shave off all her hair (you can see her most recent haircut here ). Nor have I found any public reports of Aniston having a niece who is undergoing treatment for cancer. Given that Aniston has famously eschewed participating in social media altogether, the posting above could not have been issued from a valid account.

  Analysis: Famed lawyer Johnnie Cochran, whose roster of celebrity clients included Michael Jackson, Rosa Parks, Sean 'Puffy' Combs and, most notoriously, O.J. Simpson, died on March 29, 2005 at the age of 67.
  The headstone you see in the image above is not Cochran's, however. For one thing, his first name is misspelled 'Johnny' (Cochran spelled it 'Johnnie'). For another, the 'photo' was obviously created using a website called 'The Original Tombstone Generator' (now defunct) which allowed users to add an inscription of their choice to a standard gravestone image (see screenshot at right).
  The joke, for the benefit of those unlikely few who missed the celebrity trial of the '90s, plays on the opinion held by many that accused wife-murderer O.J. Simpson, though acquitted, was actually guilty and that Cochran, who headed up Simpson's defense team, must have known that even though he helped the former football star beat the rap in court.

  Internet rumors circulating since December 2008 claim voluptuous actress Megan Fox is actually either a man in drag (transvestite), a transsexual, or born a hermaphrodite and underwent surgery later in life to become a female.
  Example #1: As posted on the Internet, June 27, 2009:
  Like similar rumors about actress Jamie Lee Curtis and hip-hop diva Ciara , the claim that 'Transformers' star Megan Fox is a 'transvestite,' 'transsexual,' or 'hermaphrodite' is nothing if not counter-intuitive.
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  The last thing you'd think, looking at Megan Fox, is that she's a man. How, then, to explain scuttlebutt to the contrary making the rounds since late 2008? Chalk it up to a perfect storm of media hype, irony, and satire exacerbated by the actress's own self-deprecating remarks and a surfeit of prurient tongue wagging.
  The undeniable truth is that Megan Fox gave birth to three sons in 2012, 2014, and 2016 with husband Brian Austin Green. To do so would require some original feminine reproductive equipment as medicine had not yet to made this possible for transgender women. While at least one transgender man had given birth at the time, he was born female and still possessed female reproductive organs. Unless the births were faked, Fox was born female.
  The drama unfolded as follows:​ Dec. 2008: GQ magazine lists Megan Fox among 'Men of the Year': Along with the Boston Celtics ('Champions'), Leonardo DiCaprio ('Leading Man'), and Barack Obama ('Game Changer'), among others, GQ honored Megan Fox in its annual ' Men of the Year ' issue in a special category dubbed 'Obsession.' Which oughtn't to have confused anyone, but that is precisely when the phrase 'megan fox is a man' started buzzing up the list of Google's most popular search strings.​ Jan. 2009: Fox says 'I'm a tranny, I'm a man' on national TV: In an attempt to come across as self-effacing during a red carpet TV interview at the Golden Globes ceremony on Jan. 11, 2009, a nervous Megan Fox spewed forth the following:
  Yes, it's obvious she was being sarcastic. It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. But she did say those fateful words. She may regret them. Jan. 2009: Weekly World News announces: 'MEGAN FOX IS A MAN!' On Jan. 14, 2009 the satirical blog (and erstwhile tabloid rag) Weekly World News added insult to self-injury by fabricating a back-story to support a literal interpretation of Fox's own words:
  For the record, Weekly World News is a satirical website. Read the disclaimer : ' Weekly World News articles are drawn from a number of different sources and some are fictitious or satirical. Weekly World News uses invented names in some stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. The reader should suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment.' June 2009: Fox tells Esquire , 'I think people are born bisexual' The icing on the cake was a June 2009 interview in Esquire (actually published in May), in which Megan Fox 'fessed up to being bisexual. Now, clearly, admitting to bisexuality is a far cry from admitting to being a 'man,' or a 'tranny,' much less a 'hermaphrodite.' But given all of the above, this seemingly innocuous confession could not but add fuel to the fire. And so it did. Between May and June 2009, the volume of Google searches on the already-popular keyword phrase 'megan fox is a man' increased tenfold. Let us now separate fact from fiction once and for all: Megan Fox is not a man. Anything you've heard to the contrary is baseless gossip stemming from a series of unfortunate remarks and bad jokes. There's no evidence to support it and no truth to it. At all. Pass that on.

  In this viral tale circulating online since 2010, a purported eyewitness recounts how entertainer Martha Raye took on the role of combat nurse to help save wounded soldiers in the field during a USO tour of the Vietnam war zone in 1967. Though a civilian, she is supposedly the only woman buried in the Ft. Bragg Special Forces cemetery.

  2012 example: Viral text as shared on Facebook, Feb. 8, 2012:
  Remembering Martha Raye....
  I remember her as a funny lady, with a loud voice... didn't know this about her... what an awesome lady...
  The most unforgivable oversight of TV is that her shows were not taped. This is a great story about a great woman. I was unaware of her credentials or where she is buried. Somehow I just can't see Brittany Spears, Paris Hilton , or Jessica Simpson doing what this woman (and the other USO women, including Ann Margaret & Joey Heatherton) did for our troops in past wars. Most of the old time entertainers were made out of a lot sterner stuff than today's crop of activists and whiners.
  The following is from an Army Aviator who takes a trip down memory lane:
  It was just before Thanksgiving '67 and we were ferrying dead and wounded from a large GRF west of Pleiku. We had run out of body bags by noon, so the Hook (CH-47 CHINOOK) was pretty rough in the back. All of a sudden, we heard a 'take-charge' woman's voice in the rear. There was the singer and actress, Martha Raye, with a SF (Special Forces) beret and jungle fatigues, with subdued markings, helping the wounded into the Chinook, and carrying the dead aboard.
  'Maggie' had been visiting her SF 'heroes' out 'west'. We took off, short of fuel, and headed to the USAF hospital pad at Pleiku. As we all started unloading our sad pax's, a 'Smart Ass' USAF Captain said to Martha.... Ms Ray, with all these dead and wounded to process, there would not be time for your show! To all of our surprise, she pulled on her right collar and said..... Captain, see this eagle? I am a full 'Bird' in the US Army Reserve, and on this is a 'Caduceus' which means I am a Nurse, with a surgical specialty.... now, take me to your wounded. He said, 'yes mam.... Follow me.' Several times at the Army Field Hospital in Pleiku, she would 'cover' a surgical shift, giving a nurse a well-deserved break.
  Martha is the only woman buried in the SF (Special Forces) cemetery at Ft Bragg. Hand Salute! A great lady..

  Martha Raye
  Some of you remember Martha Raye very well. A comedian and singer, she, like Joe E. Louis had a large mouth and appeared with Bob Hope, and on other radio programs and usually played supportive roles in comedy films and musicals. She was also loved for the work she did entertaining troops in WWII and Korea.
  Some things you probably did not know about Martha Raye.
  Most of the old time entertainers were made out of a lot sterner stuff than today's crop of activists and whiners.
  It was just before Thanksgiving '67 and we were ferrying dead and wounded from a large GRF west of Pleiku, Vietnam. We had run out of body bags by noon, so the Hook (CH-47 CHINOOK) was pretty rough in the back.
  All of a sudden, we heard a 'take-charge' woman's voice in the rear.

  To all of our surprise, she pulled on her right collar and said ,'Captain, see this eagle? I am a full 'Bird' Colonel in the US Army Reserve, and on this is a 'Caduses' which means I am a Nurse, with a surgical specialty.....now, take me to your wounded'.
  He said, yes ma'am.... Follow me.
  Several times at the Army Field Hospital in Pleiku, she would 'cover' a surgical shift, giving a nurse a well-deserved break.
  Martha is the only woman buried in the SF (Special Forces) cemetery at Ft. Bragg.
  So many have done so much that we hear so little about -- thanks a lot to these people who stand up to be counted.
  Analysis: It's a bit of a challenge separating fact from fiction in Martha Raye's storied life, but here goes.
  Born in 1916, Martha 'Maggie' Raye started her show business career by taking the stage with her parents, a pair of small-time vaudevillians, at the age of three. She made her name as a big band vocalist in the early 1930s, which led to numerous film and national radio appearances over the course of the decade.
  In 1942 she volunteered to serve in the USO, entertaining American troops in Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific over the course of World War II . During the 1950s she sang, danced, joked her way from military base to military base across Korea . Between 1965 and 1973 she made numerous tours of Southeast Asia to entertain U.S. soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War . It was during this period that she earned the reputation of being a rough-and-ready, impromptu combat nurse. Tributes from grateful veterans abound.
  To cite one documented example, Raye canceled a show at a base in the Mekong Delta in mid-October 1966 to help tend soldiers wounded in a Viet Cong attack on Army helicopters. 'American casualties began arriving by 8 a.m. at the small Soc Trang dispensary,' Associated Press reported a few days later. 'Miss Raye, a former nurse, arrived about the same time, dressed in Army fatigues and volunteering for duty.'
  The story continued:
  One of the first things she did was donate a pint of blood to a badly wounded sergeant. Then it was hour after hour of scrubbing and preparing the wounded for surgery, helping the surgeons, changing bandages, and cheering up men awaiting evacuation to field hospitals in Vung Tau or Saigon.
  Miss Raye's show did not go on that night. The next morning she was back at the hospital in her stained fatigues, helping the one doctor and eight corpsmen care for the patients.
  As a result of her extraordinary efforts, President Lyndon Johnson awarded her a green beret and the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces. Raye took to wearing a uniform and beret everywhere she went on subsequent tours of Vietnam, and was fondly known to the troops ever after as 'Colonel Maggie.'
  Whether or not she was actually a trained or licensed nurse is a matter of some dispute, however. The AP story referenced above described Raye as a 'former nurse.' A subsequent article published in 1970 went so far as to state that she had been a registered nurse since 1936 and actually served in that capacity during World War II . It appears this information came from Raye herself, who was quoted as saying, 'I went as a nurse but, being an entertainer, could do both.'
  In her biography of Raye, Take it from the Big Mouth: The Life of Martha Raye , author Jean Pitrone writes that while Raye routinely told people she had worked as a nurse's aide at Cedars of Lebanon (now Cedars-Sinai) Hospital in her youth and 'boasted of being a registered nurse' as an adult, in reality she was neither a registered nor a practical nurse.
  Noonie Fortin, author of Memories of Maggie — Martha Raye: A Legend Spanning Three Wars , concurs:
  In the end, it isn't Martha Raye's credentials that matter most, of course; it's her actions. She was a true patriot and humanitarian who dedicated much of her life to giving joy and succor to American servicemen and women in wartime. In 1993 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bill Clinton. After dying of pneumonia a year later at the age of 78, Raye was buried with military honors , even though a civilian, at Fort Bragg Main Post Cemetery in North Carolina.

  Dialog From a Johnny Carson 'Tonight' Show. His guest was Lee Marvin. Johnny said, 'Lee, I'll bet a lot of people are unaware that you were a Marine in the initial landing at Iwo Jima and that during the course of that action, you earned the Navy Cross and were severely wounded.'
  Lee Marvin's response was: 'Yeah, yeah ... I got shot square in the ass and they gave me the Cross for securing a hot spot about halfway up Mount Suribachi. The bad thing about getting shot up on a mountain is guys getting shot hauling you down. But Johnny, at Iwo, I served under the bravest man I ever knew. We both got the Cross the same day, but what he did for his Cross made mine look cheap in comparison. The dumb bastard actually stood up on Red Beach and directed his troops to move forward and get the hell off the beach. That Sergeant and I have been life long friends.'
  'When they brought me off Suribachi we passed him and he lit a smoke and passed it to me lying on my belly on the litter. 'Where'd they get you Lee?' he asked. 'Well Bob, they shot me in the ass and if you make it home before me, tell Mom to sell the outhouse.'

  Analysis: Despite sundry grains of truth scattered throughout — including the fact that both Lee Marvin and Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan served in the military as Marines during World War II (Keeshan a reservist), and that Marvin really was wounded in the buttocks while storming a beachhead (though it happened in Saipan, not Iwo Jima) — the story above is mostly false as told.
  According to their respective biographies, Marvin had already been injured and shipped back to the United States with a Purple Heart by the time Keeshan entered basic training. They could not have encountered one another in combat. Neither was awarded the Navy Cross.
  At the age of 20, Lee Marvin was a private in the U.S. Marines 4th Division, part of the Allied landing force that invaded the Japanese-held Pacific island of Saipan on July 15, 1944. He was wounded three days later on July 18, spent the next 13 months in Navy hospitals recovering from a severed sciatic nerve, and was discharged in 1945.
  Bob Keeshan signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve shortly before his 18th birthday in 1945. Since the war was all but over by the time he finished basic training, it's unlikely Keeshan ever saw combat before completing his service a year later, let alone attained the rank of sergeant.
  Those old enough to remember Lee Marvin's occasional appearances on TV talk shows up until his death in 1987 will find the manner and spirit of the storytelling reminiscent of the man himself, but it seems unlikely he would have trumpeted such blatant lies about another man's service record over national television, nor have I been able to find any evidence in the form of tapes or transcripts that prove he did so.
  Update: A version of this message circulating since March 2003 includes an addendum claiming that Fred Rogers , host of public television's 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,' was a former Marine sniper (or, in another version, Navy SEAL) with dozens of wartime kills to his credit. This, too, is false.
  Update: Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan died on Friday, January 23, 2004.

  Example: Via http://msnbc.website, Nov. 8, 2014:
  Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34
  Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.
  Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.
  At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man's identity at this time.
  'The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,' said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.
  Born August 26, 1980, Culkin began acting at the tender age of four. At the height of his fame, he was regarded as the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple.
  This story is still developing. More details will be made available once they emerge.
  Analysis: False. Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin has not been reported dead by any official agencies or legitimate media sources. Despite the fact that it originated on a web page with the URL 'http://msnbc.website,' it's neither an actual news site nor does it have any connection with MSNBC News . According to its WHOIS listing , the domain name was registered barely a week before the article was published. Its owner has chosen to remain anonymous.
  Portions of the text were copied verbatim from a previous hoax declaring that '80s 'Brat Pack' actor Judd Nelson was found dead in his Los Angeles condo.
  Nota bene: MediaMass.net is also a hoax
  Some venues are inaccurately reporting that the source of the Culkin death hoax was a Facebook page 'with over one million likes' proclaiming that 'our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.' In point of fact, no such Facebook page exists, or existed. The erroneous reports are based on misinformation purveyed by yet another fake news website called MediaMass.net , which maintains scores of virtually identical pages pre-emptively debunking celebrity death hoaxes.
  For example, the copy on the ' Macaulay Culkin Dead 2014 ' page on MediaMass.net reads as follows:

  Rumors of the actor’s alleged demise gained traction on Thursday after a ‘ R.I.P. Macaulay Culkin ’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American actor’s passing:

"Lou Reed Is Dead?","http://history1900s.about.com/od/people/a/Rolling-Stones.htm","The Rolling Stones","2011-12-18 05:07:00","  The longest performing rock band of all time, the Rolling Stones have greatly influenced rock and roll throughout the decades. Beginning as part of the British Rock Invasion of the 1960s, the Rolling Stones quickly became the “bad-boy” band with an image of sex, drugs, and wild behavior. After five decades together, the Rolling Stones have amassed eight #1 singles and ten consecutive gold albums.
  Dates: 1962 -- Present
  Also Known As: The Stones
  Original Members:
  Current Members:
  The Rolling Stones were a British band, begun in the early 1960s, influenced by American rhythm and blues artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino , as well as jazz musician Miles Davis .

  4 Tips for Improving Test Performance
  However, the Rolling Stones eventually created their own sound by experimenting with instruments and writing rhythm and blues mixed with rock and roll.
  When the Beatles hit international stardom in 1963, the Rolling Stones were right on their heels. While the Beatles became known as the good-boy band (influencing pop rock), the Rolling Stones became known as the bad-boy band (influencing blues-rock, hard rock, and grunge bands).
  In the early 1950s, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger were elementary-school classmates in Kent, England, until Jagger went to a different school.
  Nearly a decade later, their friendship was rekindled after a chance encounter at a train station in 1960. While Jagger was on his way to the London School of Economics where he was studying accounting, Richards was commuting to Sidcup Art College where he was studying graphic art.
  Since Jagger had a couple of Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records under his arm when they met, talk quickly turned to music. They discovered that Jagger had been singing adolescent “love frustration” songs in underground clubs in London while Richards had been playing the guitar since the age of 14.
  The two young men once again became friends, creating a partnership that has kept the Rolling Stones together for decades.
  Looking for an outlet to try out their musical talent, Jagger and Richards, plus another young musician named Brian Jones, began to occasionally play in a band named Blues Incorporated (the first electric R&B band in Britain).
  The band embraced aspiring young musicians with an interest in this type of music, allowing them to perform in cameo appearances. This is where Jagger and Richards met Charlie Watts, who was the drummer for Blues Incorporated.
  Soon, Brian Jones decided to start his own band. To get started, Jones placed an advertisement in Jazz News on May 2, 1962, inviting musicians to audition for a new R&B group. Pianist Ian “Stu” Stewart was the first to respond. Then Jagger, Richards, Dick Taylor (bass guitar), and Tony Chapman (drums) joined as well.
  According to Richards, Jones named the band while on the phone trying to book a gig. When asked for a band name, Jones glanced down at a Muddy Waters LP, saw one of the tracks named “Rollin’ Stone Blues” and said, “Rollin’ Stones.”
  The new band, named Rollin’ Stones and led by Jones, played their first performance at the Marquee Club in London on July 12, 1962. The Rollin’ Stones soon secured a residency at the Crawdaddy Club, bringing in younger audiences who were looking for something new and exciting.
  This new sound, a renaissance of blues performed by young British musicians, had kids standing on the tables, rocking, dancing, and shouting to the sound of electric guitars with a provocative singer.
  Bill Wyman (bass guitar, backing vocals) joined in December 1962, replacing Dick Taylor who went back to college. Wyman wasn’t their first choice, but he had an amplifier the band desired. Charlie Watts (drums) joined the following January, replacing Tony Chapman who left for another band.
  In 1963, the Rollin’ Stones signed with a manager named Andrew Oldham, who had been helping to promote the Beatles. Oldham saw the Rollin’ Stones as the “anti-Beatles” and decided to promote their bad-boy image to the press.
  Oldham also changed the spelling of the band’s name by adding a “g,” making it “Rolling Stones” and changed Richards’ last name to Richard (which Richard later changed back to Richards).
  Also in 1963, the Rolling Stones cut their first single, Chuck Berry’s “Come On.” The song hit #21 on the UK singles chart. The Stones appeared on the TV show, Thank Your Lucky Stars , to perform the song while wearing matching hound’s-tooth jackets to appease television producers.
  Their second hit single, “I Wanna Be Your Man,” written by the Lennon-McCartney songwriting duo of the Beatles, reached #12 on the UK chart. Their third single, Buddy Holly’s “Not Fade Away,” hit #3 on the same chart. This was their first American hit that went to #48 on the American chart.
  The press turned an eye toward the Rolling Stones, a group of brash punks upsetting the status quo by playing black music to young white audiences. A March 1964 article in the British weekly Melody Maker titled, “Would You Let Your Sister Go With a Stone,” created such a stir that 8,000 kids showed up at the Rolling Stones’ next gig.
  The band decided the press was good for their popularity and thus purposely started shenanigans such as growing their hair and wearing casual, mod-style (modified) suits in order to receive more media attention.
  Becoming too big to perform in clubs by early 1964, the Rolling Stones went on a British tour. In June 1964, the band rolled into America to perform concerts and to record at Chess Studios in Chicago as well as the Hollywood RCA Studios, where they captured the vibrant, earthy sound they desired due to better acoustics.
  Their American concert in San Bernardino, California, was well received by excited schoolboys and screaming schoolgirls, even without a major hit record in the States. But the Midwest concerts proved spotty because no one had heard of them. Crowds picked up again at the New York concert.
  Once back in Europe, the Rolling Stones released their fourth single, Bobby Womack’s “It’s All Over Now,” which they had recorded in America at Chess Studios. A fanatical Stones cult began to form after the song hit #1 on the UK charts. It was their very first #1 hit.
  Oldham urged Jagger and Richards to start writing their own songs, but the duo found that writing blues was harder than they expected. Instead, they ended up writing a type of morphed blues-rock, a hybrid of blues with a heavier melody than improvisation.
  On their second trip to America in October 1964, the Rolling Stones performed on the Ed Sullivan TV show, changing the words to “Let’s Spend the Night Together” (written by Richards and Jagger) to “Let’s Spend Some Time Together” due to censorship.
  That same month they appeared in the concert film the T.A.M.I. Show in Santa Monica, California, with James Brown, the Supremes , Chuck Berry, and the Beach Boys . Both venues greatly improved their American exposure and Jagger began to mimic the moves of James Brown.
  The Rolling Stones’ 1965 mega hit, “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” with Richards’ fuzz-guitar riff designed to imitate the sound of a horn section, hit #1 worldwide. Their musical attitude, a mixture of rebellion and irreverence using urgent guitars, tribal drums, forceful harmonicas, and sexually tensed vocals, seduced the young and alarmed the old.
  When the Rolling Stones had another #1 hit, “Paint It Black,” the following year, they had begun to secure their rock-star status. Although Brian Jones had started the band, leadership of the Rolling Stones shifted to Jagger and Richards once they had proved themselves to be a strong songwriting team.
  By 1967, the members of the Rolling Stones were living like rock-stars, which meant they were abusing a lot of drugs. It was in that year that Richards, Jagger, and Jones were all charged with possession of drugs (and given suspended sentences).
  Unfortunately, Jones was not only addicted to drugs, his mental health spiraled out of control. By 1969, the rest of the band members could no longer tolerate Jones, so he left the band on June 8. Just a few weeks later, Jones drowned in his swimming pool on July 2, 1969.
  By the late 1960s, the Rolling Stones had become the bad boys they had once promoted themselves to be. Their concerts from this period, filled with teenagers from the growing counterculture movement (young people experimenting with communal living, music, and drugs), were raucous enough to lead to a number of citations against the Rolling Stones for causing concert violence. Jagger’s Nazi goose-stepping onstage didn’t help.
  By the early 1970s, the Rolling Stones were a controversial group, banned from many countries and exiled from Britain in 1971 for not paying their taxes. The Stones fired their manager Allen Klein (who had taken over from Oldham in 1966) and started their own record label, Rolling Stones Records.
  The Rolling Stones continued to write and record music, mixing in punk and disco genres inspired by new band member Ron Woods. Richards was arrested in Toronto for heroin trafficking, resulting in legal limbo for 18 months; he was subsequently sentenced to perform a benefit concert for the blind. Richards then quit heroin.
  During the early 1980s, the band experimented with the new-wave genre, but members began to pursue solo careers due to creative differences. Jagger wanted to continue experimenting with contemporary sounds and Richards wanted to stay rooted in blues.
  Ian Stewart suffered a fatal heart attack in 1985. In the late 80s, realizing they were stronger together, the Rolling Stones reunited and announced a new album. By the end of the decade, the Rolling Stones were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
  In 1993, Bill Wyman announced his retirement. The Stones’ Voodoo Lounge album won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995 and prompted a world tour. Jagger and Richards agreed that their drifting in the 80s attributed to their success in the 90s. They believe that had they stayed together, they would have broken up.
  The Rolling Stones have endured waxing and waning popularity over the decades. While band members are now in their sixties and seventies in the new millennium, they still perform, tour, and record.
  In 2003, Jagger was knighted to Sir Michael Jagger, causing another riff between himself and Richards, especially, according to Richards, because the band’s message had always been anti-establishment. There was also a public outcry that questioned the appropriateness of knighting a former British tax exile.
  Documentaries regarding the band’s exceptionally long and controversial career capture the counterculture movement, perfecting the technology of recording records, and flamboyantly performing to live audiences.
  The band’s lips and tongue logo, designed by John Pasche in the 70s (a symbol of their anti-establishment message), is one of the most identifiable band icons in the world.

"Magic Johnson Is in a Coma, Near Death","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_magic_johnson.htm","Email: Magic Johnson Is in a Coma, Near Death","2016-02-20 19:03:13","  Description: Email hoax Circulating since: Sep. 2003 Status:  False
  Example: Email text contributed by V. Perrodin, Sep. 22, 2003:
  Thursday, September 18, 2003 Posted: 1810 GMT
  (CNN) -- Former L. A. Laker Earvin 'Magic' Johnson is in a coma tonight at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and is not expected to live. Johnson, 44, is suffering from complications related to HIV, and internal bleeding, a spokesman for Johnson's attorney told CNN. 'His eyes are open, but it's just a dead stare. He could go any day now,' said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used. Johnson was last seen publicly on July 27 in Los Angeles when he hosted 'A Midsummer Night's Magic', a charity basketball event at the Staples center. The 6ft - 9in. Johnson, three-times voted the NBA's most valuable player, was admitted to the intensive care unit last weekend under another name. A hospital spokeswoman refused to confirm reports Johnson was a patient there.
  A press release submitted to media outlets on Sept. 17 announced Johnson's new production company had signed a multimillion-dollar Hollywood movie deal with Warner Bros. Pictures. Johnson, the NBA star-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Magic Hallway Pictures in July with producer Paul Hall, whose credits include 'Higher Learning' and the 2000 remake of 'Shaft.' Hall could not be reached for comment.
  On November 7, 1991, Johnson stunned the sports world when he announced he had tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, during a routine physical exam. Johnson also announced his retirement from basketball but returned in 1992 and again in 1996. He turned his enthusiasm and leadership skills to business. Among his successes, he developed movie theaters and shopping malls in poor and neglected sections of large cities where no one else would invest.
  In September 1991, just before he learned he had HIV, Johnson wed longtime friend Earletha 'Cookie' Kelly. The couple had a son in 1993 and adopted a daughter in 1995. Johnson also has a son from a previous relationship who lives near his estate. Ever optimistic, Johnson believed that the right combination of medicine, diet, and exercise would help him to survive until a cure for AIDS was found.
  Johnson's physicians announced in early 1997 that the AIDS virus in his body had been reduced to undetectable levels. They attributed the improvement to the use of powerful drugs, including protease inhibitors. His wife Cookie gave the credit to God stating, 'The Lord has definitely healed Earvin. Doctors think it's the medicine. We claim it in the name of Jesus.' The Johnsons attended the West Angles Church of God in Christ, to which he donated $5 million in 1995. Calls to the Lakers front office were not returned.
  Analysis: This must surely come as a shock to Mr. Johnson, who was photographed visiting Baltimore to promote his 'Know Your Money' program for minority professionals just days after this 'news story' supposedly broke on September 18, 2003. A photo taken on September 22 shows a happy, healthy-looking retired basketball star.
  It's unknown where the claim that Magic Johnson is on his deathbed originated, but no such item was posted on the CNN website, nor has any other news outlet reported it.
  Johnson was diagnosed with HIV in 1991, but thanks to AIDS-inhibiting drugs the virus remained dormant in his body and he has never exhibited full-blown symptoms of the disease.

  In this common urban legend, a tale of great courage and inspiration, a young man manages to overcome the odds despite a physical handicap.
  The legend is usually shared via email, with something like the below:
  Subject: True Story
  Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully)
  Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was a handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even a stagehand gig came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered  the worse section of town.
  Walking home from work one evening, this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money, the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp. They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road, they assumed he was dead and called the morgue.
  On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all his teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared, he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired.
  When the young man started to look for work again, he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as 'The Man Who Had No Face'. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years.
  One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church, he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life.
  The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.
  The priest, through his personal contacts, was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worst, was filled with good humor and love.
  The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly.
  The young man is Mel Gibson.
  His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie The Man Without A Face . He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.'
  While Mel Gibson certainly has had an interesting life, it is not the stuff of which high drama is made. Born in 1956 in Peekskill, New York, he moved to Australia with his family at the age of 12, but the young man was a loner and a heavy drinker with no particular direction in life.
  It was his older sister, Mary, who set Gibson's future career in motion by submitting an application in his name — and without his knowledge — to the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney. Having nothing to lose, he auditioned and was accepted. He proved to be a talented actor and lived theatrically ever after.
  His first big break in the movies occurred in 1979 when he landed the starring role in a low-budget Australian flick called 'Mad Max,' which soon attracted a cult following. There's an anecdote surrounding this early triumph which presumably inspired our apocryphal email story.
  About a week before the big audition, he got drunk at a party and wound up in a fistfight with three other men. And lost. 'I woke up in the bloody hospital with head stitches, a busted nose, my jaw off the hook, peeing blood,' he recalled in a 1995 Playboy interview. He was 'still a mess' on the day of the audition, but ironically it was his busted-up face that caught director George Miller's attention and won Gibson the part as the film's post-apocalyptic antihero.
  Be that as it may, he did not require a year in the hospital to recover, nor was he left permanently disfigured, nor did he join a circus freak show and spend five years wandering and horribly depressed. On the contrary, he healed quickly, shot Mad Max that same year and went on to become one of the world's most sought-after leading men.
  He did, in fact, later direct and star in The Man Without a Face , the 1993 film adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. In it, he played a reclusive teacher whose face had been horribly scarred as a result of an automobile accident. But the script wasn't based on Gibson's own life, not even remotely. As a matter of fact, the novel from which the film was adapted was first published in 1972.
  Mel Gibson was 16 years old at the time.

  Subject: A MEL GIBSON FILM
  In the New York Times Magazine of Sunday, March 9.2003 it is reported that Mel Gibson is making a film of the last 6 hours of the life of Jesus Christ in which he purports to tell the 'truth', namely that the Jews are responsible for his death!
  This canard has been discredited by all people of good will including the Pope. Yet Gibson, who is a member of an extreme Catholic sect called 'Holy Family' which has distanced itself from the main body of catholicism and is not affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese is using his money and his high profile to finance and film this retrogressive and defamatory story.
  Gibson, whose father, Hutton Gibson is a notorious Holocaust denier and who claims the the World Trade Center was destroyed by remote control and not by alQueda; that the Second Vatican Council was a Masonic plot backed by the Jews and that all popes going back to John XXIII have been illegitimate 'anti-popes'.
  The article goes on much longer and is not refuted by either party. I believe in free speech, but not when it fosters hatred and gives our enemies ammunition to perpetuate the greatest crime of the century and the continued persecution of Jews.
  Four 4000 years we have been blamed for every wrong in the world. We will not tolerate this additional insult.
  I urge you to read the article and also forward this message to all people who you feel should know about this. I, for one will no longer pay my money to see Gibson's films, which support his continued racism
  Example #2: Email text contributed by N. Meyers, March 15, 2003:
  Dear Friends,
  Just this Sunday, there was an article in The New York Times Magazine section about Mel Gibson. He is making a movie about the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. He is going to show that the Jews killed him. He is filming this in Latin and Aramaic with no subtitles.
  He belongs to a group that believes this Roman Catholic Church is too liberal and that things should go back to the way they used to be before 1965 when the church apologized to the Jews for their behavior towards them.He father says that the 'Second Vatican Council was a plot put out by the Jews.'
  Hutton Gibson, his father also believes that 911 happened not by terrorists on planes but by 'remote control'. He also believes that the Holocaust never happened. He says that you cannot dispose of so many bodies and his new wife says 'There weren't even that many Jews in all of Europe.' and then Hutton adds'Anyway, there were more after the war than before.'
  When asked if Jews might be offended by his movie, Mel Gibson says: 'It's not meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth. I want to be as truthful as possible. But when you look at the reasons Christ came, he was crucified- he died for all mankind and he suffered for all mankind. So that, really, anyone who transgresses has to look at their own part or look at their own culpability.'
  FRIENDS PLEASE PASS THIS ON! PLEASE DO NOT GO TO ANY MEL GIBSON MOVIES BECAUSE HE HIS TOTALLY BIASED AGAINST THE JEWS! HIS FATHER SAID THAT ALL OF HIS TEN CHILDREN ARE WITH HIM SO THEY ALL BELIEVE THESE LIES.THE 'PASSION PLAYS' IN GERMANY WERE THE MOST ANTI-SEMITIC PLAYS GIVEN ANNUALLY WITH THE JEWS PORTRAYED AS UGLY AND MISERABLE.BOYCOTT MEL GIBSON AND SPREAD THIS E-MAIL.

  Attorney Hillary Rodham Clinton was born in Chicago and educated at Vassar College and Yale Law School. She served in 1974 as counsel on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee which was considering impeachment of then-President Richard Nixon. She married William Jefferson Clinton. She used her name Hillary Rodham through Clinton's first term as governor of Arkansas, then changed it to Hillary Rodham Clinton when he ran for reelection.
  She was First Lady during Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001). Hillary Clinton managed the failed effort to seriously reform health care, she was the target of investigators and rumors for her involvement in the Whitewater scandal, and she defended and stood by her husband when he was accused and impeached during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

  So don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We’re not. Don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don’t believe anyone who says: “I alone can fix it.”
  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.
  Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. Happy for boys and men, too – because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit. So let’s keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves. Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.
  But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.
  My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States, from my first day in office to my last!
  I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.
  I believe that our economy isn’t working the way it should because our democracy isn’t working the way it should.
  It’s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.
  I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.
  He spoke for 70-odd minutes – and I do mean odd.
  In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.
  Ask yourself: Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump can’t even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he’s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he’s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
  I can’t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started – not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men – the ones moved by fear and pride.
  Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.
  I’m not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment. I’m not here to take away your guns. I just don’t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place.
  So let’s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
  Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger. None of us can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we’ll ever pull together again. But I’m here to tell you tonight – progress is possible.

"Michael Richards' Self Defense","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/a/michaelrichards.htm","Definition of Systemic Racism in Sociology","2014-04-14 21:30:36","  By Nicki Lisa Cole
  Systemic racism is both a theoretical concept and a reality. As a theory, it is premised on the research-supported claim that the United States was founded as a racist society, that racism is thus embedded in all social institutions, structures, and social relations within our society. Rooted in a racist foundation, systemic racism today is composed of intersecting, overlapping, and codependent racist institutions, policies, practices, ideas, and behaviors that give an unjust amount of resources, rights, and power to white people while denying them to people of color.
  Developed by sociologist Joe Feagin, systemic racism is a popular way of explaining, within the social sciences and humanities, the significance of race and racism both historically and in today's world. Feagin describes the concept and the realities attached to it in his well-researched and readable book, Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, & Future Reparations .
  In it, Feagin uses historical evidence and demographic statistics to create a theory that asserts that the United States was founded in racism since the Constitution classified black people as the property of whites. Feagin illustrates that the legal recognition of racialized slavery is a cornerstone of a racist social system in which resources and rights were and are unjustly given to white people and unjustly denied to people of color.
  The theory of systemic racism accounts for individual, institutional, and structural forms of racism. The development of this theory was influenced by other scholars of race, including Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois , Oliver Cox, Anna Julia Cooper, Kwame Ture, Frantz Fanon, and Patricia Hill Collins , among others.
  Feagin defines systemic racism in the introduction to the book:
  While Feagin developed the theory based on the history and reality of anti-black racism in the U.S., it is usefully applied to understanding how racism functions generally, both within the U.S. and around the world.
  Elaborating on the definition quoted above, Feagin uses historical data in his book to illustrate that systemic racism is primarily composed of seven major elements, which we will review here.
  Feagin explains that the undeserved impoverishment of people of color (POC), which is the basis of the undeserved enrichment of white people, is one of the core aspects of systemic racism. In the U.S. this includes the role that Black slavery played in creating unjust wealth of for white people, their businesses, and their families. It also includes the way white people exploited labor throughout the European colonies prior to the founding of the United States. These historical practices created a social system that had racist economic inequality built into its foundation, and were followed through the years in numerous ways, like the practice of 'redlining' that prevented POC from buying homes that would allow their family wealth to grow while protecting and stewarding the family wealth of white people. Undeserved impoverishment also results from POC being forced into unfavorable mortgage rates , being channeled by unequal opportunities for education into low-wage jobs, and being paid less than white people for doing the same jobs .
  There is no more telling proof of the undeserved impoverishment of POC and the undeserved enrichment of white people than the massive difference in average wealth of white versus Black and Latino families .
  Within a racist society, white people enjoy many privileges denied to POC . Among these is the way that vested group interests among powerful whites and “ordinary whites” allow white people to benefit from a white racial identity without even identifying it as such. This manifests in support among white people for political candidates who are white , and for laws and political and economic policies that work to reproduce a social system that is racist and has racist outcomes. For example, white people as a majority have historically opposed or eliminated diversity-increasing programs within education and jobs, and ethnic studies courses that better represent the racial history and reality of the U.S . In cases like these, white people in power and ordinary white people have suggested that programs like these are 'hostile' or examples of ' reverse racism .' In fact, the way white people wield political power in protection of their interests and at the expense of others , without ever claiming to do so, maintains and reproduces a racist society.
  In the U.S., white people hold most positions of power. A look at the membership of Congress, the leadership of colleges and universities, and the top management of corporations makes this clear. In this context, in which white people hold political, economic, cultural, and social power, the racist views and assumptions that course through U.S. society shape the way those in power interact with POC. This leads to a serious and well-documented problem of routine discrimination in all areas of life, and the frequent dehumanization and marginalization of POC, including hate crimes , which serves to alienate them from society and hurt their overall life chances. Examples include discrimination against POC and preferential treatment of white students among university professors , more frequent and severe punishment of Black students in K-12 schools , and racist police practices , among many others.
  Ultimately, alienating racist relations make it difficult for people of different races to recognize their commonalities, and to achieve solidarity in fighting broader patterns of inequality that affect the vast majority of people in society, regardless of their race.
  In his book, Feagin points out with historical documentation that the costs and burdens of racism are disproportionately borne by people of color and by black people especially. Having to bear these unjust costs and burdens is a core aspect of systemic racism. These include shorter life spans , limited income and wealth potential, impacted family structure as a result of mass incarceration of Blacks and Latinos, limited access to educational resources and political participation, state-sanctioned killing by police , and the psychological, emotional, and community tolls of living with less, and being seen as “less than.' POC are also expected by white people to bear the burden of explaining, proving, and fixing racism, though it is, in fact, white people who are primarily responsible for perpetrating and perpetuating it.
  While all white people and even many POC play a part in perpetuating systemic racism, it is important to recognize the powerful role played by white elites in maintaining this system. White elites, often unconsciously, work to perpetuate systemic racism via politics, law, educational institutions, the economy, and via racist representations and underrepresentation of people of color in mass media. ( This is also known as white supremacy .) For this reason, it is important that the public hold white elites accountable for combatting racism and fostering equality. It is equally important that those who hold positions of power within society reflect the racial diversity of the U.S.
  Racist ideology—the collection of ideas, assumptions, and worldviews—is a key component of systemic racism and plays a key role in its reproduction. Racist ideology often asserts that whites are superior to people of color for biological or cultural reasons , and manifests in stereotypes, prejudices, and popular myths and beliefs. These typically include positive images of whiteness in contrast to negative images associated with people of color, such as civility versus brutishness, chaste and pure versus hyper-sexualized, and intelligent and driven versus stupid and lazy.
  Sociologists recognize that ideology informs our actions and interactions with others, so it follows that racist ideology fosters racism throughout all aspects of society. This happens regardless of whether the person acting in racist ways is aware of doing so.
  Finally, Feagin recognizes that resistance to racism is an important feature of systemic racism. Racism has never been passively accepted by those who suffer it, and so systemic racism is always accompanied by acts of resistance that might manifest as protest , political campaigns, legal battles, resisting white authority figures, and speaking back against racist stereotypes, beliefs, and language. The white backlash that typically follows resistance, like countering 'Black Lives Matter' with 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter,' does the work of limiting the effects of resistance and maintaining a racist system.
  Feagin's theory, and all of the research he and many other social scientists have conducted over 100 years, illustrates that racism is in fact built into the foundation of U.S. society and that it has over time come to infuse all aspects of it. It is present in our laws, our politics, our economy; in our social institutions; and in how we think and act, whether consciously or subconsciously. It's all around us and inside of us, and for this reason, resistance to racism must also be everywhere if we are to combat it.

"Miley Cyrus Tested Positive for HIV","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/Fake-News/ss/Fake-News-Miley-Cyrus-Tested-Positive-for-HIV.htm","FAKE NEWS: Miley Cyrus Tested Positive for HIV / AIDS","2014-04-18 17:09:12","  Description: Fake news / Hoax Circulating since: April 2014 Status: FALSE (see details below)
  Example: Via Huzlers.com, April 15, 2014:
  KANSAS CITY - Miley Cyrus decided to cancel her sold out “Bangerz” tour concert in Kansas City before being rushed to the hospital and testing positive for HIV.
  According to Miley’s manager, Miley was suffering from a serious fever, headache, and even vomiting a few times before finally cancelling the show. After, Miley was rushed to the hospital. Seeming like Miley had caught the flu virus at first, It was later revealed that Miley was actually suffering from HIV and not the flu.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: False. Miley Cyrus doesn't have AIDS. This fake news story originally appeared on the website Huzlers.com, which bills itself as 'a combination of real shocking news and satire news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.'
  A state of confusion is more like it.
  Other recent 'scoops' on the less-than-credible site include ' Justin Bieber Admits to Being Bisexual ' and ' 7-Year-Old Eli Moreno Missing After Installing Talking Angela App .'
  There is a small grain of truth behind the hoax, namely that Miley Cyrus was indeed hospitalized on April 15, 2014 after experiencing an allergic reaction to flu medication. The condition was not life-threatening, and though at least two concerts were canceled, the expectation was that the 21-year-old pop singer would finish out the rest of her 'Bangerz' tour as planned.
  A similar hoax claiming Cyrus had contracted HIV made the social media rounds in October 2013.

"Monica Lewinsky Explains Post-Clinton Weight Loss","http://womensissues.about.com/od/influentialwomen/fl/Monica-Lewinsky-Seeks-to-Set-the-Record-Straight.htm","Monica Lewinsky Sets the Record Straight","2014-05-14 13:02:11","  By Susana Morris
  Monica Lewinsky first burst onto the national scene after her affair with then president Bill Clinton was exposed. Since then, Lewinsky has been at the center of an impeachment trial, the butt of jokes, and the target of intense criticism. She has also largely stayed out of the spotlight until 2014, w she broke her decade-long silence with a Vanity Fair article.
  Monica Samille Lewinsky was born in San Francisco, California in 1973. She was raised in the affluent neighborhoods of Brentwood and Beverly Hills, in Southern California where her father, Bernard Lewinsky, is an oncologist, and her mother, Marcia Kaye Vilensky, is a writer. The Lewinskys divorced when Monica was a teen. After attending Bel Air Prep she attended Santa Monica College and then graduated with a degree in psychology from Lewis and Clark College in 1995. She received her master’s degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics in 2006.
  A more detailed profile of Monica Lewinsky can be found on Biography.com.
  Lewinsky is of course best known for her affair with then President of the United States Bill Clinton that took place between 1995 and 1997, and which was outlined in sordid detail in the Starr report . Immediately after the scandal Lewinsky remained in and out of the spotlight. In 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Monica Lewinsky on ABC’s 20/20 to over 70 million viewers and Lewinsky was the subject of an authorized biography, “Monica’s Story.” That same year, Lewinsky launched a (now defunct) line of handbags. The next year she had a short-lived stint as a Jenny Craig spokesperson and as a reality TV host in 2003.  Lewinsky went on to complete graduate studies in 2006 and the largely disappeared from the public eye.
  Lewinsky is no longer the intern with the beret and the infamous blue dress. She is a woman who has had to deal with the fallout and the consequences of her dalliance with one of the most powerful men in the world for her entire professional career.
  In a 2014 Vanity Fair article she wrote, “Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position. . . . The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.”
  Lewinsky admits that employment has sometimes been an issue because of her history and that over the years she has not been able to be a completely private citizen, noting, “she is still recognized every day, and her name shows up daily in press clips and pop-culture references.” She even checks Beyoncé’s grammar in the singer’s recent raunchy hit, “Partition,” quipping, “‘Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we’re verbing, I think you meant ‘Bill Clinton’d all on my gown,’ not ‘Monica Lewinsky’d.’”
  Lewinsky has also called out feminists for what she sees as a betrayal. Some feminists like Jessica Bennett agree, noting that “Long before slut-shaming was a term, Monica Lewinsky was its original target.”
  In other words, because of the propensity to blame women in acts of “deviant” sexuality, Lewinsky stood little chance of being understand with complexity or nuance in the popular imagination or even among some mainstream feminists, such as Susan Faludi and Erica Jong.
  Today Lewinsky claims that she is reemerging from the shadows to take control of her own narrative. She wrote in Vanity Fair , “I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)”
  It was perhaps no coincidence that Lewinsky was back in the news just as rumors of Hillary Clinton’s run for President began. Perhaps this was indeed Lewinsky’s attempt to recalibrate the conversations that center on her. In Rebecca Traister’s piece in the New Republic she wrote, “in offering a refresher on her own story—one surely intended to sell magazines to Hillary-haters everywhere—Lewinsky is exposing many of the dynamics that have stood so uncomfortably between women and power for so very long.”
  Traister’s comments underscores the ways in which Lewinsky’s most recent attempt at reinvention is catalyzing a much needed conversation about women, sex, and power in the face of what could possibly be the first woman president of the United States.
  Ultimately, Monica Lewinsky’s unapologetic call to take control of her legacy should benefit not just herself, but all women.

"Morgan Freeman on Connecticut Shootings?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/ss/Morgan-Freeman-On-Connecticut-School-Shootings.htm","Morgan Freeman on Connecticut School Shootings?","2012-12-17 15:40:04","  Description: Viral quote / Online hoax Circulating since: Dec. 2012 Status: Falsely attributed to Morgan Freeman
  Example: As posted on Facebook, Dec. 17, 2012:
  TURN OFF THE NEWS.......
  Morgan Freeman's brilliant take on what happened yesterday :
  'You want to know why. This may sound cynical, but here's why.
  It's because of the way the media reports it. Flip on the news and watch how we treat the Batman theater shooter and the Oregon mall shooter like celebrities. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris are household names, but do you know the name of a single *victim* of Columbine? Disturbed people who would otherwise just off themselves in their basements see the news and want to top it by doing something worse, and going out in a memorable way. Why a grade school? Why children? Because he'll be remembered as a horrible monster, instead of a sad nobody.
  CNN's article says that if the body count 'holds up', this will rank as the second deadliest shooting behind Virginia Tech, as if statistics somehow make one shooting worse than another. Then they post a video interview of third-graders for all the details of what they saw and heard while the shootings were happening. Fox News has plastered the killer's face on all their reports for hours. Any articles or news stories yet that focus on the victims and ignore the killer's identity? None that I've seen yet. Because they don't sell. So congratulations, sensationalist media, you've just lit the fire for someone to top this and knock off a day care center or a maternity ward next.
  You can help by forgetting you ever read this man's name, and remembering the name of at least one victim. You can help by donating to mental health research instead of pointing to gun control as the problem. You can help by turning off the news.'
  Analysis: Morgan Freeman has denied making the above statements, which apparently originated as a Facebook status update by a non-celebrity user which was shared under false pretenses and went viral within a day of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings on Dec. 14, 2012. Freeman's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, says the actor has made no public statements about the tragedy to date, according to TheWrap.com.

"Mr. Rogers Was a Marine Sniper / Navy Seal","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/fredrogers/a/mr_rogers.htm","Was Mr. Rogers a Navy SEAL or Marine Sniper?","2007-07-07 15:52:29","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  I've been listening to the radio today, and a couple of speakers made mention of the 'fact' that Mr. Rogers was a Marine sharpshooter; some even said he's supposed to have had something like 150 'kills' in the Vietnam War and wore tattoos on his arms to prove it. I don't think that can be true, because I think he was on TV during the war — in any case, he would have likely been too old to serve in Vietnam.
  I was wondering if you'd heard the story, whether it — or any part of it — was true. Dear Reader:
  Unless all the biographical information we have about him is wrong, Fred McFeely Rogers never served in the military in any capacity, much less as a Marine Corps sniper (or Navy SEAL , as another version of this apocryphal story claims). I'm sure some cynical folks are loathe to believe that the gentle, soft-spoken host of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was exactly what he seemed, but he was.
  Rumors of a 'secret past' began circulating in the early 1990s.

  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  It's unknown precisely where these stories originated, or why, but around 1994 Fred Rogers' alleged military exploits suddenly became a hot topic on the Internet, and grew hotter as the decade wore on. Here are some examples:
  1994:
  A note on Mr. Rogers. He would be a tough competitor. He has 42 confirmed sniper kills (in Korea?).
  1998:
  So this fellow at work (retired Army vet) says that Mr. Rogers of childrens' TV fame served three tours of duty in 'Nam as a sniper and has been credited with kills in excess of 1500 meters.
  1999:
  Interesting side note about Fred Rogers. He was the number three Marine sniper in the Vietnam war. And one of the reasons he always wears long sleeve clothing is because his arms are covered in tattoos.
  Predictably, Rogers' death in February 2003 sparked a resurgence of the old rumors, but with a fresh twist: now he was supposedly an ex-Navy SEAL, instead of a former Marine sniper. This variant circulated far and wide after someone attached it to a newer email hoax that made similar claims about Bob 'Captain Kangaroo' Keeshan . The relevant portion of that text, again dated 1993, went as follows:
  Fred Rogers won our hearts, true enough; but the rest of the story as told in this email and elsewhere is hogwash. After graduating from Rollins College in Florida with a degree in music in 1951, he immediately embarked on a broadcasting career — a career that continued uninterrupted for nearly 50 years, even while he was studying for a Bachelor of Divinity degree, by virtue of which he became an ordained minister in 1962.
  Far from hiding a secret past as a trained killer, Mr. Rogers was a truly gentle soul who devoted his entire adult life to educating and bettering the lives of children everywhere, and as such he deserves to be remembered.

"Pat Boone: CBS and 60 Minutes Are 'Modern Benedict Arnolds'","http://middleeast.about.com/od/iraq/ig/Abu-Ghraib-Torture-Photos/","Abu Ghraib Photos of Alleged U.S. Torture and Abuse of Iraqi Prisoners","2009-06-01 12:26:17","  From Bush to Obama, a Scandal Evolving from Outrage to Cover-Up
  On April 28, 2004 -- a year into the American invasion and occupation of Iraq-- CBS' 60 Minutes program broadcast photographs showing American soldiers apparently abusing, humiliating, beating and torturing Iraqi prisoners held at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad.
  Low-ranking members of the Army's 372nd Military Police Company took the fall for the abuse, but declassified Bush administration memos since documented the common use of torture methods on prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.
  Fewer than 300 Abu Ghraib photographs were made public in 2004. President Obama promised to disclose all photographs--then reversed himself, lending the torture scandal a new dimension: a cover-up disguised as protection of American servicemen.
  The following photographs are from the original, 2004 disclosures. Military intelligence forces told members of the Red Cross that between 70 percent and 90 percent of the inmates pictured here were arrested by mistake.
  In civilian life, Ivan Frederick, also known as 'Chip,' pictured here in an implicitly taunting situation with an inmate at Abu Ghraib prison, was a $26,722-a-year prison guard at Buckingham Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in central Virginia, where his wife, Martha, worked in the prison's training department. The prison incarcerates about 1,000 inmates.
  Frederick was sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in prisoner abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib, where he was the senior enlisted man in fall, 2003.
  Former Army Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick, known as Chip Frederick, was a reservist from Virginia who had been a prison guard at Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia. He was the senior enlisted soldier at Abu Ghraib prison in the fall of 2003. It was Frederick who attached wires to a hooded detainee and threatened him with electrocution if he fell off a box--the photograph became the iconic representation of the Abu Ghraib scandal--who forced prisoners to masturbate and simulate oral sex, and who sat on top of a prisoner sandwiched in between two medical litters while posing for a photograph, among other abuses.
  Frederick was court-martialed in Baghdad. He pled guilty to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault, and indecent acts. He was originally sentenced to 10 years, reduced to eight as part of a pre-trial agreement, with loss of pay and dishonorable discharge.

  Hussein Mohssein Mata Al Zayidai, Abu Ghraib Detainee #19446, 1242/18, gave the following sworn testimony:
  “I was in the solitary confinement, me and my friends. We were treated badly. They took our clothes off, even the underwear and they beat us very hard, and they put a hood over my head. And when I told them I am sick they laughed at me and beat me. And one of them brought my friend and told him “stand here” and they brought me and had me kneel in front of my friend.
  They told my friend to masturbate and told me to masturbate also, while they were taking pictures. After that they brought my friends, Haidar, Ahmed, Noun, Ahzem, Hashiem, Mustafa, and I, and they put us 2 on the bottom, 2 on top of them, and 2 on top of those and one on top. They took pictures of us and we were naked. After the end of the beating, they took us to our separate cells and they opened the water in the cell and told us to lay face down in the water and we stayed like that until the morning, in the water, naked, without clothes. Then one of the other shift gave us clothes, but the second shift took the clothes away at night and handcuffed us to the beds. [...]
  Q: How did you feel when the guards were treating you this way? A: I was trying to kill myself but I didn't have any way of doing it. Q: Did the guards force you to crawl on your hands and knees on the ground? A: Yes. They forced us to do this thing. Q: What were the guards doing while you were crawling on your hands and knees?
  A: They were sitting on our backs like riding animals. Q: When you were on each other, what were the guards doing? A: They were taking pictures and writing on our asses. Q: How many times did the guards treat you this way? A: The first time when I just go in, and the second day they put us in the water and handcuffed us. Q: Did you see the guards treat the other inmates this way. A: I didn't see, but I heard screams and shouts in another area.

  Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigation reports widespread use of dogs as a means of terrorizing prisoners:
  'The first documented incident of abuse with dogs occurred on 24 November 2003, just four days after the dogs teams arrived. An Iraqi detainee was smuggled a pistol by an Iraqi Police Guard. While attempting to confiscate the weapon, an MP was shot an the detainee was subsequently shot and wounded.
  Following the shooting, LTC Jordan ordered several interrogators to the Hard Site to screen eleven Iraqi Police who were detained following the shooting. The situation at the Hard Site was described by many as “chaos,” and no one real appeared to be in charge. The perception was that LTG Sanchez had removed all restrictions that night because of the situation; however, that was not true. No one is able to pin down how. that perception was created. A Navy Dog Team entered the Hard Site and was instructed to search for additional weapons and explosives. The dogs searched the cells, no explosives were detected and the Navy Dog Team eventually completed their mission and left. Shortly thereafter, [dogs] were recalled when someone “needed” a dog.'
  At one point, 'one of the men said words to the effect 'You see that dog there, if you don’t tell me what I want to know, I’m gonna get that dog on you!' [...] Even with all the apparent confusion over roles, responsibilities and authorities, there were early indications that MP and Military Intelligence personnel knew the use of dog teams in interrogations was abusive.'
  The report includes the documented case of a dog biting an inmate on Dec. 12, 2003. At the time, the inmate 'was not undergoing an interrogation and no MI personnel were present. [The prisoner] told [a guard] that a dog had bitten him and [the guard] saw dog bite marks on [the prisoner's] thigh. [...] This incident was captured on digital photograph ... and appears to be the result of MP harassment and amusement, no MI involvement is suspected.'
  Coalition forces and military intelligence told the International Committee of the Red Cross that between 70 percent and 90 percent of the inamtes in Iraqi prisons were innocent--picked up by mistake.
  One such case was Hayder Sabbar Abd, prisoner #13077, the man in the hood in the photograph above. He is being taunted and humiliated by former pfc. Lynndie England. The New York Times' Ian Fisher tracked down Abd after his release in May 2004.
  'The shame is so deep,' Fisher wrote , that 'Abd says he feels that he cannot move back to his old neighborhood. He would prefer not even to stay in Iraq. But now the entire world has seen the pictures... pointing out the key figures, starting with three American soldiers wearing big smiles for the camera.'
  'The truth is we were not terrorists,' Abd said. 'We were not insurgents. We were just ordinary people. And American intelligence knew this.'
  According to Abd, the father of five children and a Shiite Muslim from Nasiriya, he had served 18 years in the Iraqi military, at times in the Republican Guard, but was demoted to the regular army after several desertions. He was arrested in June 2003 at a military checkpoint when he tried to walk away from the taxi he was riding in. He was held for three months and four days in a prison in southern Iraq before being transferred to Abu Ghraib. He was never charged and never interrogated.
  In a sworn statement to military investigators, Abd said:
  'After they took off my clothes the American soldier removed who was wearing glasses, night guard, and I saw an American female soldier which they call her Ms.
  Maya, in front of me they told me to stroke my penis in front of her. [...] They were laughing, taking pictures, and they were stepping on our hands with their feet. And they started taking one after another and they wrote on our bodies in English. I don’t know what they wrote, but they were taking pictures after that. Then, after that they forced us to walk like dogs on our hands and knees we had to bark like a dog and if we didn’t do that, they start hitting us hard on our face and chest with no mercy. After that, they took us to our cells, took the mattresses out and dropped water on the floor and they made us sleep on our stomachs on the floor with the bags on our head and they took pictures of everything.'
  From Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigation:
  'There is also ample evidence of detainees being forced to wear women's underwear, sometimes on their heads. These cases appear to be a form of humiliation, either for [Military Police] control or for [Military Intelligence} 'ego down.''
  [...]
  'A photograph taken on 17 October 2003 depicts a naked detainee chained to his cell door with a hood on his head. Several other photographs taken on 18 October 2003 depict a hooded detainee cuffed to his cell door.
  Additional photographs on 19 October 2003 depict a detainee cuffed to his bed with underwear on his head. A review of available documents could not tie these photos to a specific incident, detainee or allegation, but these photos reinforce the reality that humiliation and nudity were being employed routinely enough that photo opportunities occurred on three successive days. [Military Intelligence] involvement in these apparent abuses cannot be confirmed.'
  The investigation notes: 'There is no record of an Interrogation Plan or any approval documents which would authorize these techniques. The fact these techniques were documented in the Interrogation Report suggests, however, that the interrogators believed they had the authority to use clothing as an incentive, as well as stress positions, and were not attempting to hide their use. [...] It is probable that use of nudity was sanctioned at some level within the chain-of-command. If not, lack of leadership and oversight permitted the nudity to occur.
  Having a detainee raise his hands to expose himself in front of two females is humiliation and therefore violates the Geneva Conventions.'
  In fact, the secret Bush administration memos released by the Obama administration in 2009 show that the Bush Justice Department had approved abuse and torture methods including denying inmates sleep for 11 days, forced nudity, spraying detainees with 41-degree water, and confining detainees in small boxes. Some of those methods were used at Abu Ghraib, others at secret 'black sites' and in Afghanistan.
  Maj. Gen. George R. Fay's investigative report states: 'A photograph taken circa 27 December 2003, depicts a naked DETAINEE-14, apparently shot with a shotgun in his buttocks. This photograph could not be tied to a specific incident, detainee or allegation and Military Intelligence involvement is indeterminate.'
  A February 2003 International Committee of the Red Cross report noted that 'Since March 2003, the IRC recorded, and in some cases witnessed, a number of incidents in which guards shot at persons deprived of their liberty with live ammunition, in the context either of unrest relating to internment conditions or of escape attempts by individuals.'
  One of the iconic photographs of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal shows an inmate, who became known in military investigation documents as 'DETAINEE-25,' covered in mud and what appears to be feces. The inmate's story is among the most tragic at Abu Ghraib. He was known by his captors to have severe mental disabilities--known to be inclined to self-abuse. His captors encouraged the acts, providing him with implements with which to abuse himself, parading him, encouraging him and photographing him.
  The inmate had no value to military intelligence. His presence at Abu Ghraib was unjustified, his treatment an abject crime.
  Mag. Gen. George Fay's report states:
  'A 18 November 2003 photograph depicts a detainee dressed in shirt or blanket lying on the floor with a banana inserted into his anus. This as well as several others show the same detainee covered in feces, with his hands encased in sandbags, or tied in foam and between two stretchers. These are all identified as DETAINEE-25 and were determined by CID investigation to be self-inflicted incidents.
  Even so, these incidents constitute abuse; a detainee with a known mental condition should not have been provided the banana or photographed. The detainee has a severe mental problem and the restraints depicted in these photographs were allegedly used to prevent the detainee from sodomizing himself and assaulting himself and others with his bodily fluids. He was known for inserting various objects into his rectum and for consuming and throwing his urine and feces. Military Intelligence had no association with this detainee.'
  The question remains: what was a detainee with such severe mental disabilities doing at Abu Ghraib prison to start with, and in a ward of the prison where none of the personnel was professionally equipped to deal with mentally disabled inmates?
  According to Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigative report into Abu Ghraib abuses, 'The use of nudity as an interrogation technique or incentive to maintain the cooperation of detainees was not a technique developed at Abu Ghraib, but rather a technique which was imported and can be traced through Afghanistan and GTMO [Guantanamo Bay]. As interrogation operations in Iraq began to take form, it was often the same personnel who had operated and deployed in other theaters and in support of GWOT, who were called upon to establish and conduct interrogation operations in Abu Ghraib.
  The lines of authority and the prior legal opinions blurred. They simply carried forward the use of nudity into the Iraqi theater of operations. The use of clothing as an incentive (nudity) is significant in that it likely contributed to an escalating 'de-humanization' of the detainees and set the stage for additional and more severe abuses to occur.'

"Penus Van Lesbian","http://humor.about.com/od/bestofthebest/a/Bill-Murray-Effortless-Internet-Icon.htm","How Bill Murray Became A Web Legend Without Even Trying","2012-10-21 14:51:18","  By Beverly Jenkins
  Bill Murray has been making us laugh since his Saturday Night Live days in 1975. His career has been long and successful, and in recent years he has managed to appeal to a whole new (younger) audience by becoming a big deal on the internet. What's interesting is not just that he doesn't care about his internet fame (he genuinely couldn't give a you-know-what), but that he hasn't done a single thing to court it. He doesn't even have an official Twitter or Facebook page, yet he has remained not only relevant in today’s web-centric world, but he has gained even MORE popularity among young people. HOW?
  Step One: Be Yourself.
  Here's the thing: by all accounts Bill Murray is naturally a pretty regular guy, and he refuses to operate like your typical Hollywood actor . He's hard to get a hold of; he doesn't have an agent, an assistant, or a manager. If you want Bill to be in your movie, you must call his 1-800 phone number and leave a message. Yes, really .
  continue reading below our video
  Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows
  Maybe he'll listen to your message, maybe he won't. If he's interested, he'll give you a call back. This method can cause the occasional bit of confusion. Bill famously misunderstood one movie premise and ended up signing on to be the voice of Garfield the cat , for instance. Twice .
  Step Two: Be Awesome To Fans.
  Bill Murray internet lore is full of stories where he pops up at a random places and acts like everybody's BFF. He once crashed a bachelor party and gave a moving speech about finding true love. He crashed a wedding and once hosted an epic Christmas party featuring a vodka ice luge. He even showed up in a New York City park to play some kickball with random people. He has been spotted jumping behind the bar in Austin, TX to pour drinks for the locals. He escorted a young woman to a dance in Scotland. He has been busted driving golf carts pretty much everywhere.
  ”Nobody's Going To Believe You.”
  There are so many Bill Murray fan encounters circulating online that it’s impossible to tell which are real and which are fake. One of the most famous encounters has been an internet staple for a few years and is roundly believed to be fact. A young man claims that he was eating in a Wendy’s restaurant when Murray walked over to him, took a fry from his tray, and said to him, “Nobody's going to believe you.” He then walked away as if nothing had happened. Inspired by this story, there is a whole website devoted to similar Murray run-ins, though many of the tales on Bill Murray Stories are wishful fan fabrications.
  Step Three: Don't Be Mainstream.
  In 2012 a fake (but convincing) Bill Murray parody account popped up on Twitter. Overnight, more than 150,000 people followed the account before it was revealed to be a fraud. When Twitter deleted the page, fans were really upset to learn that they did not, in fact, have a new way to correspond with the Ghostbusters and Caddyshack celeb who has starred in some of our favorite funny movies of the past few decades.
  The fact of the matter is, Bill doesn't want or need social media attention. It just doesn't matter to him. Take that, Kardashians (and every other celebrity )!
  Step Four: Don't Try Too Hard. Or, You Know, At All. Don't Try At All.
  Bill Murray proves that sometimes being awesome is enough. Instead of tweeting his every thought, he simply shows up and interacts with his fans wherever he happens to be that day . He just does what he wants to do, when he wants to do it. He's having fun, and shouldn't the internet be fun? Of course it should.
  Bill Murray has always been cool, but now that he’s a web phenomenon without even trying to be, he has moved beyond “awesome” to living legend status.

"Phil Mickelson's Gambling Debts","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/mickelson_debt.htm","Phil Mickelson's Gambling Debts","2008-04-17 15:26:24","  By David Emery
  Netlore Archive: Did pro golfer Phil Mickelson really rack up a $200,000 gambling debt betting on his own performance in a practice round against three other players in Augusta, Georgia?
  Description: Internet hoax / April Fools joke Circulating since: April 2008 Status: False
  Example: Email contributed by a reader, April 9, 2008:
  MICKELSON'S GAMBLING DEBTS CAUSE UPROAR AMONG AUGUSTA MEMBERS
  Last week Phil Mickelson was playing a practice round at Augusta and went away from protocol and convinced his playing partners to up the stakes in the usual $1 game. It was Mickelson versus the other three which included some of the deepest pockets among the membership. The stakes: $5000 skins and a pot of $130,000, $100,000 of which was contributed by Mickelson for the low net score - Mickelson would play off scratch.
  According to one of the threesome which obviously will remain anonymous, 'everything was going great until the back 9 when Mickelson really could not believe the good fortune of 'chuckie'. He was draining everything on the greens and when he missed the green twice he had two chip-ins. Phil's lead on the scorecard looked safe but in the clubhouse we added it up and lo and behold, Phil owed $200,000.' And then it got ugly. The stories by witnesses conflict, but in effect Mickelson tried to pass the bets off as laugh on the first tee and insisted 'there was no way he would bet hundreds of thousands on golf.' Mickelson believed the standard one dollar game was in effect.
  The threesome was having none of it and before you know it the foursome was sitting in the office of Billy Payne who was none too happy about the loud conversations taking place in the dining room. But even in the privacy of the office, Mickelson was being very difficult. According to the same anonymous member: 'Phil slipped up and admitted that he initiated the stakes and set the terms of the bet. Then he protested at having to pay so much and offered 30 cents on the dollar right then and there, take it or leave it. Billy was aghast and told Phil, you will arrange to pay every dollar or you will never be welcome at Augusta again, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. Mickelson tried to protest and even made a snide remark that Billy couldn't stop him from being welcome at Augusta every April. Billy simply asked are you taking it or leaving it.'
  Mickelson later called his accountant with the banking details of 'chuckie' and an arrangement was made for a wire transfer of an undisclosed amount. The worse of this may not be over as the other member of the threesome was upset enough to call the PGA Tour. When contacted for a comment, the PGA Tour declined to comment and would not even acknowledge whether or not they have been contacted about the conflict at Augusta National.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Analysis: Tales of golfers' gambling exploits are legion, and PGA pro Phil Mickelson has a more storied reputation than most. 'Mickelson is ... known as a player who seldom — if ever — backs off from a challenge,' wrote the late Don Wade in Wanna Bet? The Greatest True Stories About Gambling on Golf , 'and that includes a bet.' Wade recounted a 1998 incident in which Mickelson and his partner John Huston laid a side-bet against their opponents in a practice round on who could score the most birdies. Mickelson and Huston walked away with $27,000.
  That said, as always, it's our task to differentiate between the legendary and the just plain false, and the story before us, in which Mickelson supposedly racked up a $200,000 debt during a 2008 practice round in Augusta, Georgia, is the latter — just plain false. It was an April Fools' Day joke, in fact, concocted by person(s) unknown and distributed on the Internet with a bogus attribution to ' GolfWeek Insider.'
  'Not true,' responded Golfweek editor Jeff Babineau in an April 9 posting on the Golfweek Tour Blog. 'As the editor of Golfweek , I can assure that nobody at our magazine or website had anything to do with the ruse, which was posted, go figure, on April 1.'

  The World Cup soccer (football) tournament is one of the world's biggest sports events and is held every four years. The 2010 World Cup is being played in South Africa. Every World Cup generates a wide range of pop music recorded in celebration of the event and to support national teams. These are 10 of the top songs for World Cup 2010.
  Born in Somalia, K'Naan moved to Canada in his early teen years. His song 'Wavin' Flag' was first released in March of 2009. The song was chosen to be reworked into a Canadian charity single for Haiti in early 2010 recorded by Young Artists for Haiti. That version of 'Wavin' Flag' debuted at #1 on the Canadian pop singles chart. Coca-Cola chose K'Naan's 'Wavin' Flag' as their official theme for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The song was re-recorded yet again as a 'Celebration Mix' for the event. Thus far K'Naan's 'Wavin' Flag' has only reached #99 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100, but it has gone to #2 at home in Canada and most recently it landed at #3 on the UK pop singles chart.

"Robin Williams Paid Christopher Reeve's Medical Bills","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_christopher_reeve.htm","Did Robin Williams Pay Christopher Reeve's Medical Bills?","2016-03-27 14:15:07","  Description: Rumor Circulating since: 1996 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by T. Karr, Oct. 15, 2004:
  Subject: Christopher Reeve (fwd)
  From Biran Fernandez - a friend of Christopher Reeve and his family.
  Most folks are not aware that when Chris Reeve was injured, he had no medical insurance. You can imagine the costs were staggering and his family was caught in a difficult position. Without fanfare or publicity, someone stepped forward and paid all of his medical bills from the day of the accident until recently. His name? Robin Williams. This isn't urban legend - we know the family.
  Next time you see Robin Williams, remember there is an amazing heart of gold under that wild and crazy exterior. And he never asked for recognition or favor for his incredible support.
  The rumor that his lifelong friend, comedian Robin Williams, had promised to pay all of Reeve's medical bills began circulating within six months of the 1995 riding accident. It gained international currency thanks to the British tabloids, one of which, the Sunday Mirror , reported in early 1996 that Williams had secretly handed Reeve a 'blank cheque' for 1.5 million pounds. According to the London Daily Star , the two had made a pact when they were struggling acting students at Juilliard some 22 years earlier to the effect that whoever made it big first would help the other. The story was picked up by U.S. wire services, which noted that Reeve's health insurance benefits were expected to run out later that same year.
  That report was, to put it charitably, premature. Two years later, the Toronto Star was still reporting that Reeve's medical expenses were 'quickly approaching the limit that his actors' union insurance will pay.' But by then, the unstoppable Reeve, though still severely hampered by his disability, was making a steady income from speaking engagements, a book contract, acting appearances and directing films.
  Rumor denied by both Reeve and Williams
  From the start, both Reeve and Williams denied the rumor that the latter was paying all of Reeve's medical bills. Reeve did so through his agent in a San Francisco Chronicle article dated January 31, 1996. Williams did the same in an interview on the TV show 'Extra' on February 12, 1996.
  Not that Williams and Reeve's other show business pals didn't help out in smaller ways from time to time. 'We bought Chris a van and a generator,' Williams told The Mirror in 1999. 'It was really frightening because where Chris and his family live in Connecticut the winters are very harsh. One night the generator they had for Chris crapped out, so there was Chris's wife Dana outside in the middle of the night trying to hand-crank the thing. Now Chris has his own income because of his book, his record and various other sources so he's financially independent and pays his own bills.'
  Gift of laughter
  Williams' most valuable contributions, Reeve attested again and again, were the simple gifts of friendship and laughter. At a tribute dinner in 1995, he described his first reunion with the comic in a hospital room five days after the accident that left him paralyzed:
  'I was hanging upside down, and I looked and saw a blue scrub hat and yellow gown and heard this Russian accent. There was Robin Williams being some insane Russian doctor. I laughed, and I knew I was going to be all right.'
  Update: Robin Williams died on August 11, 2014.

"Robin Williams' Plan for Peace","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/a/stalin_quote.htm","Stalin: 'It Isn't the People Who Vote that Count...'","2006-03-08 20:15:20","  By David Emery
  Dear Urban Legends:
  Consider the following quote, if you will, which people on the Web have been tossing around like a towel in a men's room ever since Florida disrupted our national slumber for the second time in a year (the other time being the Elian thing):
  'It's not the people who vote that count. It's the people who count the votes.' ( Joseph Stalin )
  Now, I don't want to sound too obvious here ... But has anyone ever wondered why a man who a) never had to stand for election for anything, b) never had to hold an election for anything, and c) would ordinarily never give a crap about anything to do with elections in general since he was a TOTALITARIAN DICTATOR... would even care about votes at all?
  I mean, it's not like the guy needed anyone's votes for anything. In terms of being undemocratic and thoroughly unconcerned with elections, you'd be hard pressed to find a better poster boy for electoral indifference than Stalin. He had 20 million Russians murdered just because he could, which by itself makes Hitler, Idi Amin and Slobodan Milosevic all look like a bunch of kids sitting around on a playground busting toy pistol caps with a rock.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Now, if someone like, say, Papa Doc Duvalier, or William Marcy Tweed of Tammany Hall fame or Fernando Marcos said something like that — or better yet, if Slobodan Milosevic or even Hitler said something like that — this would be a really powerful quote! (Tweed did say something similar — I think his quote was roughly 'As long as I count the votes, what are you going to do about it?') And all the guys I mention in this paragraph at least pretended to have an election.
  But since our boy Stalin pretty much acquired his political power using the Machiavelli playbook and to the best of my knowledge (I could be wrong here) never once stood for election, I find this quote to be highly suspect, and thus a potential Net hoax. If you essentially got the top job in the Soviet Union through internal Communist political intrigue and mayhem, why would you logically make a statement like this?
  So my question is: Do you have a reliable source to attribute it to, as opposed to just someone's website? I'd love to know.
  Dear Reader:
  (UPDATE: A published source for this quote has been found. See addendum below.)
  The quoted passage is indeed frequently attributed to 'our boy' Stalin, but I have yet to find a citation confirming he ever actually said it.
  Your arguments against its likelihood aren't completely lacking in merit, but they are based in part on an erroneous assumption. Granted, Stalin never faced a nationwide popular election, but he did have to cope with the Communist Party Central Committee , which periodically cast votes on membership, policy, and leaders. Though Stalin was able to negate the Central Committee's authority when it suited him, he did so by carrying out brutal reprisals against those who voted contrary to his wishes, not by controlling how the votes were counted.
  It's conceivable that Stalin uttered such a statement in the context of a broad polemic against capitalist politics. Marxists are prone to assume, after all, that the real power in capitalist countries resides permanently in the hands of the monied elite, hence so-called 'democratic' elections are presumed to be bogus. Who counts the votes? Those who already have the power. In this light, the quote can be read as a blanket condemnation of what Stalin surely regarded as a thoroughly corrupt political system.
  It bears noting that more than one version of the attributed statement exists. For example, this more formal variant is cited at least as often as the one we've been discussing: 'Those who cast the votes decide nothing; those who count the votes decide everything.' Neither variant shows up in standard quotation dictionaries. I checked with About.com's experts in 20th Century History and Russian Culture, both of whom told me they're unaware of sources authenticating such a remark. A search of the Stalin Internet Library yielded nothing resembling the quote in the Soviet leader's published writings, though the possibility remains that it could have been excerpted from an unpublished speech or private conversation.
  Lastly, I explored the possibility that Stalin has been wrongly credited with someone else's witticism. The closest matches I could find by other public figures weren't quite close enough, however. In addition to the Boss Tweed remark mentioned above, I found the following line from Tom Stoppard's philosophical play , Jumpers , first produced in 1972: 'It's not the voting that's democracy; it's the counting.'
  A similar but different thought.
  Update: A historical source has been found for one version of this quote. The source is Boris Bazhanov's Memoirs of Stalin's Former Secretary , published in 1992 and only available, so far as I know, in Russian . The pertinent passage, which appears near the end of chapter five, reads as follows (loosely translated with the help of Google):

  According to viral messages circulating online since early 2012, it's a little-known fact, supposedly, that actor Tom Hanks' father, Amos Hanks, was the lead singer of a famous vocal quartet of the late fifties and early sixties called The Diamonds.

  Okay, I'll bet you didn't know what you are about to read, even though you are exceptionally smart, unless you have seen this before.
  INCREDIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW TOM HANKS DAD WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF THE DIAMONDS WAY BACK IN 1957! THEY SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME AS THEY DID!
  2 Performances 47 years apart
  FYI, the lead singer of the Diamonds is also the father of TOM HANKS.
  If you were alive in 1957, and old enough to enjoy Rock and Roll, you will probably remember the group, 'The Diamonds' who had just launched their super hit 'Little Darlin''. For you that are too young to remember - it was a time when the performers were happy, enjoying themselves, respecting their fans, dressed appropriately and their lyrics could be understood. They did not feel obligated to scream, eat the microphone, mumble inaudible lyrics or trash the set.
  In 1957, The Diamonds had a hit with 'Little Darlin'. 47 years later, they were requested to perform at Atlantic City ... This link leads to both performances.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: Nice story, false from start to finish. Tom Hanks ' father was never a singer, much less a member of The Diamonds, a Canadian vocal group famous in the late fifties and early sixties for such Top 40 hits as 'Little Darlin'' and 'The Stroll.'
  The Diamonds' original lead singer was Dave Somerville, a native of Ontario, Canada with no known familial connection to Mr. Hanks. He's alive and well, and still performing as 'Diamond Dave Somerville.' (The other original members were Ted Kowalski, Phil Levitt, and Bill Reed, none of whom fathered Tom Hanks.)
  According to Biography.com, Hanks' actual father, Amos Hanks, was a chef. The actor himself has variously described the elder Hanks as an 'itinerant cook' and a restaurant owner who thought his son should follow in his footsteps. 'My dad was in the restaurant business his entire life,' Hanks told the New York Times in 2002, 'and he honestly couldn't fathom why I didn't want to be the assistant manager of the local Jack in the Box.'
  Hanks also mentioned his father's profession in a 1986 interview in which he talked about what life was like after his parents divorced when he was four years old. 'I lived with my dad most of the time,' he told the Dallas Morning News . 'He was a restaurant owner and we lived all over California, wherever he kept opening up restaurants. He remarried many times. It wasn't boring.'
  Thomas Jeffrey Hanks caught the acting bug in junior college while watching a performance of Eugene O'Neill's The Ice Man Cometh and never looked back.
  Amos Mefford Hanks, who spent most of his life in the restaurant business and at no time was a member of a Top 40 singing quartet, died in Alameda, California in 1992. He was 67.

"Rush Limbaugh on Compensation of 9/11 Victims vs. Military Families","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_rush_limbaugh.htm","Rush Limbaugh on Compensation of 9/11 Victims vs. Military Families","2015-05-11 17:26:36","  Description: Email flier Circulating since: April 2002 Status: Authentic (this version)
  Email example contributed by Dwight M., Apr. 12, 2002:
  The Truth Is
  Rush Limbaugh
  I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the September 11th casualty and those who die serving the country in uniform are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country.
  If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million. If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000, direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt.
  Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185, million up to $4.7 million, are complaining that it's not enough.
  We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11th families are getting.
  In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well. You see where this is going, don't you? Folks, this is part and parcel of over 50 years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad.
  Analysis: The above text, which went into email circulation in April 2002, has been confirmed by Rush Limbaugh as an accurate transcription of a monologue he delivered on his radio show March 11, 2002.
  Another version includes inaccurate remarks concerning Congressional pensions and Social Security which were not written or spoken by Limbaugh. The apocryphal comments were lifted from an unrelated email flier circulating since 2000.
  Limbaugh's figures above are roughly correct. As of June 2004, the compensation paid out to surviving family members of civilians who died in the 9/11 terrorist attack averaged $2 million per victim. By contrast, the families of American military personnel killed in combat typically receive a lump sum of $12,000 (as of November 2003; the amount was $6,000 when Limbaugh delivered his monologue in 2002), a burial allowance of up to $3,000, and ongoing monthly payments of $833 and $211 for surviving spouses and dependent children under 18 years of age, respectively.

"Ronald Reagan: Grace Under the Scalpel","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/historical/a/ronald_reagan.htm","Ronald Reagan: Grace Under the Scalpel","2004-06-06 17:08:03","  I RECEIVED a note from reader Mike Ambrose, whose comments inspired an intriguing course of research into events following would-be assassin John Hinckley's attempt on Ronald Reagan's life in 1981:
  So, what's the truth of the matter? Notwithstanding media reports at the time, it's now clear from eyewitness testimony (including that of Reagan himself) that the gravely wounded President was indeed only semi-conscious at best as he was wheeled into the emergency room after the assassination attempt . In his memoir, An American Life , Reagan remembers:
  But it's also true that fully an hour went by between the moment Reagan was delivered to the emergency room and when he was anesthetized for surgery — time enough for him to regain enough composure to utter the famous quip.
  In fact, by all accounts, Reagan turned into a veritable joke machine during the hour-long wait.
  'All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia'
  The first words he uttered upon regaining consciousness were to a nurse who happened to be holding the president's hand. 'Does Nancy know about us?' he quipped.
  When Nancy herself arrived a few minutes later, Reagan greeted her with the comment, 'Honey, I forgot to duck.' (He was quoting prizefighter Jack Dempsey, who had said the same thing to his own wife after losing the heavyweight championship to rival Gene Tunney in 1926.)
  Reagan even found occasion to pay homage to W.C. Fields. When a nurse asked him how he was feeling, he responded, 'All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.' (The original line, which Fields had proposed for his own epitaph, was: 'On the whole, I would rather be in Philadelphia.')
  And, according to Edwin Meese, Reagan's Attorney General, the President stumped him and other members of the White House staff with the greeting, 'Who's minding the store?' (Fortunately, no one told him it was Al 'I'm in charge here' Haig.)
  But the coup de grace, the witticism most repeated and best remembered from that day, was delivered by the President as he was being moved from gurney to operating table just before surgery.
  That he looked up at his surgeons and jokingly expressed the hope they were Republicans has been confirmed by eyewitnesses, and is pretty much beyond doubt. But the precise words he used vary depending upon who is telling the tale:
  None of the above are firsthand accounts, of course. And although we might hope and expect to find more agreement in the testimonies of those who were actually present in the operating room, alas, we do not.
  The head surgeon speaks
  Dr. Joseph Giordano, who headed the George Washington University Hospital trauma team that operated on Reagan, recollected the incident in a Los Angeles Times article just a few days after it happened. His version of events, corroborated by Reagan's personal physician, who was also in the room, was later recapped in Herbert L. Abrams' book, The President Has Been Shot , as follows:
  Reagan's own version, reported years later in his memoir, An American Life , differs only slightly, though in a manner that's especially interesting from a storytelling perspective:
  On the question of credibility, let's be frank. The surgeon, Giordano, was lucid, focused and in command when this incident took place; President Reagan, by all accounts including his own, was weak and groggy. Giordano told the story less than a week after it happened; Reagan didn't write it down until many years later. The odds favor Giordano.
  That's show biz
  But consider, if it were up to you to choose one and only one verbatim account, which you would want for a screenplay of these events:
  It's a no-brainer. As a set-up for Giordano's response, Reagan's line works far better when phrased in the singular and addressed to the head surgeon alone. Indeed, the whole couplet, as rendered by the President, evinces a polish that only an expert storyteller could give it, while Giordano's version comes across as clunky, but, well... real.
  They didn't call Reagan 'The Great Communicator ' for nothing.

  Father's Day post attributed to Ryan Gosling claims he became a father for one year after adopting the 9-month-old son of a friend who had died of cancer.

  Example: As shared on Facebook, June 15, 2014:
  Ryan Gosling
  This father's day, I've decided to tell the story of how I became a father. This little guy was only 9 months old when I became his dad. His mom and I were great friends before she passed away from cancer. I promised her, I'd always look after him. So, I had decided to step up and become his dad. He brought me so much joy. He was my everything. 1 year later after the adoption, his biological father wanted him. Of course, I put up a fight, but he won. That 1 year of being his father taught me how to love unconditionally. We have to stop and be thankful for our children and children should stop and be thankful for their parents. What I truly learned most of all is, every child needs love. Save thousands of children and meet me while doing it bit.ly/RGofficial

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  Analysis: The first question one should ask oneself about this feel-good story is how such a closely watched celebrity as Ryan Gosling could have adopted a child and parented it for an entire year without anybody knowing it. Seems rather unlikely to me.
  The second question to ask oneself is whether the Ryan Gosling Facebook page on which the message was originally posted actually belongs to Ryan Gosling himself. Again, unlikely. The closest thing there is to an official Ryan Gosling Facebook presence is a generic fan page 'automatically generated based on what Facebook users are interested in, and not affiliated with or endorsed by anyone associated with the topic.' It has been liked by over a million people. By contrast, the page on which the adoption story was posted has fewer than 175,000 likes, and smacks of fakery.
  The third question one should ask is why the link following the sentence 'Save thousands of children and meet me while doing it' goes to a website offering t-shirts for sale.
  I have no doubt that Ryan Gosling is a fine human being, maybe even just the sort to adopt and raise a dying friend's child, but there is nothing in the way of real-world evidence to support the notion that this post was actually written by Ryan Gosling, or that anything of the kind really happened.

  The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, known as ILGWU or ILG, was founded in 1900. Most of the members of this textile workers' union were women, often immigrants. It began with a few thousand members and had 450,000 members in 1969.
  In 1909, many ILGWU members were part of the ' Uprising of 20,000 ,' a fourteen-week strike. The ILGWU accepted a 1910 settlement that failed to recognize the union, but that did gain important working condition concessions and improvement in wages and hours.
  The 1910 ' Great Revolt ,' a strike of 60,000 cloakmakers, was led by the ILGWU. Louis Brandeis and others helped bring the strikers and manufacturers together, resulting in wage concessions by the manufacturers and another key concession: recognition of the union. Health benefits were also part of the settlement.
  After the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire , in which 146 died, the ILGWU lobbied for safety reforms. The union found its membership increasing.

  Left-wing socialists and members of the Communist Party rose to considerable influence and power, until, in 1923, a new president, Morris Sigman, began to purge communists from union leadership positions. This led to an internal conflict, including a 1925 work stoppage. While the union leadership battled internally, the manufacturers hired gangsters to break a long 1926 general strike on the part of a New York local led by Communist Party members.
  David Dubinsky followed Sigman as president. He had been an ally of Sigman's in the struggle to keep Communist Party influence out of the union's leadership. He made little progress in promoting women to leadership positions, though union membership remained overwhelmingly female. Rose Pesotta for years was the only woman on the executive board of the ILGWU.
  The Great Depression and then the National Recovery Act influenced the union's strength. When the industrial (rather than craft) unions formed the CIO in 1935, the ILGWU was one of the first member unions. But though Dubinsky did not want the ILGWU to leave the AFL, the AFL expelled it. The ILGWU rejoined the AFL in 1940.
  Leadership of the ILGWU, including Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, were involved in the founding of the Labor Party. When Hillman refused to support purging communists from the Labor Party, Dubinsky, but not Hillman, left to start the Liberal Party in New York. Through Dubinsky and until he retired in 1966, the ILGWU was supportive of the Liberal Party.
  In the 1970s, concerned with declining union membership and the movement of many textile jobs overseas, the ILGWU spearheaded a campaign to 'Look for the Union Label.'
  In 1995, ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union ( ACTWU ) into the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees ( UNITE ). UNITE in turn merged in 2004 with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) to form UNITE-HERE.
  The ILGWU's history is important in labor history, socialist history, and Jewish history as well as labor history.

"Did Tom Jones Insure His Chest Hair?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/a/tom_jones.htm","Did Tom Jones Insure His Chest Hair?","2008-02-08 20:29:30","  By David Emery
  Um, that thing you heard on the news about Tom Jones insuring his chest hair for $7 million? Think twice before passing it along.
  I spoke to a representative of Lloyd's of London who told me no such policy was issued.
  A note from Tom Jones' management on the singer's official website confirmed it: 'No such insurance policy exists or has ever been considered,' it said.
  In point of fact, the story is based on years-old scuttlebutt about a policy supposedly written up for an anonymous male celebrity who didn't, in the end, even purchase the coverage.
  Here, via the Miami Herald, is the story in a nutshell :
  continue reading below our video
  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Bypassing sundry repetitions on AOL, Fox News and elsewhere, let's turn straight to the London tabloid cited above as the origin of the report, the Daily Mirror :
  Uh-huh. And whom does the Mirror credit as its source? One 'body hair mole' -- name and credentials withheld -- whose expert testimony is quoted as follows: 'Like a vintage wine, Tom just gets better with age. Even at the grand old age of 67, the ladies love his hip-thrusting moves and catching a sneaky peak of his famously rugged chest hair.'
  Yes, that's the sum total of it. They could just as well have quoted my mother.
  The New York Daily News , at least, made a halfhearted attempt to give the story a solid footing:
  I, too, scoured the Lloyd's of London website, where there is indeed (or was -- it has since been removed) an article originally published in October 2006 quoting underwriter Jonathan Thomas as saying he once drafted a policy to cover an anonymous celebrity's chest hair.
  But the story wasn't new, even in 2006.
  Googling further, I discovered several stories referring to Mr. Thomas and his most unusual insurance policy dating back as far as 2004 -- including one in which the celebrity chest hair supposedly being underwritten belonged to 'an unnamed male model.'
  Needless to say, the publicity folks at Lloyd's have gotten extraordinary mileage out of this legendary policy, which, though drafted, was never actually purchased, they admit. So, how did Tom Jones' name become associated with it? I suspect it was the result of a misreading (or misrepresentation?) of a few sentences uttered by Jonathan Thomas in one of those puff pieces published in 2004. I quote from an article distributed by Agence France-Presse in which it is stipulated that the draft was 'speculative,' and that Thomas was never told the name of person for whom it was written:
  Clearly, the policy itself wasn't the only thing speculative on Thomas' part. So was his mention of Tom Jones as an example of a celebrity 'famously woolly' enough to actually benefit from such protection.
  That, my friends, is how urban legends begin.
  Nearly all of the articles cited above bring up another much-discussed celebrity insurance policy, the one Jennifer Lopez supposedly took out on her famous derriere. Real, or myth?
  'Myth,' decreed Jonathan Thomas in a 2005 interview with Risk & Insurance . Thank God someone in a position to know finally got to the bottom of it .

  2002 UPDATE: This ancient (by Internet standards) rumor was jolted back to life by Steve Burns' permanent departure from the Blue's Clues TV show in April 2002. Needless to say — or is it? — it's still not true. Steve Burns is alive and well.
  Dear Urban Legends:
  I don't have any direct experience with this one, but a coworker mentioned that he was watching The Today Show or Good Morning America or some other breakfast TV show, and heard that there was a rumor going around that Steve Burns (Steve from the Nick Jr. show Blue's Clues ) was dead.
  Apparently, panicked parents were calling and emailing the producers by the hundreds. The morning TV show had both the producer of Blue's Clues and Steve himself as guests to debunk the rumor. True?
  Dear Reader:
  Nothing puts a crimp in your day like finding out you're dead, but Steve Burns is used to it. In countless newspaper interviews and TV appearances since 1999, he's had to deny kicking the bucket.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  For some reason the public just won't buy it. People seem to want to believe Steve Burns is dead.
  The claim that he succumbed to a heroin overdose first popped up on the Internet in 1998, according to a message from the producers of Blue's Clues , the kids' TV show that made him famous. No one knows precisely how or why the rumor began, but at one point it was spreading so fast that Burns' own mother heard it from a friend and frantically phoned him to make sure it wasn't true (see details from E! Online).
  The whole episode is unsettlingly similar to fellow actor Scott Baio's experience earlier that same year. Baio's parents called him, sobbing, after hearing rumors that he'd perished in a car crash the same day comedian Chris Farley died. Everyone seemed absolutely convinced of Baio's death, except the 'deceased' himself.
  'After a while,' he told New York Times Magazine , 'I started answering the phone, 'I'm not dead.''
  If it had been me, I'd have left a chiding message on my answering machine and refused to pick up the phone until the hysteria passed. How many times a day do you want to have to tell people you're not dead? Even one is too many.

  Hilfiger, also quoted on his own website, stated the following:
  Further putting the lie to this misbegotten rumor are the results of an independent investigation conducted in 2001 by the Anti-Defamation League , which summarized its findings in a letter to Tommy Hilfiger :
  The Anti-Defamation League has received recurring inquiries regarding a number of defamatory rumors that have been spread on the Internet and by word-of-mouth in recent years about you and your company. Based upon our investigation, it is apparent to us that you never made the statements that attribute racist remarks to you. In some cases, the rumor alleges that you appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and made racist remarks, causing a supposedly irate Oprah to ask you to leave. We have concluded that these rumors are completely false, and it is apparent that you never made the statements attributed to you, nor did you appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show .

  Rapper Snoop Dogg converts to Mormonism
  By Aaron Nichols CNN
  DIAMOND BAR, California (AP) -- In what some may consider an unexpected move, rap artist 'Snoop Dogg' has reportedly converted to Mormonism after nearly a year of study with the fast-growing, Utah-based faith.
  {PHOTO CAPTION: Snoop Dogg says he 'can't get enough of the Book of Mormon.'}
  In a statement, a spokeswoman for Snoop Dogg -- whose real name is Calvin Broadus -- said he considers himself extremely fortunate to have discovered such a deep sense of spiritual fulfillment at this stage in his life.
  “Mr. Broadus is also very pleased to find that his family is as enthusiastic about attending church services as he is,” the spokeswoman said.
  However, Snoop Dogg has not been enthusiastic about publicly sharing his experience and declined to be interviewed by CNN for this article.

  In fact, he reportedly informed producers of his E! reality show 'Snoop Dogg's Father Hood' that this particular aspect of his family's life was off-limits to the cameras. Still, he left open the possibility of addressing the subject in future episodes.
  According to the Associated Press, Snoop Dogg was first introduced to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is officially known, after attending a Gladys Knight concert in an LDS meeting house in Los Angeles.
  Knight, who very publicly discusses her conversion to Mormonism several years ago, invited Snoop Dogg to what is known to the Mormon faithful as “Family Home Evening,” a church program that encourages families to set aside Monday evenings for gospel-centered lessons and family togetherness.
  Though Snoop Dogg has been hesitant to publicly discuss his recent spiritual journey, he commented on the experience of attending his first “Family Home Evening” in a recent interview with People Magazine.
  “I was hooked from the start,” Snoop Dogg said. “We talked about the purpose of life, played Mousetrap, and ate brownies. The kids thought it was off the hook, for real.”
  In what Snoop Dogg now thinks was anything but a coincidence, Mormon missionaries had knocked on his door just one week before the Knight concert. He said he had initially turned them away because of what he knew about the strict Mormon health code, which prohibits members from smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs.
  “Y’all know me,” he said grinning broadly. “There were just certain things the old me -- the 'natural man' -- needed to do. And these young guys are telling me that God’s not down with disrespecting ourselves. But it’s cool now.”
  Snoop Dogg said his conversion marks the end of his old life, one that included frequent run-ins with the law. Snoop Dogg was convicted in 1990 of cocaine possession and charged with gun possession after a 1993 traffic stop. In 1997, he pleaded guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence.
  In 1996, Snoop Dogg was acquitted of murder after a purported gangbanger was killed by gunfire from the vehicle in which Snoop Dogg was traveling.
  Snoop Dogg dismisses critics who claim his conversion is intended to placate a Salt Lake County judge, before whom he is appealing an alleged probation violation.
  “Listen, the haters will say what they will,” Snoop Dogg said. “I can only do what I feel is right.” ---------------------------------------

  Example: Email text contributed by Barry G., Aug. 17, 2006:
  THE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY STEVEN SPIELBERG Please forward if you agree........... August 1st 2006 Dear Mr. Gibson, I am one Jew who doesn't accept your apology today. I don't accept it, because you have spit on the graves of the Goldwyns, the Warners, the Mayers, the Cohns, the Foxes, the Thalbergs, the Selznicks, the Zukors and the thousands of other Jews both living and dead who have made your questionable career possible. When you do get out of 'rehab' and recount your millions, please consider how much of your fortune you would have if you had made your true feelings known, when you were starting out in the film industry. You are a despicable human being, one that doesn't even have the sense to realize that he has repeatedly bitten the hand that fed him. Whatever you (or your publicity agents) say today, does not even begin to redress your long standing theories about the Jewish people. Apparently the apple does not fall far from the tree. If you haven't yet distanced yourself from your father's views of the Holocaust, why should the Jewish community meet with you, or believe anything you have to say now. Your words are a thinly veiled attempt to admit that you really messed up this time, and you want to cover yourself, so that you can continue to be adored and further your revenue stream. The truth is, you are an unreformed, unrepentant anti semite of the worst kind, and your hollow outreach is worth less than the price of your next drink, which will surely find itself in your hands before long. I'm buying. Of course, if I am wrong, you could start by donating $1,000,000 today to the State of Israel in her time of need. Surely that is a small public relations price to pay for a man of your stature who 'honors all of God's children'. Steven Spielberg New Rochelle, NY
  Who did write it remains a mystery  all the more so because some copies are signed 'Steven Silberberg' instead of 'Steven Spielberg.' In any case, Spielberg the film director resides in southern California, not New Rochelle, New York. One would assume he knows his own address.
  To date, Mr. Spielberg has not spoken publicly about Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade following his arrest for drunken driving in July 2006 ('The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world,' he reportedly said to the arresting officer. 'Are you a Jew?'), nor his subsequent apology , so we don't know to what extent, if any, Spielberg might agree with the sentiments expressed in the letter falsely attributed to him. Apart from a strongly worded statement by show biz agent Ari Emanuel calling for the industry to 'shun' Mel Gibson, the bright lights of Hollywood have, for the most part, remained mute on the subject.

"Steven Spielberg to Make Film on the Crusades","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_spielberg_crusades.htm","Steven Spielberg to Make Film on the Crusades","2014-09-22 16:39:38","  Description: Email hoax Status: False Circulating since: March 2004 Analysis: See below
  Email example contributed by Brenda R., 13 March 2004:
  Spielbergs Answer to Gibson's Passion:
  Hollywood Mega-hit Producer and Director Steven Spielberg has decided to fight fire with fire. Hes announced that since Mel Gibson is fueling the fires of anti-semitism in the world with his movie about the last hours of Christ, Spielberg will make a graphic movie about the Crusades.
  In order to get Jews and Moslems to convert to Christianity, Spielberg commented, Christians went through Europe and into the Middle East forcing conversions on non-believers. Along the way they raped, beat, bludgeoned, maimed, tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children. I will show Christian brutality in a realistic and most graphic and gory way.
  Spielberg went on to add that the movie will have a well-deserved anti-Christian tone. Lets face it, Gibson wants to blame the Jews for the death of one person we didnt even kill. I will show the inhuman brutality of thousands of Christians against hundreds of thousands of people of other faiths, about which historically there is no ambiguity as to who is to blame.
  Spielberg said that if this movie is successful, he is likely to follow it up with The Spanish Inquisition,a historical film on the torture and murder of the Jews of Spain by the Catholic Church. To complete the trilogy,Spielberg announced, in 2006 I will be filming Hitler and the Pope: A Team Formed in Hell. That should generate some heated debate.
  Comments: This is a joke, if not a particularly amusing one, as can be easily verified by searching for news stories stating that Steven Spielberg is planning a film about the Crusades. There are none. In fact, the only thing Spielberg has said to the press about Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ' is that he will reserve his response to the allegedly anti-Semitic film for Gibson's ears alone.
  'When I do see the film, the first person who will hear from me will be Mel Gibson and no one else,' he told the Hollywood Reporter on March 4, 2004. The anonymous email above, falsely claiming that Spielberg (misspelled 'Speilberg' in some versions) has already ranted publicly about the film, began circulating approximately one week later.
  Calling it a 'vicious, totally fabricated story,' the director's spokesperson, Martin Levy, confirmed in an email that the rumor is baseless. 'Nothing could be further from the truth,' he said. 'Anyone who knows Mr. Spielberg would know that he is dedicated to doing what he can to rid the world of hatred and intolerance wherever it exists.'

"Tommy Hilfiger: Racist?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/tommyhilfiger/a/tommy_hilfiger.htm","Is Tommy Hilfiger a Racist?","2007-04-16 20:59:03","  By David Emery
  Anecdotal reports circulating via email and social media claim fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger made racist statements during an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Despite denials by both Hilfiger and Winfrey, the false rumor continues to spread.
  Forwarded email text December 1998
  Subject: FWD: Tommy Hilfiger hates us...
  Did you see the recent Oprah Winfrey show on which Tommy Hilfiger was a guest? Oprah asked Hilfiger if his alleged statements about people of color were true - he's been accused of saying things such as 'If I had known that African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians would buy my clothes, I would not have made them so nice,' and 'I wish those people would not buy my clothes - they were made for upper-class whites.' What did he say when Oprah asked him if he said these things? He said 'Yes.' Oprah immediately asked Hilfiger to leave her show.
  Now, let's give Hilfiger what he's asked for - let's not buy his clothes. Boycott! Please - pass this message along.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  In other examples, racial epithets were included.
  A whole lot of nice, earnest folks who surely don't consider themselves liars used the Internet to spread a false and libelous rumor about fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger. It comes to them in the form of a forwarded email or a shared social media post. They read it, they either believe it to be true or don't care if it's true, and they pass it on to friends, associates and people they hardly even know with the click of a mouse button or the tap of a share button.
  Knowingly or not, each one of these people becomes a link in a growing chain of scurrilous, hurtful lies. We know they are lies because the parties involved have issued repeated denials.
  Oprah Winfrey addressed the rumor personally during a show broadcast in 1999, summarized on her website as follows:
  Winfrey's exact words were quoted on Tommy Hilfiger's Website:
  Eight years later, on May 2, 2007 Tommy Hilfiger actually did appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show — for the first time, mind you — to put an end to this scurrilous rumor. View the video .
  Hilfiger, also quoted on his own website, stated the following:
  Further putting the lie to this misbegotten rumor are the results of an independent investigation conducted in 2001 by the Anti-Defamation League , which summarized its findings in a letter to Tommy Hilfiger :
  The Anti-Defamation League has received recurring inquiries regarding a number of defamatory rumors that have been spread on the Internet and by word-of-mouth in recent years about you and your company. Based upon our investigation, it is apparent to us that you never made the statements that attribute racist remarks to you. In some cases, the rumor alleges that you appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and made racist remarks, causing a supposedly irate Oprah to ask you to leave. We have concluded that these rumors are completely false, and it is apparent that you never made the statements attributed to you, nor did you appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
  Check the facts before you share a scurrilous email or social media post. All of this information is readily available on the internet. Look it up. There is no excuse for perpetuating this false rumor, for bearing false witness against a neighbor, when the truth is only a few links away.

"Paula Deen Hired by Fox News? No, It's Satire.","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/ss/Paula-Deen-Hired-By-Fox-News.htm","Paula Deen Hired by Fox News? No, It's Satire.","2013-06-23 16:41:03","  Description: Viral text / Satire Circulating since: June 2013 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: As posted on Facebook, June 23, 2013:
  Fox News Hires Paula Deen for New Cooking Show
  On the heels of being fired by the Food Network, Paula Deen has been handed a brand new gig—with Fox News.
  Desperate to prove that they’re absolutely not racist in any way, and are just being advocates for our First Amendment, Fox News has decided to bring the colorful Paula Deen aboard and will give her a brand new show—Paula Deen: Cooking With A Southern Strategy.
  Analysis: False. This is an example of political satire, not an actual news story, as can easily be verified by reading the final three paragraphs of Allen Clifton's complete article on ForwardProgressives.com, beginning with the statement: 'Of course  none of this is true. I made all of it up.'
  The exact same  dare we call it obvious?  notion occurred to El Guapo at Huffington Post (' Fox News Hires Paula Deen to Host Plantation-Themed Morning Show ') and Sarah Wood at Free Wood Post (' Fox News Nabs Paula Deen After Her Release From Food Network ').
  Apparently lots of people were fooled by the stories, at least initially. Here's a sampling of Facebook comments:
  Annals of fake news: • Mitt Romney: 'Of Course I'll Win, I'm the White Guy' • Obama's 19-Year-Old Son Makes Rare Appearance at DNC • Obama Explains 'Refusal' to Salute the Flag • Ann Coulter Refuses to Board Plane with Black Pilot • Monsanto Cucumbers Cause Genital Baldness • Woman Dies in Premature Rapture

"Top 10 Celebrity Responses to Fake Death Reports","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/celebrities/ss/Celebrity-Responses-To-Fake-Death-Notices.htm","Top 10 Funniest Celebrity Responses to Fake Death Reports","2013-01-29 18:34:23","  The Internet declared Hugh Hefner dead of a heart attack on July 11, 2011. No one was more surprised by the 'news' of his passing than the (then) 85-year-old Playboy magazine founder himself, who responded with a series of tweets confirming he was alive and well, including:
  'I'm happy to see how many people are pleased that I'm not dead. I'm pleased too.'
  R&B singer Usher received the fake news generator treatment on April 10, 2012, inspiring him to tweet a shirtless photo of himself with a caption reading:
  'I must've died and went to heaven... Alive and cold kickin ass!!'
  After a flurry of fake news reports and vandalized Wikipedia entries declared him dead on December 19, 2011, Jon Bon Jovi took to his band's Facebook page and provided the clearest proof possible that the reports were false — a photo of himself holding a hand-lettered sign which read:
  'Heaven looks a lot like New Jersey, Dec. 19th, 2011, 6:00'
  The Twitterverse went crazy on June 25, 2009 after a prankster created a false online report claiming that actor Jeff Goldblum had fallen from a cliff to his death in New Zealand. A few days later, Goldblum went on Comedy Central to pretend-interrupt Stephen Colbert's pretend-coverage of the accident, protesting that he was not, in fact, dead:
  'I'm so sorry to interrupt, my friend Stephen, but look, I'm not dead. In fact, last week I was not even in New Zealand!'
  When Colbert informed Goldblum that New Zealand police had confirmed he was dead, the actor gave in and delivered his own eulogy:
  'No one will miss Jeff Goldblum more than me. He was not only a friend and a mentor, but he was also... me.'
  Actor Morgan Freeman has been a constant target of death hoaxes ever since late 2010, when a bogus retweet of a nonexistent CNN story claimed he had passed away in his Burbank home. The rumor-mongering reached a fever pitch in September 2012 after pranksters launched a Facebook page titled 'RIP Morgan Freeman.' Freeman fought back by posting the following words alongside a photo of himself on his Facebook page:
  'Like Mark Twain, I keep reading that I have died. I hope those stories are not true... But if they are, I'm happy to report that my afterlife seems identical to my life when I was alive. I did go to Las Vegas to begin work on the film 'Last Vegas.' That is anything but a death sentence. -Morgan'
  Two years after Scrubs star Zach Braff was declared dead in a fake CNN article that few people ever saw, someone happened upon it and unleashed the story on Twitter. 'Zach Braff is dead' hysteria reached critical mass on October 12, 2009, prompting the actor to post a rebuttal video on YouTube. Here's an excerpt:
  'I'm alive. I'm here at Scrubs shooting the new Scrubs title sequence which is a little bit like dying, so I guess that was semi-accurate. Also, I would never off myself with pills. If I had to do it, I would do it the way that everyone else would do it—by hitting myself with pots and pans.'
  Poor Bill Cosby. Hardly a month goes by without somebody on the Internet declaring him dead. One such instance occurred on February 5, 2010, prompting the comedian to respond as follows on his personal blog:
  'And now ladies and gentlemen for my rebuttal: As you well know, a dead person cannot rebuttal. Therefore, I am rebuttaling to tell you that when I heard the news I immediately began rebuttaling and went into denial. My wife has just informed me that there is no such word as rebuttaling, she says the word is rebutting. But I don’t care, because I’m alive! Thank you. PS. That’s another thing dead people don’t say.'
  We learned via fake news generator that actor Russell Crowe supposedly died while making a film in Austria on June 10, 2010. Rather than fight it, Crowe took the unusual step of confirming his own death via Twitter :
  'Unable to answer tweets fell off a mountain in Austria, all over red rover. Don't know how i got there, but the media are never wrong. G'Bye.'
  On September 13, 2011 the Twitterverse erupted with rumors — false rumors, naturally — that comedienne Joan Rivers had died. When contacted by Huffington Post for a statement, she replied with characteristic bluntness:
  'I don't know where this came from. I did very well performing this weekend in Ottawa and I didn't even bomb on stage. I think this story came from Betty White — that bitch!'
  On May 4, 2011, like other celebrities before him (see Jeff Goldblum ), professional wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson supposedly died after falling off a cliff in New Zealand. He didn't take kindly to the news. This is what he tweeted that same day:
  'I would love to meet the person who is starting rumors of my death — to show them how a dead foot feels up their ass.'
