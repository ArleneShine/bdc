  Viral message quotes a proposed 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to wit: 'Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and/or Representatives.'
  Description: Viral text / Forwarded email Circulating since: Nov. 2009 Status: Based on erroneous info (details below)
  Example: Email contributed by B. Peterson, Feb. 6, 2010:
  Subject: 28th Amendment!
  For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea that Congress members could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they didn't pay into Social Security, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment ) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered...in all of its forms. Somehow, that doesn't seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law. I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop.
  This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come. Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
  'Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States'.
  Each person contact a minimum of twenty people on their Address list, in turn ask each of those to do likewise. Then in three days, all people in The United States of America will have the Message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.

  Analysis: While the idea of a 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution may indeed be one 'whose time has come,' and there's some historical truth to the claim that Congress has sometimes exempted itself from laws that apply to the rest of us, the argument outlined above is largely based on inaccurate and outdated information.
  Ever since the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act in 1995 Congress has been answerable to the same civil rights and equal employment regulations that pertain to private businesses. Further alleged disparities, such as those having to do with Congressional retirement provisions and health care coverage, are misrepresented above as well. We'll consider the issues one by one.
  It's false that members of Congress can retire after only one term with full pay, and false that they don't pay into Social Security. Members elected after 1983 participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System. Members elected before 1983 participate in the older Civil Service Retirement Program. In both cases, they contribute to the plans at a slightly higher rate than ordinary federal employees. How much members of Congress receive upon retirement depends on their age, length of government service, and the configuration of their plan. All members of Congress pay into Social Security.
  Once upon a time, members of Congress were exempt from many of the employment and civil rights regulations under which private businesses operate, but no longer, thanks to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 . Section 201 includes prohibitions against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as well as sexual and other harassment in the workplace.
  It's false that Congress exempted itself from the provisions of the various health care reform bills introduced in the House and Senate in 2009. According to an analysis by FactCheck.org: 'Members of Congress are subject to the legislation’s mandate to have insurance, and the plans available to them must meet the same minimum benefit standards that other insurance plans will have to meet.'
  (Update: Per a new regulation proposed in August 2013, the federal government would continue to subsidize the premiums of members of Congress and their staffers after they switch to health insurance plans purchased via the ACA exchange.)

"Is It True that ABC News Banned American Flag Lapel Pins?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/abc_flag_pins.htm","Did ABC News Ban Flag Lapel Pins?","2008-11-09 00:00:59","  By David Emery
  A viral message claims ABC News has ordered reporters and news anchors not to wear American flag lapel pins or other patriotic insignia. While there was a request made in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attack, no similar request has been made in subsequent years. However, viral message returns again and again.
  Example #1: Email text, June 25, 2008
  ABC News Bans Flag Lapel Pins
  Yesterday, the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia. Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about 'causes'.
  Since when is support for preventing our death & destruction some sort of a 'cause'? Since when is patriotism to be discouraged. I urge you to boycott ABC and its sponsors and affiliates. And those that advertise with them.
  We’re slowly losing everything our country stands for, and everything our men and women fought and died to preserve.
  Please forward this to as many as you can.

  Subject: ABC NEWS joins OBAMA - Bans American Flag Pins
  ABC News Bans Flag Lapel Pins
  Yesterday, the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia. Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about 'causes'.
  Please note that when the messages above say that ABC News banned flag lapel pins 'yesterday,' they're referring to a date in 2001. This was not a recent event.
  And although it's true that ABC News instituted such a ban shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the network's stated reasons were more cogent than what is indicated above. According to ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider, the network saw it as necessary to protect its reporters' credibility, as well as their personal safety abroad.
  'We cannot signal through outward symbols how we feel, even if the cause is justified,' he said in a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . 'Overseas, it could be perceived that we're just mouthpieces for the U.S. government, and that can place our journalists in danger.'
  ABC was the only major network to set such a policy. It was applauded by some as a sign of integrity and derided by others as an attempt to stifle patriotism. As Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz observed, the issue generated a good deal of ambivalence in the journalistic profession as a whole. 'There are passionate views on both sides of this question,' he said in a September 2001 commentary on CNN. 'Journalists are patriots who love their country, and are horrified by these attacks, but many believe it's simply inappropriate for them to engage in flag-waving on the air.'
  Regardless of which stand they took, every journalist who came down on one side of the issue or the other saw the decision as a matter of conscience. In the aftermath of 9/11, Meet the Press host Tim Russert chose to wear a red, white, and blue ribbon on camera. Other NBC anchors, including Matt Lauer and Katie Couric , did not. At Fox News , Britt Hume and others proudly sported American flag lapel pins. Bill O'Reilly did not.
  'I'm just a regular guy,' O'Reilly was quoted as saying in Time magazine. 'Watch me and you'll know what I think without wearing a pin.'
  The viral messages continue to crop up again and again. They especially recurred during the years of the Obama administration, with reference to the president being seen in messages in 2008 and 2015. However, Obama never banned wearing flag lapel pins by any under his authority. This rumor is bound to recur and be modified to suit the times.

"Altoids, Oral Sex and the Presidency","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/sex/a/altoids.htm","Altoids, Oral Sex and the Presidency","2005-07-16 16:28:28","  By David Emery
  September 14, 1998
  From the Office of the Independent Counsel last week came 445 pages of a peculiarly American form of entertainment: the details of William J. Clinton's sex life. Early reviews made Kenneth Starr's long-awaited tome seem promising.
  'Dirt and filth,' raved Rep. Charles Rangel (Democrat, New York), 'a nickel-and-dime lurid sex story.'
  'There is a pornographic value to this,' enthused Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
  'Resembles a steamy paperback,' declared the Washington Post .
  Unfortunately, the Starr report fails to live up to its notices, offering precious little of what the American people really want from these proceedings, namely hot sex tips from the highest office in the land. One wades through endless volumes of kiss-and-tell testimony to learn little more than that the President's lovemaking philosophy can be summed up in the words, ''Tis better to receive than to give.'
  Starr-crossed lovers
  Most disappointing of all, a portion of the report devoted to White House intern Monica Lewinsky's account of the affair reveals that our Starr-crossed lovers came to the very brink of authenticating a notorious urban legend touting the benefits of a certain 'curiously strong' breath mint during oral sex, then dropped the ball.

  We can't blame Lewinsky, whose testimony proves she was ever ready to take the bit between her teeth. On this occasion it was Clinton who blew it.
  From the Starr report on events allegedly occurring Nov. 13, 1997:
  Fickle priorities
  We cannot but wonder at the President's fickle sense of priorities. No time for oral sex? Further testimony shows that on many other occasions Mr. Clinton was prepared to drop his pants at a moment's notice.
  Nor could he have failed to recognize the import of the experiment Lewinsky was proposing, as detailed in the print-out she handed him.
  Whether it's an impeachable offense I don't know, but Clinton's refusal to put this folk belief to the test when he had a clear and present opportunity to do so compounds the evidence that he does not always have the best interests of the American people at heart. Once again, he has failed to provide the leadership this country needs and wants — a sad commentary on the current state of the presidency, and of the nation.

"Explosive Allegations About Obama's Religion","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/fl/Is-Barack-Obama-a-Muslim.htm","Is Barack Obama a Muslim?","2016-08-16 04:41:09","  By David Emery
  An online rumor circulating since January 2007 alleges that Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim and has lied to the American people about his religious affiliation, including his statement that he's been a devout Christian for most of his adult life. However, the evidence indicates this is false.
  Barack Obama has professed to be a devout Christian and spoken publicly of his 'personal relationship with Jesus Christ,' for more than 20 years. Is he actually a covert Muslim who has lied his entire adult life about his true religious affiliation?
  No tangible proof is offered to that effect— no sightings of Obama attending a mosque, no photos of him reading the Koran, praying to Mecca, or observing Islamic holidays with his family. There is no evidence that Barack Obama has ever evinced a belief in, or commitment to, any other faith than Christianity.
  The entire case, such as it is, rests on a confused and error-ridden recitation of Obama's upbringing and purported childhood influences.
  It also exploits some Americans' fear and deep mistrust of the Muslim faith.
  1)  Obama's father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr., was a 'radical Muslim who migrated from Kenya to Jakarta, Indonesia.' FALSE. Obama, Sr. wasn't a Muslim at all except during early childhood, let alone a 'radical' Muslim. According to Obama, Jr., his father was 'raised a Muslim' but lost his faith and had become a 'confirmed atheist' by the time he attended college. Author Sally Jacobs ( The Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father , New York: Public Affairs Books, 2011) writes that Obama, Sr. was exposed to Muslim teachings as a child but converted to Anglicanism around the age of 6, attended Christian schools into his teens, and was 'a-religious' as an adult. Obama, Jr.'s parents separated not long after he was born; his father moving not to Jakarta but to the United States, where he attended Harvard. Eventually Obama, Sr. returned to Kenya.
  2)  Obama's mother went on to marry another Muslim named Lolo Soetoro who 'educated his stepson as a good Muslim by enrolling him in one of Jakarta's Wahabbi schools.' STATUS: PARTLY TRUE. When Obama's mother remarried, it was indeed to an Indonesian man named Lolo Soetoro, who his stepson later described as a 'non-practicing' Muslim. But it was his secular mother who directly supervised his education, Obama has written, sending him to both Catholic and Muslim primary schools after the family moved to Jakarta. There's nothing on record to indicate Obama attended a madrassa (Muslim religious school) run by Wahhabists. Furthermore it's unlikely his mother would have chosen to expose him to such an extreme form of Islam given her stated abhorrence of religious closed-mindedness and her stated goal of giving her son a well-rounded education, including in matters of faith. Update: CNN tracked down the Indonesian school in question, the Basuki School in Jakarta, which a deputy headmaster describes as a 'public school' with no particular religious agenda. 'In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment,' the headmaster told CNN. A former classmate of Obama's describes the school as 'general,' with students of many religious backgrounds attending. Obama entered the school at the age of 8 and attended for two years.
  3)  'Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim while admitting that he was once a Muslim.' STATUS: FALSE. Once a Muslim? When? Obama has never mentioned, let alone 'admitted' being a Muslim at any point in his life. Yes, he lived in a Muslim country during part of his childhood, but there's no evidence he was literally raised in the Muslim faith, nor has he ever been a practitioner of Islam, so far as any public evidence shows. See also: Is There a Photo of Barack Obama Praying at a Mosque?
  4)   When Obama was sworn into office (as a Senator) he used the Koran instead of the Bible. STATUS: FALSE. According to news accounts, Barack Obama brought his personal Bible to his 2005 Senate swearing-in ceremony, conducted by Vice-President Dick Cheney. Those alleging otherwise are apparently confusing Obama with Congressman Keith Ellison , who actually is a Muslim, and who posed for photographs with his hand on the Koran after being sworn in to the House of Representatives on January 4, 2007.
  Here's sample email text contributed by Bill W. on Jan. 15, 2007:
  Subject: Fwd: Be careful, be very careful. Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to Barack Hussein Obama Sr. (a black Muslim) of Nyangoma-Kogelo, Siaya District, Kenya, and Ann Dunham of Wichita, Kansas (a white atheist). When Obama was two years old, his parents divorced and his father returned to Kenya. His mother married Lolo Soetoro -- a Muslim -- moving to Jakarta with Obama when he was six years old. Within six months he had learned to speak the Indonesian language. Obama spent 'two years in a Muslim school, then two more in a Catholic school' in Jakarta. Obama takes great care to conceal the fact that he is a Muslim while admitting that he was once a Muslim, mitigating that damning information by saying that, for two years, he also attended a Catholic school. Obama's father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr. was a radical Muslim who migrated from Kenya to Jakarta, Indonesia. He met Obama's mother, Ann Dunham - a white atheist from Wichita, Kansas - at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Obama, Sr. and Dunham divorced when Barack, Jr. was two. Obama's spinmeisters are now attempting to make it appear that Obama's introduction to Islam came from his father and that influence was temporary at best. In reality, the senior Obama returned to Kenya immediately following the divorce and never again had any direct influence over his son's education. Dunham married another Muslim, Lolo Soetoro who educated his stepson as a good Muslim by enrolling him in one of Jakarta's Wahabbi schools. Wahabbism is the radical teaching that created the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad on the industrialized world. Since it is politically expedient to be a Christian when you are seeking political office in the United States, Obama joined the United Church of Christ to help purge any notion that he is still a Muslim.

"Amnesty - What Is Amnesty?","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/glossaryterms/g/Amnisty.htm","A Definition of Amnesty","2009-08-26 01:35:41","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Definition: Generally, amnesty is defined as any governmental pardon for past offenses or crimes, especially political ones. Granting amnesty goes beyond a pardon, in that it forgives the said offense completely, and typically without consequences. For purposes of conservative politics, amnesty is a political term typically associated with two major issues -- immigration and capital punishment. As it relates to immigration, amnesty is the term used for granting automatic citizenship to resident aliens, who are in the United States illegally. Amnesty for illegals is the subject of tremendous controversy, since it essentially bypasses the citizenship and assimilation process essential to all legal immigration into the United States. As it relates to the death penalty, amnesty is the term used for when a governor grants a reprieve from execution to a prisoner sentenced to death. In this case, amnesty is different from a pardon in that it doesn't exonerate the condemned from all punitive action or absolve the convicted of all wrongdoing.
  Was the 2013 ' Gang of Eight ' Bill Amnesty?
  The easy answer is: Not really. The 2013  immigration bill did not offer blanket amnesty. In fact, there were a number of requirements, penalties, and steps that needed to be taken in order to remain in the country legally, and not everyone would get to stay:
  The Gang of Eight bill is actually called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. It was a comprehensive immigration reform proposal originating in and passed by the US Senate. It was a Democrat-friendly bill that needed a lot of work and had a lot of poor elements to it. The eight members included Republicans Marco Rubio, John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Michael Bennet. The bill eventually passed by a vote of 68-32. From a conservative standpoint, the bill was not very good and though it had provisions beefing up border security, they were ultimately toothless and gave far too much power to the executive branch.
  Immigration Reform :
  If immigration reform fails once again, it needs to fail after both the Senate and House pass bills. If the House passes an enforcement-first bill that the Senate refuses to adopt, the Senate is equally responsible for reform failing. And while voters agree immigration reform needs to happen, they also agree that closing the border and preventing more illegal immigration is a top priority. If the bill ultimately fails it will be on those grounds. Democrats want little in the way of border security, increasing deportation of criminal aliens, or slowing down the legalization and citizenship process. All of these are crucial elements of any immigration reform. If they are absent, reform should fail. These provisions have broad support among voters. The proof is in the television and radio ads that members of the 'Gang of Eight' are running. In those ads, the Senate bill proponents constantly talk about strong enforcement measures because they know Americans do not want to see the current scenario play out again in a decade. Of course, those measures have been trimmed out of the bill. If immigration reform ultimately fails because conservatives stood for these core elements it will be harder for them to be badgered politically. After all, the are holding out for positions with broad public support. That said, the Republican Party has never been known to play to their advantages well with the public.
  Pronunciation: amnistee
  Also Known As: acquittal, compurgation, exculpation, forgiveness, mercy, release

"The Case for Federalism","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/conservativepolitics101/a/The-Conservative-Case-For-Returning-Government-Power-To-The-States.htm","A Definition of Federalism: The Case for Reinvigorating State's Rights","2012-03-01 18:48:18","  By Marcus Hawkins
  There is an ongoing battle over what the proper size and role of the federal government is, especially as it relates to conflicts with state governments over legislative authority. Conservatives believe that state and local governments should be empowered to handle local issues such as healthcare, education, immigration, and many other social and economic laws. What is federalism, and why do conservatives value a return to a decentralized government?
  There is little question that the current role of the federal government far exceeds anything ever imagined by the founders and has clearly taken over many roles originally designated to individual states. The founding fathers , through the U.S. Constitution , sought to limit the possibility of a strong centralized government and in fact gave the federal government a very limited list of responsibilities. Simplified, the founders thought that the federal government should handle issues that it would be difficult or unreasonable for states to handle such as the maintenance of military and defense operations, negotiating with foreign countries, creating currency, and regulating commerce with foreign countries.
  Ideally, individual states would then handle all most matters that they reasonably could. The founders even went further in the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights to prevent the federal government from grabbing too much power.
  One of the clear benefits of a weaker federal government and stronger state governments is that the needs of each individual state are more easily managed. Alaska, Iowa, Rhode Island, and Florida are all very different states with very different needs, populations, and values. A law that may make sense in New York might make little sense in Alabama. For example: Some states have determined it is necessary to prohibit the use of fireworks due to an environment that is highly susceptible to wild fires. Other states have no such problems and have laws that allow fireworks. It would not be valuable for the federal government to make one standardized law for all states prohibiting fireworks when only a handful of states need such a law in place. State control also empowers states to make tough decisions for their own well-being rather than hope that the federal government will see the states’ problem as a priority.
  A strong state government also empowers citizens in two ways. First, state governments are far more responsive to the needs of the residents of their state. If important issues are not addressed, then voters can hold elections and vote in people they feel are better suited to handle the problems. However, if an issue is only important to one state and the federal government has authority over that issue, then they have little influence to get the change they seek as they are but a small part of a larger electorate. Second, empowered state governments also allow individuals to choose the state that best fit their own personal values. Families and individuals are able to choose states that either have no or low income taxes , or states with higher ones. They can opt for states with weak or strong guns laws, with restrictions on marriage or without them, and so on. Some people may prefer to live in a state that offers a wide range of government programs and services, others may not. But just as the free market allows individuals to pick and choose products or services they like, so to can they choose a state that best fits their lifestyle. An over-reaching federal government limits this option.
  The conflicts between state and federal governments are becoming more common. As the federal government grows larger and begins imposing costly measures on states, states have begun to fight back. While there are many examples of federal-state conflicts, these are a few key current ones.
  With the passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act , the federal government gave itself an incredible amount of power that inflicts burdensome regulations on individuals, corporations, and individual states. The passage of the law prompted 26 states to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn the law, and they argued that there were several thousand new laws that were nearly impossible to implement. The suit has since been accepted for review by the Supreme Court and a ruling is expected before the 2012 Presidential elections. While the federal government claims they have the authority to pass what acts as a doorway to nationalized healthcare, states are fighting back on the issue. Conservative lawmakers argue that states should have the most authority to determine laws regarding healthcare. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney passed a state-wide healthcare law when he was governor of Massachusetts that was not popular with conservatives. However, the bill was popular with the people of Massachusetts. While many states would not wish to implement the law he did, Romney argues that this is why state governments should have the power to implement laws that are right for their states.
  Another major area of contention in the proper roles of government is with illegal immigration. Many border states such as Texas and Arizona have been on the front lines of illegal immigration. While there are currently tough federal laws dealing with illegal immigration, previous and current Republican and Democratic administrations have refused to enforce many of the laws. This has prompted a number of states to pass their own laws that battle the rise of illegal immigration in their own states. One such example is Arizona, which passed SB 1070, and was then sued by the Obama U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over certain provisions in the law. The state argues that their own laws mimic the laws of the federal government that are not being enforced.
  Over the past several election cycles there have been many alleged instances of voting fraud found to have occurred during the voting process. There have been instances of votes being cast in the names of the recently deceased, allegations of double registrations, and absentee voter fraud. In many states you can simply show up to vote with any registered name and be allowed to vote, without proof. A number of states have sought to make it a requirement to show a government issued ID to vote, which has proven both logical and popular idea among voters. One such state is South Carolina , which passed legislation that would have required voters to present an official government-issued photo ID. The law doesn’t seem too unreasonable given that there are laws requiring ID’s for all sorts of things including driving, purchasing alcohol or tobacco, and flying on an airplane. But once again, the DOJ interfered and prevented South Carolina from enacting the law.
  Health Care
  Illegal Immigration
  Voter ID Laws
  It remains highly unlikely that the largess of the federal government will return to the role that was originally intended. Ayn Rand once noted that it took over 100 years for the federal government to get as large as it has, and reversing the trend would also take as long a time. However, conservatives must argue the necessity of reducing the size and scope of the federal government and restoring power back to the states. Obviously, the first goal of conservatives is to continue to elect candidates that have the power to stop the trend of an ever-increasing federal government. The 2010 election cycle was a start, but many more strong state-rights advocates are needed to effect real change. Additionally, there is a new movement that would give states the ability to over-ride federal laws if a certain majority signed on. Senator Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming) offered a constitutional amendment that would do just that. This would also provide a fair check-and-balance with a federal government that often claims authority where it constitutionally should have none.

"How We Know for Sure That Barack Obama Is Not the Antichrist","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/obamaantichrist.htm","Is Barack Obama the Antichrist?","2008-03-21 20:55:14","  Viral message claims charismatic U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama is the Antichrist prophesied in the New Testament of the Bible.
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: March 2008 Status: Silly (see details below)
  Example #1: Email contributed by C. Green, March 13, 2008:
  Example #2: Email contributed by Bob H., June 19, 2008:
  Analysis: Barack Obama, the Antichrist? This would have to count as the ultimate political smear. I mean, accusing a politician of accepting bribes or cheating on taxes is one thing. Calling him the 'Seven-Headed Beast of Revelation' (a.k.a. 'the Wicked One,' 'False Prophet,' and 'Beast from the Abyss') is candidate bashing on an apocalyptic scale.
  Though it is unclear what, besides being charismatic and popular, Barack Obama has done to earn this dishonor, outgoing Antichrist designee George W. Bush must be thrilled to see a newcomer wearing the ungodly mantle. Obama joins an extensive roster of modern luminaries branded with a '666,' including Adolf Hitler , Vladimir Putin , Pope Benedict XVI , Bill Gates , and Barney the Dinosaur .
  For the record, while Barack Obama is indeed in his forties and by most accounts a persuasive speaker, he is not a Muslim (nor, for that matter, does the Book of Revelation say the Antichrist is a Muslim), nor has he ever delivered a stump speech promising 'world peace.'
  Definition
  The American Heritage Dictionary defines 'Antichrist' as 'the great antagonist who was expected by the early Church to set himself up against Christ in the last days before the Second Coming.'
  While biblical in origin, the exact details as to the nature, identity, and chronological placement of the figure known as 'Antichrist' have been the subject of endless speculation throughout history, partly due to the highly symbolic language of the scriptures in which it is mentioned, and partly due to sectarian differences in interpretation. Generally speaking, those who expect the Antichrist to literally appear in human form believe he will come to power as a world leader through deception and trickery, and 'by peace shall destroy many,' only to succumb to the superior might of Jesus Christ and the forces of righteousness at the final battle of Armageddon.
  Who is it?
  Who is the Antichrist? Take your pick. In addition to the personages mentioned above, nominees over the past two thousand years have included the Roman emperor Nero, any or all Popes of the Catholic Church , Peter the Great, Napoleon, Friedrich Nietzsche (self-anointed), John F. Kennedy (who allegedly received 666 votes during the 1956 Democratic convention), Mikhail Gorbachev , and William Jefferson Clinton. And on and on the list goes.
  Some say the Antichrist will be a Jew. Others say he'll be a Muslim. Others say a Catholic. Some say he will emerge in Russia, others the Middle East , and still others say he will be a leader of the European Union .
  The point to take away is that it's all speculation, and fanciful speculation at that. The Biblical passages mentioning the Antichrist are so obscure and fraught with mythic imagery that they require interpretation.
  And much of the interpretation they've been subjected to, unfortunately, is based on extra-Biblical assumptions, not to mention pseudo-scientific borrowings from astrology and numerology.
  Let's not mince words: it's bunk.
  In two millennia of playing 'Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Antichrist' (as author Jonathan Kirsch characterizes it in A History of the End of the World ), no one has ever won the prize.
  Either the game is rigged, or those playing it don't have a clue.
  Politics as unusual
  If it wasn't intended as a political smear  and we have no way of knowing, admittedly, what the true motivation of its author was  we are entitled at the very least to conclude that this whisper campaign identifying Obama with the Antichrist is based in ignorance and fear. Ignorance, because the author knows next to nothing about the Biblical underpinnings of his or her claims (including the proper title of the Book of Revelation). Fear, because the author willingly foregoes reason for superstitious terror.
  Obama, the man, is neither Christlike nor Satanic. He is an ordinary politician who happens to have a sonorous voice and the gift of gab.
  He also has a platform. What say we judge him based on his merits?
  Note on Ken Blackwell: The quoted passage has also been tacked onto the end of an anti-Obama op-ed piece written by conservative newspaper columnist Ken Blackwell, making it appear as if he wrote it. He did not. There was no mention of the Antichrist in the original column.
  Poll: Has your opinion of Obama been affected at all by Internet rumors? 1) Yes, a lot . 2) Yes, a little . 3) No, not at all .

"What Happened to Barack Obama's Birth Certificate?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/obama_birth_certificate.htm","Barack Obama's Birth Certificate","2009-07-29 20:58:54","  An examination of rumors alleging that Barack Obama's birth certificate is either a forgery or an invalid 'short-form' computer print-out which fails to establish his status as a U.S. citizen.
  Update: On April 27, 2011, the White House released a certified copy of Obama's original ('long-form') birth record.
  THE SAGA OF Barack Obama's birth certificate is tortuous and ironic. It began with the June 2008 release of a scanned image of candidate Obama's state-issued Certification of Live Birth to quell rumors speculating that his religious affiliation and/or country of origin might be other than what he claimed.
  Partisan scuttlebutt had it that Obama's middle name was really 'Mohammed,' for example — which, if true, would lend support to rumblings that he had grown up a Muslim — and that he was actually born in Kenya, not the United States — which of course would mean he's not a natural-born citizen and therefore ineligible for the presidency.
  The scanned Certification of Live Birth refuted both of those claims, yet somehow only managed to ignite further controversy. Validity assailed First, it was labeled a forgery. Anonymous Internet 'experts' claimed they were able to detect anomalies in the image that proved it couldn't possibly be authentic. When that failed to fly, the document was assailed for being a 'short-form' computer print-out as opposed to an original, hospital-issued 'long-form' birth record. A cry went up for the release of Obama's 'real' birth certificate, which conspiracy theorists now claimed was being 'suppressed' (or 'sealed') by the state of Hawaii because of potentially explosive information it might contain. Six months into his presidency and fully a year after the Certification of Live Birth was first posted online, a small but increasingly vocal minority was still demanding to know why President Obama 'refuses' to show his birth certificate.
  The appropriate response is that he has already done so. The document released in 2008 is a valid Hawaii birth record, vetted by multiple sources including state officials, and constitutes legally sufficient proof that Barack Hussein Obama was born on U.S. soil on August 4, 1961. Let's examine some of the arguments to the contrary: CLAIM: The scanned Certification of Live Birth released by Obama is a forgery. EXAMPLE:
  STATUS: FALSE. 'It's a valid Hawaii state birth certificate,' stated Hawaii Department of Health spokesperson Janice Okubo when queried by the St. Petersburg Times ' PolitiFact.com website in June 2008. In addition, the actual physical document was scrutinized and photographed by researchers at FactCheck.org (see hi-res images ), who determined that it was in fact duly signed, sealed, and certified by the Hawaii state registrar, and 'meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship.' Sources: • Obama's Birth Certificate: Final Chapter. Politifact.com, July 2009 • Born in the U.S.A. FactCheck.org, 1 Nov 2008 CLAIM: As distinguished from a 'long-form' Certificate of Live Birth, the 'short-form' Certification of Live Birth issued by Hawaii and posted online by the Obama campaign isn't a 'real' or 'valid' birth certificate. EXAMPLE:
  STATUS: FALSE. According to both the Hawaii state government website and a June 6, 2009 article in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin , the computer-generated Certification of Live Birth is the only kind of birth record now issued by the state (original records are stored electronically), so the distinction between 'short-form' and 'long-form' is moot. When a citizen of Hawaii requests a certified copy of his or her birth certificate from the state, a Certification of Live Birth — what people are calling the 'short-form,' and what Obama released to the public — is what they get. According to Hawaii Health Department spokesperson Janice Okubo, a COLB contains 'all the information needed by all federal government agencies for transactions requiring a birth certificate.' Sources: • Born Identity. Honolulu Star-Bulletin , 6 June 2009 • HI Officials Confirm Obama's Original Birth Certificate Still Exists. Honolulu Advertiser , 28 July 2009
  CLAIM: Since Hawaii law allows residents to obtain birth certificates for children born outside the state, the released document still doesn't prove that Obama couldn't have been born in, say, Kenya. EXAMPLE:
  Birth announcements published in the Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star-Bulletin in August 1961 confirm that Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. Sources: • 'Birther' Movement Dogs Republicans.

"Understanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/economy/a/fannie_mae.htm","What Is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?","2008-09-10 08:14:41","  By Kathy Gill
  The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) were chartered by Congress to create a secondary market for residential mortgage loans. They are considered 'government-sponsored' because Congress authorized their creation and established their public purposes. Together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are largest source of housing finance in the United States. Here's how it works:
  The theory is that by providing this service, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attract investors who might not otherwise invest funds in the mortgage market. This, theoretically, increases the pool of money available to potential homeowners. Third quarter 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held mortgages valued at $4.7 billion -- about the size of the total publicly-held debt of the U.S. Treasury .
  By July 2008, their portfolio was called a $5 trillion mess . History of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were Congressionally-chartered, they are also private, shareholder-owned corporations. They have been regulated by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development since 1968 and 1989, respectively. However, Fannie Mae is more than 40 years old. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal created Fannie Mae in 1938 to help jump start the national housing market after the Great Depression. And Freddie Mac was born in 1970. In 2007, EconoBrowser noted that today there is 'no explicit government guarantee of their debt.' In September 2008, the US government seized both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other GSEs
  Contemporary Congressional Action Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac In 2007, the House passed H.R. 1427, a GSE regulatory reform package. Then-Comptroller General David Walker stated in Senate testimony that “[A] single housing GSE regulator could be more independent, objective, efficient and effective than separate regulatory bodies and could be more prominent than either one alone. We believe that valuable synergies could be achieved and expertise in evaluating GSE risk management could be shared more easily within one agency.” Sources:

"Did Obama Really Say He Wants to Replace the National Anthem?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/obama_anthem.htm","Obama Explains 'Refusal' to Salute Flag in Viral Hoax","2008-04-18 17:29:54","  Circulating via social media and forwarded email, statements purportedly made by Barack Obama on Meet the Press explain why he 'refuses' to wear a flag pin on his lapel or salute the flag during the U.S. pledge of allegiance and playing of the national anthem. None of the statements were actually made by him.
  Description: Viral text / Hoax Circulating since: March 2008 Status: False / All quotes are fabricated (details below)
  Example #1 Email contributed by an AOL user, March 27, 2008:
  Example #2 Email contributed by Sue F., March 18, 2010:
  Analysis: No, presidential candidate Barack Obama didn't actually utter those asinine words. All of the quotes attributed to him above are fictitious.
  Some of them, specifically the sentences quoted first in the earlier variant above — e.g., 'I like the song 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it' — were put in Obama's mouth by conservative humorist John Semmens (see his October 27, 2007 column, ' Semi-News , on the Arizona Conservative website).
  His intent was satirical.
  Semmens's barbs were aimed at two of candidate Obama's actions early on in the presidential campaign that were perceived by some as insufficiently patriotic: 1) his decision to stop wearing a U.S. flag pin, and 2) his failure to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of the national anthem at a public event in 2007.
  Of the first (not wearing a flag pin), Obama's actual explanation went as follows:
  'You know, the truth is that right after 9/11, I had a pin. Shortly after 9/11, particularly because as we're talking about the Iraq War , that became a substitute for I think true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security , I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest. Instead, I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great, and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism.' ( Source: ABC News, Oct. 4, 2007 .)
  Obama took to wearing a flag lapel pin during public appearances after becoming President.
  As to the second item (failure to salute during the national anthem), the implication that Obama has taken an ideological stand against saluting the flag is misleading and unsupported by evidence.
  On one occasion in 2008 he was caught on film singing along during the national anthem with hands clasped in front of him instead of his right hand over his heart, prompting a partisan outcry.
  'In no way was he making any sort of statement,' responded an Obama aide when questioned by the press, 'and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous.' (Source: Inside Edition , October 23, 2007.)
  On literally scores of other occasions before and since, Obama has been photographed with hand over heart in appropriate situations.
  As if to demonstrate that smear-mongering is a team sport, additional fabrications have been appended to the message since its inbox-to-inbox journey commenced in March 2008.
  None of the quotes attributed to Obama are authentic; nor is the claim that Obama uttered them during an alleged September 7, 2008 appearance on Meet the Press ( which didn't take place ); nor is the attribution of the article as a whole to a Washington Post reporter named Dale Lindsborg ( who doesn't exist ).
  Caveat lector.

"When Bundling Political Contributions Is Legal and Illegal","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/Money-In-Politics/fl/What-Is-Bundling-In-Politics.htm","When Bundling Political Contributions Is Legal and Illegal","2013-12-28 21:24:00","  By Tom Murse
  Bundling political contributions is a common practice in congressional and presidential campaigns. Bundling is a form of political fundraising in which one person or a small group of people convince their friends, coworkers and other like-minded donors to write checks to a candidate for public office.
  Related: How to Start Your Own Super PAC
  The term bundler is used to describe the person or small group of people, often times lobbyists , who pool or aggregate these contributions and then deliver them in one lump sum to a political campaign. In the 2000 presidential campaign, Republican George W. Bush used the term 'pioneers' to describe bundlers who raised at least $100,000 for his White House bid.
  Bundlers are often rewarded by successful candidates with plum positions in an administration or other political favors. Four out of five of President Barack Obama's largest fundraisers in the 2008 campaign received key posts in his administration, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics.
  Bundling is a legal albeit regulated way for a campaign supporter to get around individual contribution limits set forth in federal campaign finance laws . An individual can contribute up to $2,700 to a candidate for federal office in a single election cycle, or up to $5,400 a year.
  But a bundler can persuade like-minded donors to give at once, whether by inviting them to a fundraiser or special event, and turn over massive sums of money to federal candidates.
  The Federal Election Commission requires that candidates for federal office disclosure the funds bundled by registered lobbyists. The threshold for reporting a bundled contribution is $17,600, according to the FEC.
  Related : What is Dark Money?
  Sometimes candidates voluntarily disclose the names of large bundlers. In the 2008 presidential election , for example, Democratic nominee Barack Obama and Republican nominee John McCain both agreed to make public the names of bundlers who raised more than $50,000.
  Related : Wealthiest Presidential Candidates
  The FEC rules, however, are considered loose by government watchdogs and easily circumvented by crafty bundlers and lobbyists wishing to remain out of the public eye. In some cases, bundlers are able to avoid disclosing their role in raising large sums of money for a campaign by never physically pooling and delivering the checks, just organizing the fundraising.
  How Much Money Are We Talking?
  Bundlers are responsible for generating tens of millions of dollars to their preferred candidates. In the 2012 presidential race , for example, bundlers delivered about $200 million to Obama's campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
  Related : How Much Did the 2012 Presidential Race Cost?
  'Bundlers, who are often corporate CEOs, lobbyists, hedge fund managers or independently wealthy people, are able to funnel far more money to campaigns than they could personally give under campaign finance laws,' reports the good-government group Public Citizen.
  According to Public Citizen, bundlers who deliver large amounts of campaign cash to candidates have been rewarded with access to prominent advisers and strategists, official titles and privileged treatment in campaigns, and ambassadorships and other plum political appointments.
  The Center for Public Integrity reported that Obama rewarded about 200 bundlers with jobs and appointments.
  Related : How to Search for Campaign Contributions Online
  'Bundlers play an enormous role in determining the success of political campaigns and are apt to receive preferential treatment if their candidate wins,' Public Citizen wrote. 'Bundlers who direct money to presidential candidates tend to be first in line for plum ambassador positions and other political appointments. Industry titans and lobbyists are more likely to receive preferential treatment from elected officials if they raised large amounts of money for them.'
  Bundlers seeking political favors often promise big money to candidates. And sometimes they fail to deliver. So in some cases, bundlers have been known to give large sums of money to employees, family members and friends with the implicit goal of having those employees, family members and friends turn around and contribute to a candidate for Congress or the presidency.
  That's illegal.

  From: Subject: FW: think about this
  Coincidence ?
  Hmmmmmmmmm......
  You are aware, probably, that Barack Obama lost his bearings recently and said that he was going to campaign in all 57 states. You heard this? And everybody chalked it up to, 'Well, he's tired.'
  Barack Obama says he's gonna go out and campaign in 57 states, he was just tired, you know, it's been such a long campaign, he's been so many places, he probably thinks there are 57 states. Well, I have here a printout from a website called the International Humanist and Ethical Union. And here is how the second paragraph of an article on that website begins. 'Every year from 1999 to 2005 the organization of the Islamic conference representing the 57 Islamic states presented a resolution to the United Nations commission on human rights called combating.' And the title of the piece here is, 'How the Islamic states dominate the UN human rights council,' and there are 57 of them.
  Obama said he's going to campaign in 57 states, and it turns out that there are 57 Islamic states. There are 57 Islamic states. ; ; So did Obama just lose his bearings, or was this a more telling slip, ladies and gentlemen?
  DO ALL AMERICANS A FAVOR AND FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR EMAIL LIST..... With our country at odds with the Muslems, what will happen if Obama is one? Think and pray before voting!

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: It's true that during a May 9, 2008 campaign stop in Oregon, Barack Obama said he had visited 57 states. The exact quote, as transcribed in the LA Times 'Top of the Ticket' blog (and viewable on YouTube ), went as follows:
  The rest of this forwarded email can be taken as either a joke or a smear, depending on how amusing one finds yet another reference to Obama's rumored secret adherence to the Muslim faith.
  Is it true there are exactly 57 Islamic states in the world? That depends on how you're counting. There are, as of this writing, exactly 57 member states in the above-mentioned Organization of the Islamic Conference, which roughly coincides with the number of countries currently boasting a Muslim majority population (estimates range from 55 to 57). But if the criterion for 'Islamic state' is full-blown Muslim rule, the number is significantly smaller than 57.
  Finally, is Barack Obama a covert Muslim? If you have to ask, you haven't been paying attention .

"What Was the 'Mississippi Burning' Case?","http://crime.about.com/od/history/p/ms_burn.htm","The 'Mississippi Burning' Case","2005-06-15 10:14:52","  By Charles Montaldo
  A civil rights movement in 1964, named Freedom Summer, was a campaign launched to get African Americans in the southern United States registered to vote. Thousands of students and civil rights activists, both white and black, joined the organization, Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) and traveled to southern states to register voters. In was in this atmosphere that three civil rights workers were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan .
  Michael Schwerner, a 24-year old from Brooklyn, New York, and 21-year old James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi, were working in and around Neshoba County, Mississippi, to register blacks to vote, opening 'Freedom Schools' and organizing black boycotts of white-owned businesses in Meridan.
  The Ku Klux Klan was very active in Mississippi during the 1960s and many of the members included local businessmen, law enforcement, and prominent men in the communities.
  Sam Bowers was the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights during 'Freedom Summer' and had an intense dislike for Schwerner. In May 1964, the Laurderdale and Neshoba KKK members received word from Bowers that Plan 4 was activated. Plan 4 was to get rid of Schwerner.
  The Klan learned that Schwerner had a meeting scheduled on the evening of June 16 with members at Mount Zion Church in Longdale, Mississippi. The church was to be a future location for one of the many Freedom Schools that were opening throughout Mississippi. Members of the church held a business meeting that evening and as the 10 were leaving the church around 10 p.m. that night they met face to face with more than 30 klansmen lined up with shotguns.
  The Klan was misinformed however, because Schwerner was actually in Oxford, Ohio. Frustrated at not finding the activist, the Klan began to beat the church members and burned the wood-framed church to the ground. Schwerner learned of the fire and he, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman, who were all attending a three-day CORE seminar in Oxford, decided to return to Longdale to investigate the Mount Zion Church incident. On June 20, the three, in a blue CORE-owned Ford station wagon, headed south.
  Schwerner was very aware of the danger of being a civil rights worker in Mississippi, especially in Neshoba County, which had the reputation as being particularly unsafe. After stopping overnight in Merridan, MS, the group headed straight for Neshoba Country to inspect the burned out church and meet with some of the members who had been beaten. During the visits they learned the real target of the KKK was Schwerner, and they were warned that some local white men were trying to find him.
  At 3 p.m. the three in the highly visible blue Core-wagon, set off to return to Meridan, Ms. Stationed at the Core office in Merridan was Core worker, Sue Brown, who was told by Schwerner if the three weren't back by 4:30 p.m., then they were in trouble. Deciding that Highway 16 was a safer route, the three turned onto it, headed west, through Philadelphia, Ms, back to Meridan. A few miles outside of Philadelphia, Klan member, Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price, spotted the CORE wagon on the highway.
  Not only did Price spot the car, but he also recognized the driver, James Chaney. The Klan hated Chaney, who was a black activist and a born Mississippian. Price pulled the wagon over and arrested and jailed the three students for being under suspicion of arson in the Mount Zion Church fire.
  After the three failed to return to Meridan on time, CORE workers placed calls to the Neshoba County jail asking if the police had any information about the three civil rights workers. Jailer Minnie Herring, denied any knowledge about their whereabouts. All of the events that took place after the three were imprisoned is uncertain but one thing is known for sure, they were never seen alive again. The date was June 21, 1964.
  By June 23, FBI agent John Proctor and a team of 10 agents, were in Neshoba Country investigating the disappearance of the three men. What the KKK had not counted on was the national attention that the three civil rights workers disappearance would ignite. Then President, Lyndon B. Johnson put the pressure on J. Edgar Hoover to get the case solved. The first FBI office in Mississippi was opened and the military bused sailors into Neshoba County to help search for the missing men.
  The case became known as MIBURN, for Mississippi Burning, and top FBI Inspectors were sent to help with the investigation.

  Now is it just me, are both of them as dumb as they appear. I guess this could have been taken in a mirror which would screw it up, or maybe it is authentic. I would not doubt it being authentic!!!! Note both have rings on their ring finger and most likely on their left hand. I think they are truly clueless!!!!

  DING BAT AND DUMBO I can't believe these two! Amazing!
  YOUR RIGHT HANDS DUMBO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mr And Mrs. Clueless! What's wrong with this picture?
  Gotta be the dumbest fools to ever hold the office of President, anywhere.
  How embarrassing to have this as our President and first lady? When you've never done the pledge allegiance, you don't know what to do!
  Must be the Muslim way.
  At first I thought the picture was reversed, but the wedding rings indicate that it’s right. (Unless they have them on the wrong hands too.)
  (THE LAPEL PIN IS ALSO A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION.) It's in our hands, November 2010 & 2012!
  Analysis: The picture above is a doctored mirror image of a press photo taken during a ceremony commemorating the victims of 9/11 on the South Lawn of the White House, September 11, 2009. The original is credited to AP photographer Charles Dharapak.
  The doctored version boasts Photoshopped wedding bands and reversed jacket buttons to make it appear as though the image hasn't been tinkered with.
  The ruse is spoiled by the medals on the uniform of the Marine standing in soft focus behind the President, however. They're on the wrong side of his chest.
  Nor was Mr. Dharapak the only photographer present at the occasion. Other images of the same ceremony clearly show the President and Mrs. Obama standing with their right hands over their hearts during the playing of Taps .

  Analysis: It appears one of the things Americans will have to put up with until the bigots among us get over the fact that we have an African-American President is the dissemination of racist jokes at Barack Obama's expense.
  For all the talk of the nation having entered a 'post-racial' phase as of the landmark 2008 election, it's crystal clear that racial antagonisms still exist, and won't go away overnight.
  Around the same time the above image began circulating (late February 2009), another example of blatant prejudice surfaced in the form of an Obama-themed book display in a Florida Barnes & Noble store containing a volume entitled Monkeys (for which the company apologized, saying it was a case of customer vandalism).
  It is not the case, needless to say, that either of the two customized Boeing 747 aircraft officially designated Air Force One when used by the President bears the tail number 'NI66ER' (call letters N-I-SIX-SIX-E-R). The actual tail numbers are 28000 and 29000.

"Here's When Donald Trump Will Be Inaugurated President","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/presidenc1/tp/Presidential-Inauguration-Day-2017.htm","Inauguration Day 2017","2015-01-30 01:36:11","  By Tom Murse
  Inauguration Day 2017, the day Donald Trump will assume the role of chief executive of the United States, is Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. The nation's 45th president will be sworn in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, when the term of President Barack Obama expires.
  Related : Read About Barack Obama's 2013 Swearing In Ceremony
  So how will Inauguration Day 2017 work?
  Why is Inauguration Day always held on Jan. 20 at noon?
  Related : Who's Running for President in 2016?
  Here are six things you need to know about the important day.
  That's right: President Barack Obama will technically be president of the United States right up until noon on Jan. 20, 2017, under provisions sets forth in the U.S. Constitution 's 20th Amendment.
  Related Story: Date of the 2016 Presidential Election
  He will be serving the final hours of his second term and completing a historic presidency as the nation's first African-American to serve in the White House. According to the amendment: 'The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January .' More »
  Inauguration Day is replete with pomp and pageantry, including the traditional inaugural ball . These events have been held every four years since May 7, 1789, when the first inaugural ball was put on in honor of President George Washington. Modern-day inaugural balls cost tens of millions of dollars to put on, and there are usually way more than just one held the night of the new president's inauguration. More »
  Obama, a Democrat, will greet and likely dine with president-elect Donald Trump even if he's from a different political party. It's become tradition for American presidents to allow for the peaceful transition of power from one United States president and his administration to another. More »
  We try to shy away from making predictions about Election Day here, but this trend is difficult to ignore: Americans are fairly reluctant to elect consecutive presidents from the same political party. So if history is any indication, voters are likely to side with a Republican in 2016 after eight years under a Democratic president.
  The last time voters elected a Democrat to the White House after a president from the same party had just served a full term was in 1856, before the Civil War. That president was James Buchanan , the 15th president and the only one ever to come from Pennsylvania. Buchanan succeeded President Franklin Pierce . More »
  The incoming president will take the oath of office , which consists of the following statement: 'I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' More »
  Every president is expected to deliver an inaugural address, a speech whose purpose is to reunite an electorate that is still healing and divided from the election two months earlier, a speech that sets the course in policy and direction for the administration over the ensuing four years while acknowledging the work of the previous president.
  'Civility,' President George W. Bush said in his 2001 inaugural address, 'is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.' More »

"Voting Rights Act of 1965","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/supremecourt/a/The-Voting-Rights-Act.htm","Voting Rights Act of 1965","2013-06-27 01:05:14","  By Tom Murse
  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a key component of the civil rights movement that seeks to enforce the Constitution 's guarantee of every American's right to vote under the 15th Amendment . The Voting Rights Act was was designed to end discrimination against black Americans, particularly those in the South after the Civil War.
  A important provision of the Voting Rights Act reads:
  The provision reflected the 15th Amendment of the Constitution, which reads:
  President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law on August 6, 1965.
  The law made it illegal for Congress and state governments to pass voting laws based on race and has been described as the most effective civil rights law ever enacted. Among other provisions, the act prohibited discrimination through the use of poll taxes and the application of literacy tests to determine whether voters could take part in elections.
  'It is widely regarded as enabling the enfranchisement of millions of minority voters and diversifying the electorate and legislative bodies at all levels of American government,' according to The Leadership Conference, which advocates for civil rights.
  The U.S. Supreme Court has issued several major rulings on the Voting Rights Act.
  The first was in 1966. The court initially upheld the constitutionality of the law.
  In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required nine states to get federal approval from the Department of Justice or a federal court in Washington, D.C., before making any changes to their election laws. That preclearance provision was originally set to expire in 1970 but was extended numerous times by Congress.
  The decision was 5-4. Voting to invalidate that provision in the act were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Voting in favor of keeping the law intact were Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen G. Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan .
  Roberts, writing for the majority, said that portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was outdated and that 'the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterizes voting in the covered jurisdictions.'
  In the 2013 decision, Roberts cited data that showed turnout among black voters had grown to exceed that of white voters in most of the states originally covered by the Voting Rights Act. His comments suggest that discrimination against blacks had diminished greatly since the 1950s and 1960s.
  The provision struck down by the 2013 ruling covered nine states, most of them in the South. Those states are:
  The Supreme Court's 2013 ruling was decried by critics who said it gutted the law. President Barack Obama was sharply critical of the decision.
  The ruling was praised, however, in states that had been overseen by the federal government. In South Caroline, Attorney General Alan Wilson described the law as an 'extraordinary intrusion into state sovereignty in certain states.
  Congress was expected to take up revisions of the invalidated section of the law in the summer of 2013.

"VA Makes Veterans Burial Locations Available Online","http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/veterans/a/vetburialonline.htm","Veterans Burial Locations Available Online","2004-04-17 12:50:39","  By Robert Longley
  More than three million records showing where veterans have been buried in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national cemeteries are available online. The innovation will make it easy for anyone with Internet access to search for the gravesite locations of deceased family members and friends.
  The VA's nationwide grave locator contains more than three million records of veterans and dependents buried in the VA’s 120 cemeteries since the Civil War . It also has records of some burials in state veterans' cemeteries and burials in Arlington National Cemetery from 1999 to the present.
  'This advance in service culminates years of effort by VA’s national cemetery staffs to put old paper records into this database,' said Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi in a VA press release. 'Making burial locations more accessible may bring more visitors to the honored resting places that we consider national shrines and historical treasures.'
  [ Not All Returning Veterans Suffer, Study Shows ]
  The records date to the establishment of the first national cemeteries during the Civil War. The Web site will be updated nightly with information on burials the previous day.
  The site displays the same information that visitors to national cemeteries find on kiosks or in written ledgers to locate gravesites: name, dates of birth and death, period of military service, branch of service and rank if known, the cemetery’s location and phone number, plus the grave’s precise location in the cemetery.
  The home page, 'Burial and Memorial Benefits,' allows the reader to select the Nationwide Gravesite Locator to begin a search.
  [ Rate of Unemployed Veterans Still Falling ]
  State cemetery burial records are from those cemeteries that use VA’s database to order government headstones and markers for veterans’ graves. Since 1999, Arlington National Cemetery, operated by the Department of Army, has used that database.
  The information in the database comes from records of interment, which before 1994 were paper records, kept at each cemetery. VA’s interment records contain more information than what is shown on the Internet and cemetery kiosks. Some information, such as identification of the next of kin, will not be shown to the public for privacy reasons. Immediate family members with a government-issued identification card may request to see the full record of a burial when they visit a national cemetery.

"The Dangers of Illegal Immigration: One Week of Headlines","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/illegal-immigration/fl/The-Dark-Side-of-Open-Borders-and-Illegal-Immigration.htm","The Dark Side of Open Borders and Illegal Immigration","2014-07-17 11:57:19","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Establishment Republicans have become so worried about losing Hispanic votes that they are afraid to confront the illegal immigration epidemic head-on. Yes, the media and the left will drop the 'racist' charge on anyone who favors enforcing the US-Mexican border to prevent thousands upon thousands of people from crossing the border illegally. We get inundated with tear-jerker exposes on the so-called 'dreamers.' These are the illegal immigrants who are portrayed as having been brought across the border at a young age and grew up as Americans and want nothing more than to be good Americans.
  The way the debate has been framed by the leftist media for years has made the GOP afraid to tackle the subject. The line between illegal and legal immigration has been blurred, if not completely eliminated. Tired lines about how 'the nation was built on immigration' are deployed time and again. This understandably left the fully non-persuasive and inept Republicans to jump on the pander-mobile as their desire to hold onto power meant left them abandoning doing what is right.
  The country is now paying the price.
  And while those tug-at-your-heart stories are beloved media features that have undoubtedly shifted the polls towards legalization over the years, the reality of the problems illegal immigration causes can no longer be ignored. Shouldn't we know who is and who is not in the country legally? Here is just one week of illegal immigration stories:
  La Grulla, Texas - A member of the 'hyper-violent gang' MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha) and several other illegal immigrants, possibly recruits, were found during a traffic stop. Apparently this was the third time the gang-member had been caught illegally on US soil and deported. MS-13 is considered one of the most violent gangs and has been recruiting teenagers, in competition with the drug cartels, who are crossing the border.
  Mesa, Arizona - After a police officer was killed in a head-on collision with an illegal immigrant with a .24% blood alcohol content - he was driving the wrong way on the freeway - the officer's mother penned a letter to President Obama. She noted that the man who killed her son 'was in this country illegally, convicted of previous crimes, no Social Security number, no valid driver's license BUT he had purchased a vehicle and registered it to drive in Maricopa County Arizona.'
  Parker County, Texas - A four-time deportee was arrested for allegedly breaking into a neighbors home and molesting a young girl. After being caught and deported in 2003, 2004, 2009, and 2010, his family members say that he re-entered the country roughly 30 days before the incident for a 5th time, riding in on the wave of 'undocumented children.'
  Washington, D.C. - As the crisis continued to unfold, Congressional Democrats went further and announced that we cannot build a wall and that America's 'doors are open,' that taxpayers were on the hook for the 'health, safety, and educational needs' of these illegal immigrants and that they were entitled to taxpayer-funded legal representation.
  Lubbock, Texas - An illegal alien who was set free just last month as part of the Obama administration's catch-and-release policies was arrested for allegedly bludgeoning his girlfriend to death.
  Mission, Texas - Another tragic side effect of elements within the US encouraging illegal alien crossings is the number of casualties. A report noted that many attempts to cross the Rio Grande have failed as illegal immigrants 'don’t make it across the river; multiple sources became emotional when recounting their discoveries of small, lifeless bodies washed up along the riverbank.' A Guatemalan teenager recently died in the Texas desert.
  El Paso, Texas - The pro-illegal crowd has tried to argue that those crossing the border are doing so to escape violence in Central America and should be considered refugees. But a government report , with DEA and Homeland Security input, found that over 95% of those illegals surveyed on why they crossed revealed that it was believed that unaccompanied minors and non-Mexican women would be given passes, not because they were escaping violence.
  According to Gallup, illegal immigration is now the 'most important problem' facing the United States today. The problem barely registered in a tie for 10th place at the beginning of 2014. The problems with illegal immigration go beyond just those listed here. This is but a snapshot of a week of stories. The short and long-term costs associated with illegal immigration are worrisome. Obama sought nearly $4 billion dollars to 'handle' the crisis that his administration effectively created by contracting out escort services for those crossing the border. The high costs for housing and educating, as well as taking care of the health needs is also a major problem, especially for a government that is still running yearly deficits in excess of $550 billion.

  Venezuela Dictator Hugo Chavez has vowed to bring down the U.S. government. Chavez, president of Venezuela, told a TV audience : 'Enough of imperialist aggression; we must tell the world: down with the U.S. empire. We have to bury imperialism this century.'
  The guest on his television program, beamed across Venezuela, was Cindy Sheehan, the antiwar activist. Chavez recently had as his guest Harry Belafonte, who called President Bush 'the greatest terrorist in the world.'

  Take Action
  Please decide that you will not be shopping at a Citgo station. Why should U.S. citizens who love freedom be financing a dicator who has vowed to take down our government?
  Very important. Please forward this to your friends and family. Most of them don't know that Citgo is owned by the Venezuela government.
  Update: Variants of this message circulating since November 2006 claim that some Citgo stations have changed their name to Petro Express in order to avoid being boycotted. One message states that 'Petro Express is also 100% owned by Chavez.' This is false. Petro Express is a chain of gas stations/convenience stores wholly owned by a U.S. company based in North Carolina. Until recently, Petro Express did sell gasoline purchased from Citgo Petroleum Corp., but the company announced in October 2006 that it would phase out the Citgo product from all of its 66 stations by 2007.
  In the present case we are asked to eschew gasoline from Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned petroleum company, because that nation's president has made anti-American statements. Sounds straightforward enough, but another very popular email flier says we shouldn't buy gas from the Middle East because terrorists come from that region (in fact, Citgo is named as a preferred alternative to these brands). Yet another forwarded message calls for a one-day boycott of all brands of gasoline to let OPEC know we're fed up with inflated prices. What's a consumer to do?
  The upshot? By all means, boycott Citgo gasoline if your conscience moves you to, but bear in mind that if you continue to use gasoline at all, whatever the brand, you can't help but put money in Hugo Chavez's pocket. According to industry sources, the folks most likely to be hurt by such a boycott are the independent U.S. owners of Citgo-branded stations, not the Venezuelan government.
  Q. Where did this message come from?
  A. It was originally issued in January 2006 as an 'action alert' by the American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group.
  Q. Is it true that Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez vowed on television to 'bring down the U.S. government'?
  A. That's one interpretation of his actual words: 'Enough of imperialist aggression; we must tell the world: down with the U.S. empire. We have to bury imperialism this century.'
  Arguably, when Chavez said 'down with the U.S. empire,' he was referring to U.S. foreign policy, not the country itself, nor its people, nor its government. It's standard far-left anti-imperialist rhetoric, and was certainly interpreted as such by the mainstream media. Associated Press, for example, characterized the speech as an invective against 'U.S. dominance.' Reuters described it as a campaign against 'U.S. free-market policies in South America.'
  In any case, while it is crystal clear that Chavez hates United States foreign policy, his statements fell well short of a declaration of war.
  Q. Was anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan present when Chavez made the speech?
  A. Yes. The photograph above showing the two standing arm-in-arm was distributed by Reuters. Both Sheehan and Chavez made statements from the podium criticizing President Bush and the U.S. presence in Iraq.
  Q. Did Harry Belafonte also make a TV appearance with Chavez during which the entertainer called President Bush 'the greatest terrorist in the world'?
  A. Yes, on January 8, 2006.
  Q. Is Chavez an ally of Fidel Castro, and is he 'pushing a socialist revolution'?
  A. Yes, and yes.
  Q. Is Hugo Chavez a 'dictator'?
  A. Here we have another exercise in semantics. Judging by a survey of published mentions of the Venezuelan leader, it appears the way one answers this question depends upon one's political bias. Those left of center like to point out that Chavez was democratically elected -- twice -- and continues to be regarded by many inside and outside Venezuela as a populist visionary. Right-of-center detractors tend to use words like 'strongman,' or 'on the road to becoming a dictator,' or just plain 'dictator' to describe him. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld compared Chavez to Hitler; televangelist Pat Robertson actually called for his assassination. At the other extreme, certified lefties like Cindy Sheehan and Harry Belafonte have praised Chávez for 'supporting life and peace.' The truth surely lies somewhere in between.
  Q. Is Citgo owned by the Venezuelan government?
  A. Yes .
  Q. Can American consumers avoid contributing dollars to Venezuela's treasury by boycotting Citgo gasoline?
  A. Not entirely. See above.

"Citizens Against Breastfeeding","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/citizens_against_breastfeeding.htm","Celebrating Black Breastfeeding Week","2015-08-31 03:17:58","  By Susana Morris
  Black women have some of the lowest rates of breastfeeding in the U.S.  However, every August 25-31 marks Black Breastfeeding Week, which seeks to educate the Black community on the benefits of breastfeeding and to encourage the practice.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that only 62% of black babies born in the US in 2010 started breastfeeding, compared to 79% of white babies. After six months, only 36% still breastfed, compared to 52% of white babies. The CDC notes that this gap between Black women and women of other races is persistent, citing “unsupportive cultural norms, perceptions that breastfeeding is inferior to formula feeding, lack of partner support, and an unsupportive work environment” as key factors to this gap.
  Black Breastfeeding Week comes a few weeks after World Breastfeeding Week , which takes place August 1-7 every year, and “calls for concerted global action to support women to combine breastfeeding and work.
  Whether a woman is working in the formal, non-formal or home setting, it is necessary that she is empowered in claiming her and her baby’s right to breastfeed.”
  Black Breastfeeding Week was started by Kimberly Seals Allers, Kiddada Green, and Anayah Sangodele-Ayoka and founded in 2013. The annual tradition was “created because for over 40 years there has been a gaping racial disparity in breastfeeding rates. The most recent CDC data show that 75% of white women have ever breastfed versus 58.9% of black women.” Allers cites five additional factors that underscore the need for more dialogue on breastfeeding for Black women: high black infant mortality rate, high rates of diet-related disease, lack of diversity in lactation field, unique cultural barriers among black women, and food deserts in Black communities.
  Some argue that part of the stigma goes back to slavery. Monique Sims-Harper , director of A More Excellent Way Health Improvement Organization and a spokeswoman for the California Breastfeeding Coalition, notes that “When blacks came to this country they breastfed their babies and often their masters' babies,” with many continuing to act as wet nurses for white families after slavery. The historical legacy of breastfeeding as unpaid and later low paid labor may have had an adverse effect on black women’s attitudes towards breastfeeding.
  However, it looks like attitudes towards breastfeeding in Black communities are slowly changing.
  Activist Ruth Jeannoel identifies breastfeeding as an “exercise of reproductive justice” and a “revolutionary and political act”: “I choose to breastfeed in public as a way to challenge the notion that Black women do not breastfeed. Not only do we breastfeed, we can do it unapologetically, in your face.”
  Black Breastfeeding Week co-founder Anayah Sangodele-Ayoka, who also is a nurse and midwifery student at Yale University, identifies the role of Black breastfeeding in popular culture as evolving in a good way: “Breastfeeding is part of our history and culture and we know it ensures our children have the best start in life. In previous years, it was unheard of for outlets like Ebony or Essence to talk about breastfeeding as it relates to social justice. Now they’re engaged. Ebony has hosted Twitter conversations with us and the Essence Fest had a lactation station this year.”
  Ultimately, negative attitudes and barriers breastfeeding are not simply cultural ones. American society at large has a great discomfort with breastfeeding even while breasts are often ogled and fetishized. Systemic changes such as routinely providing lactation stations in public places and in the workplace and guaranteed maternity leave are also necessary steps to promoting breastfeeding. Until breastfeeding is made accessible for all women, there will not really be a choice between breastfeeding and formula for breastfeeding mothers.

  'Engineers and experts with the Department, the City of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Cincinnati, the Federal Highway Administration and various consulting groups have each concluded that while several issues require attention, the bridge is safe in its current configuration,' said ODOT Public Information Officer Jocelynn Clemings in a press release. 'If it were thought that these issues posed a significant threat to the motoring public, the bridge would be closed completely to traffic.' The Innerbelt (or Inner Belt) Bridge serves as the crossing for Interstate 90 over the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland. Though studies have determined that the bridge is, in fact, showing signs of deterioration and commercial truck traffic has been banned since November 2008 due to weight concerns, engineers say the span can safely remain open until repairs are completed (some time in 2010). Rumors to the contrary were evidently sparked by reports that meetings were held to discuss disaster contingency plans. 'While it is true that the City of Cleveland Department of Public Safety, Office of Homeland Security, Grants and Technology as well as ODOT officials have met regularly to discuss the plan in the event of a bridge closure,' the ODOT statement continued, 'this is certainly not an indication that the bridge is in any way unsafe or in danger of collapse.'

  Profile of Hillary Clinton
  Analysis: ' The Clinton Body Count ,' a paranoia-laden relic of the Clinton-hating '90s, was resurrected in 2007 to coincide with Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. The widely-circulated text insinuates that several dozen 'friends' of the Clintons, some of whom conceivably possessed incriminating information about the former First Couple, died under 'mysterious' circumstances — i.e., were secretly done away with.
  In more ways than one, it's reminiscent of a similarly paranoid conspiracy theory floated during the Bush-hating '00s, namely the notion that forces within the Bush administration actually conceived and orchestrated the 9/11 terror attacks.
  Both theories rest on absurd presuppositions:
  1. That a U.S. president could secretly order the murders of dozens (or, in Bush's case on 9/11, thousands) of American citizens without being found out, ratted on, prosecuted, impeached, or even so much as accused of such crime by members of Congress, including staunch political opponents.
  2. That a U.S. president could flawlessly carry out such atrocities while demonstrating complete and utter fallibility (if not gross ineptitude) in the face of other, more mundane challenges (e.g., Clinton's inability to squelch accusations of sexual improprieties and avoid impeachment).
  Why is it, we must also ask, that special prosecutor Kenneth Starr , who spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars attempting to dig up dirt of any kind on the Clintons, never handed down a single indictment pertaining to these alleged murders?
  The answer is plain — because the accusations are hogwash.
  According to an article by Philip Weiss in the February 23, 1997 issue of The New York Times Magazine , the earliest version of the Clinton Body Count was authored by Indianapolis attorney Linda Thompson , founder of the right-wing American Justice Federation. The list originally contained the names of 26 alleged victims, though it has grown, and shrunk, and grown again since then, with some variants boasting over 100 names.
  It would be redundant to replicate the thorough research already done by others on the 47 cases listed in this version of the Body Count (see resources below), but for good measure I've documented the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the first five 'victims' on the list:
  James McDougal - Friend and business partner of the Clintons, died of a heart attack — not an apparent heart attack — while serving time on a fraud conviction. McDougal had a pre-existing heart condition. Prison guards placed him in solitary confinement after he refused to take a urine test and failed to provide him with the medications he kept in his cell, according to a subsquent investigation. No foul play was suspected. ('Report Details McDougal's Final Hours,' Houston Chronicle , 14 September 1998.)
  Mary Mahoney - 'One of the first interns to work at the Clinton White House,' according to her family. Not one news source reporting on her murder suggests that Mahoney, a lesbian, was poised to claim 'sexual harassment in the White House.' She died of gunshot wounds along with two other Georgetown, DC Starbucks employees during a botched robbery attempt on July 6, 1997. Per police investigations and a written confession by the killer, Carl Cooper of Washington, DC, Mahoney was shot while struggling with the perpetrator over the keys to the safe. A witness corroborated that Cooper had been planning to rob the Starbucks for at least a month before the crime occurred. ('Starbucks Police Affidavit,' Washington Post , 17 March 1999; 'Solving the Starbucks Case,' Washington Post Magazine Live Online, 3 March 2003.)
  Vince Foster - A lifelong friend of the Clintons, White House aide Vince Foster killed himself with a handgun on July 20, 1993. He had been suffering from depression. No fewer than five official investigations were conducted into the circumstances of his death, and none found evidence of foul play. In 1997, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's own report on the Vince Foster case was unsealed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. It began: 'The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death.' ('Case Closed on Vincent Foster - Again,' St. Louis Post-Dispatch , 15 Oct 1997.)
  Ron Brown - Commerce Secretary under President Clinton, Ron Brown died in a plane crash on April 3, 1996. Conspiracy theorists have alleged that X-rays of Brown's head showed 'possible bullet fragments' in the vicinity of what some described as a 'gunshot wound.' A re-examination conducted by Air Force pathologist Col. William T. Gormley and reviewed by a panel of other military pathologists found 'no bullet, no bone fragments, no metal fragments and, even more telling, no exit wound,' according to Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page. ('The Ron Brown Conspiracy Machine,' Chicago Tribune , 15 January 1998.)
  C. Victor Raiser II and his son, Montgomery Raiser - The prominent Democratic fundraiser and close friend of Bill Clinton died along with his son and four other people in an airplane crash on a fishing trip in Alaska in 1992. Raiser had no known connection with any Clinton scandal, nor was his death in any way 'mysterious.' A National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined that the pilot, who survived the crash, had stalled the plane while trying to veer away at the last minute from a dangerous, cloud-covered mountain pass. ('Air Safety Loophole May Close,' Anchorage Daily News , 18 June 1995.)

  Hillary Clinton is worth at least $5.2 million and as much as $25.5 million, according to personal financial disclosures she filed in 2012 when she was secretary of the Department of State under President Barack Obama .
  She is likely worth more than Obama himself. His net worth is somewhere between $2 million and $7 million , according to his most recent personal financial disclosures.

  In 2007, the last time Clinton filed financial disclosures as a member of the U.S. Senate, she indicated she was worth between $10.4 and $51.2 million, making her the the 12th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate at the time, according to the Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics.
  Meantime, the website 24/7 Wall St. has estimated Bill Clinton's net worth to be about $55 million.
  Republicans have sought to portray the Clintons as out of touch with average Americans because of their wealth, and they seized on remarks Hillary Clinton made in the summer of 2014 about struggling to get out of debt after leaving the White House in 2000.

  Much of that debt was incurred in legal fees stemming from the investigations and scandals that plagued the couple during the Clinton presidency including the Lewinsky affair, which resulted in impeachment .
  Hillary Clinton told ABC News :
  'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt. We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy.'
  A conservative political action committee called American Rising ridiculed her comments, stating:
  'Hillary Clinton JUST said her family struggled ' ... to piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses,' after they left the White House. What she didn’t mention? She had two houses, both mansions, AND in 2013 rented a $100,000 per WEEK summer home in the Hamptons. While American families are struggling to put food on the table, Hillary thinks her situation was bad.'
  The Clintons are said to have earned at least $100 million since leaving the White House in 2001, according to published reports. Nonetheless, Hillary Clinton told The Guardian in 2014 that she didn't consider herself 'truly well off.'
  Of Americans who might see the Clintons as part of the elite 1 percent amid a growing wealth disparity in the United States, she said: 'They don't see me as part of the problem because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we've done it through dint of hard work.'

  So how does Hillary Clinton earn her money?
  Speaking and writing books.
  Hillary Clinton is said to have gotten paid $200,000 for each speech she's given since leaving her post as secretary of the Department of State under President Barack Obama.
  She's also earned millions from writing books.
  Hillary Clinton was paid an $8 million advance for her 2003 autobiography Living History , according to published reports. And she was paid several million more for her 2014 book Hard Choices , which was published as the former U.S. senator was believed to be laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign in the 2016 election .

"Congress Plans to Reinstate the Military Draft","https://www.thebalance.com/all-about-the-draft-3332963","What You Need to Know About the U.S. Military Draft","2004-04-26 03:22:09","  The armed forces of the United States maintain their readiness through voluntary enlistment, but the law requires young men to register through the Selective Service System. This allows a draft to be activated if needed, as was used during the Vietnam War. The draft was not used for the Gulf War or the War on Terrorism. The information below is available in more detail at Selective Service System .
  The obligation of a man to register is imposed by the Military Selective Service Act. Almost all male U.S. citizens, and male aliens living in the U.S., who are 18 through 25, are required to register with the Selective Service.
  Registration is required by law, and there are legal consequences for failing to register. In most cases, these apply to men born after December 31, 1959.
  Fines and Prison: The maximum penalty for failing to register with Selective Service is a $250,000 fine and up to five years in prison. Failure to register will cause ineligibility for some federal and state benefits including:
  President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 which created the country's first peacetime draft and formally established the Selective Service System as an independent Federal agency. Even before this, our country has a long history of drafting citizens to serve in the armed forces.
  From 1948 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the armed forces which could not be filled through voluntary means. The draft ended in 1973, and the U.S. converted to an all-volunteer military.
  The registration requirement was suspended in April 1975. It was resumed again in 1980 by President Carter in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Registration continues today as a hedge against underestimating the number of servicemen needed in a future crisis.
  The obligation of a man to register is imposed by the Military Selective Service Act. The Act establishes and governs the operations of the Selective Service System.
  If a draft were held today, it would be dramatically different from the one held during the Vietnam War. It was changed to make it more fair and equitable, with fewer deferments allowed. The student deferment was thought to favor more affluent students and send more disadvantaged men into military service. Now, a college student could have his induction postponed only until the end of the current semester. A senior could have it postponed until the end of the academic year.
  Before the lottery was implemented in the latter part of the Vietnam conflict, Local Boards called men classified 1-A, 18 1/2 through 25 years old, oldest first. If you were in that age group, you were at risk of being called up for several years. To eliminate this uncertainty, the lottery system now would call up men turning 20 first, with a lower risk of those for each year after that.
  An initiation of a draft would require action by both Congress and the President. Congress would have to pass legislation initiating a draft , and the legislation would have to be passed into law by the signature of the President.
  The selective service would be activated, and they would initiate a draft lottery, which is based on the birth dates of registrants. This lottery establishes the priority in which they are called to service. The first men drafted would be those turning age 20 during the calendar year of the lottery. Those turning 21 in the year of the draft would be the second priority, those turning 22 would be the third priority, and so forth until the year in which they turn 26 at which time they are over the age of liability. Younger men would not be called in that year until men in the 20-25 age group are called.
  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a unique random calendar and number selection program for Selective Service. Using this random selection method for birthdays, each day of the year is selected by computer in a random manner, and that date is placed in a capsule and loaded in a large drum on a random basis.
  By the same method, numbers from 1 to 365 (366 for men born in a leap year) are also selected in a random fashion, placed in capsules, and the capsules are placed into a second drum. Official observers certify that the capsule-filling and drum-loading were conducted according to established procedures. This certification is secured to each drum; they are sealed and placed in secure storage.
  Here is how the lottery would work: One capsule is drawn from the drum containing birth dates January 1 through December 31. One capsule is then drawn from the drum containing the sequence numbers from 1 through 365 (366 if the draft will call men born during a leap year) and the date and number are paired to establish the sequence number for each birth date. This is done in full view of all observers, officials, and the media.
  For example, if the date of August 4 is drawn first from the 'date' drum, and the sequence number of 32 is drawn from the 'numbers' drum at the same time, then those men turning 20 on August 4 would be ordered for induction processing only after men whose birthdays drew sequence numbers 1 through 31. The drawings continue until all 365 (or 366) birthdays of the year are paired with a sequence number.
  After the lottery is completed and results certified, the sequence of call is transmitted to the Selective Service System's Data Management Center. Almost immediately the first induction notices are prepared and sent via mailgram to men whose birth dates drew the lowest lottery numbers.
  Registrants with low lottery numbers are ordered to report for a physical, mental, and moral evaluation at a Military Entrance Processing Station to determine whether they are fit for military service. Once he is notified of the results of the evaluation, a registrant will be given 10 days to file a claim for exemption, postponement, or deferment.
  The MEPs would then apply a classification to the inductee. Each inductee is classified based on their beliefs and circumstances, determining who is deferred or exempted.
  Classifications are only applied once the draft is activated by the Congress and the President. At that time, inductees are assessed and can apply for exemptions, deferments, and postponements from military service. A man may appeal his classification to a Selective Service Appeal Board. Here is a list of some, though not all, current classifications and what they mean:
  Here is a list of codes that were used previously (Vietnam era and before):
  When Stop Loss is in effect, members of the military are not allowed to separate or retire. Some people point to it as a backdoor draft and a sign that a real draft is just around the corner. But the program has been in place for years, and it only affects soldiers who have received official notification of an upcoming deployment. Even then, the soldier may separate or retire after the deployment is complete. The program has nothing to do with the draft.
  In 2005, the Army had a tough four-month period where they missed their monthly recruiting goals, and then their annual recruiting goal by about 8,000 troops. This was because Congress had authorized the active-duty Army to increase by 20,000 troops, and the Army tried to do this all in one year.
  Instead of a draft, the Army addressed the issue by adding more recruiters, implementing new recruiting incentives , including increasing enlistment bonuses and raising the maximum enlistment age . The Army also accepted more prior service applicants, set higher college loan repayment limits and increased the Army College Fund contributions. The active duty services were able to meet their recruiting goals.
  In the late 90s, all of the military services , except for the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, missed their recruiting goals for four straight years in a row. It didn't result in a military draft.
  There are several ways reinstating the draft would have a negative impact.

  The Congressional Reform Act, to many critics, sounds good on paper. The purported legislation would place term limits on members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate , and strip lawmakers of their public pensions .

  If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is.
  The Congressional Reform Act is a work of fiction, a sort of angry taxpayer's manifesto that went viral on the Web and continues to be forwarded and forwarded again, with little regard for facts.
  That's right. No member of Congress has introduced such a bill - and none would, given the widely circulated email's numerous half-truths and bogus claims.
  So if you're wondering when the Congressional Reform Act will pass the House and Senate, here's a little tip: It won't.
  Here is one version of the Congressional Reform Act email:
  Subject: Congressional Reform Act of 2011
  The 26th amendment (granting the right to vote for 18 year-olds) took only 3 months & 8 days to be ratified! Why? Simple! The people demanded it. That was in 1971…before computers, before e- mail, before cell phones, etc.
  Of the 27 amendments to the Constitution , seven (7) took 1 year or less to become the law of the land…all because of public pressure.
  I'm asking each addressee to forward this email to a minimum of twenty people on their address list; in turn ask each of those to do likewise.
  In three days, most people in The United States of America will have the message.
  This is one idea that really should be passed around.
  Congressional Reform Act of 2011
  Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career. The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work.
  If each person contacts a minimum of twenty people then it will only take three days for most people (in the U.S.) to receive the message. Maybe it is time.
  THIS IS HOW YOU FIX CONGRESS!!!!! If you agree with the above, pass it on. If not, just delete
  You are one of my 20+. Please keep it going.
  There are numerous errors in the Congressional Reform Act email.
  Let's start with the most obvious one - the incorrect assumption that members of Congress don't pay into the Social Security system. They are required to pay social security payroll taxes under federal law .
  Also see: Salaries and Benefits of U.S. Congress Members
  That wasn't always the case, though. Before 1984 members of Congress did not pay into Social Security . But they also were not eligible to claim Social Security benefits. At the time they participated in what was called the Civil Service Retirement System.
  The 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act all members of Congress to participate in Social Security as of Jan. 1, 1984, regardless of when they first entered Congress.
  As far as pay raises, cost-of-living-adjustments tied to inflation - such as the Congressional Reform Act email suggests - take effect annually unless Congress votes to not accept it. Members of Congress do not vote themselves pay raises, as the email suggests.
  Also see: Even in Recession, Congress Pay Grew
  There are other problems with the Congressional Reform Act email, including the claim that all Americans buy their own retirement plans. Studies show that most full-time workers actually participate in an employee-sponsored retirement plan. Members of Congress get retirement benefits under the same plans available to other federal employees.
  Meantime, members of Congress already are subject to the same laws the rest of us are , despite claims to the contrary by the Congressional Reform Act email.
  But let's not quibble over details. The point is: The Congressional Reform Act isn't a real piece of legislation. Even if it were, what are the chances members of Congress would vote to eliminate perks and jeopardize their own job security?

"Congressional Pensions vs. Social Security","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/uscongress/a/congresspay.htm","Salaries and Benefits of US Congress Members: The Truth","2009-06-13 15:08:47","  By Robert Longley
  A massively-sent chain email states, “Many citizens had no idea that members of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term.” Well, maybe many citizens do not have that idea, because it is just flat wrong. Another infamous email demanding passage of a mythical “ Congressional Reform Act ” claims members of Congress do not pay Social Security taxes. That, too, is wrong
  Salaries and benefits of members of the U.S. Congress have been the source of taxpayer unhappiness and myths over the years. Here are some facts for your consideration.
  As of 2015, the base salary for all rank-and-file members of the U.S. House and Senate is $174,000 per year, plus benefits. Salaries have not been increased since 2009. Compared to private-sector salaries, the salaries of members of Congress is lower than many mid-level executives and managers.
  Also See: The 10 Wealthiest Members of Congress
  The current salary (2016) for rank-and-file members of the House and Senate is $174,000 per year.
  Leaders of the House and Senate are paid a higher salary than rank-and-file members.
  Majority Party Leader - $193,400 Minority Party Leader - $193,400
  Speaker of the House - $223,500 Majority Leader - $193,400 Minority Leader - $193,400
  Members of Congress are eligible to receive the same annual cost-of-living increase given to other federal employees, if any. The raise takes effect automatically on January 1 of each year unless Congress, through passage of a joint resolution , votes to decline it, as Congress has done since 2009.
  You may have read that Members of Congress do not pay into Social Security. Well, that's a myth.
  Prior to 1984, neither Members of Congress nor any other federal civil service employee paid Social Security taxes. Of course, they were also not eligible to receive Social Security benefits. Members of Congress and other federal employees were instead covered by a separate pension plan called the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act required federal employees first hired after 1983 to participate in Social Security. These amendments also required all Members of Congress to participate in Social Security as of January 1, 1984, regardless of when they first entered Congress. Because the CSRS was not designed to coordinate with Social Security, Congress directed the development of a new retirement plan for federal workers . The result was the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986.
  Members of Congress receive retirement and health benefits under the same plans available to other federal employees. They become vested after five years of full participation.
  Note: Starting in 2014, the only health care coverage made available to members of Congress and their employees by the federal government will be coverage offered through the Health Insurance Exchange created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - the ' Obamacare Act .'
  Members elected since 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). Those elected prior to 1984 were covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). In 1984 all members were given the option of remaining with CSRS or switching to FERS.
  As it is for all other federal employees , congressional retirement is funded through taxes and the participants' contributions. Members of Congress under FERS contribute 1.3 percent of their salary into the FERS retirement plan and pay 6.2 percent of their salary in Social Security taxes.
  Members of Congress are not eligible for a pension until they reach the age of 50, but only if they've completed 20 years of service. Members are eligible at any age after completing 25 years of service or after they reach the age of 62 . Please also note that Members of Congress have to serve at least 5 years to even receive a pension.
  The amount of a congressperson's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of his or her salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary.
  According to the Congressional Research Service, 413 retired Members of Congress were receiving federal pensions based fully or in part on their congressional service as of Oct. 1, 2006. Of this number, 290 had retired under CSRS and were receiving an average annual pension of $60,972. A total of 123 Members had retired with service under both CSRS and FERS or with service under FERS only. Their average annual pension was $35,952 in 2006.
  Members of Congress are also provided with an annual allowance intended to defray expenses related carrying out their congressional duties, including 'official office expenses, including staff, mail, travel between a Member's district or state and Washington, DC, and other goods and services.'
  Many members of Congress retain their private careers and other business interests while they serve. Members are allowed to retain an amount of permissible 'outside earned income' limited to no more than 15% of the annual rate of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule for federal employees, or $26,550 a year in 2013. However, there is currently no limit on the amount of non-salary income members can retain from their investments, corporate dividends or profits.
  House and Senate rules define what sources of 'outside earned income' are permissible. For example, House Rule XXV (112th Congress) limits permissible outside income to 'salaries, fees, and other amounts received or to be received as compensation for personal services actually rendered.' Members are not allowed to retain compensation arising from fiduciary relationships, except for medical practices. Members are also barred from accepting honoraria - payments for professional services typically provided without charge.
  Perhaps most importantly to voters and taxpayers, member of Congress are strictly prohibited from earning or accepting income that may appear to be intended to influence the way they vote on legislation.
  Members are allowed to deduct up to $3,000 a year from their federal income tax for living expenses while they are away from their home states or congressional districts.

  Analysis: The quote from Warren Buffett is accurate — he uttered the quip about ending the deficit in five minutes during a July 7, 2011 interview with CNBC's Becky Quick — but the chain letter above was neither written nor endorsed by Buffett.
  Nor is the 'Congressional Reform Act' an actual piece of legislation. It has never been introduced in Congress in any form (including as a Constitutional amendment). The text originated as an anonymous email in November 2009 (though Buffett's name wasn't added till 2011), and is similar in both theme and content to the ' Proposed 28th Amendment ' chain letter that began circulating around the same time.
  Some elements of the proposal are based on misconceptions about Congressional pay and benefits.

"Debunking the Presidents","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/historical/a/presidents.htm","Debunking the Presidents","2005-02-07 18:05:35","  By David Emery
  IN THE modern age U.S. presidents are routine targets of public derision, often deservedly. While political barbs are nothing new, 100 and 200 years ago we saw our leaders as having been cut from a different, more noble cloth than politicians of today. Presidential folklore, in the form of jokes, legends, and historical errata, reflects that.
  As a child, George Washington could not tell a lie, or so the story goes, even if it meant confessing to chopping down his father's beloved cherry tree . It's 'common knowledge' that young Abraham Lincoln wrote his homework on the back of a shovel with a lump of coal because he didn't have a pencil — no lame excuses from 'Honest Abe.' As a young storekeeper in New Salem, Illinois, Lincoln walked a mile on foot to return a customer's change.

  These are examples of the sort of 'true grit' qualities we wish for in our national leaders.
  From 'The Great Emancipator' to 'The Obamination'
  Every American of a certain age was raised on such tales, some true, most not. The crux of presidential folklore isn't the veracity of the stories, but how well they jibe with our sense of the men's characters.
  Presidential nicknames illustrate the point. Lincoln is remembered as 'The Great Emancipator.'  Washington was 'The Father of His Country.'  Jefferson, 'The Sage of Monticello.'  The most mythic of contemporary presidents, Ronald Reagan, earned the title 'The Great Communicator.' Bill Clinton was tarred from day one with the nickname 'Slick Willy,' an appellation only slightly less ignominious than 'Tricky Dick,' Richard Nixon's earned sobriquet. G.W. Bush's most popular nickname was 'Dubya,' a take-off on his middle initial. In some quarters he was known unflatteringly as 'Shrub' or 'Dumbya.' The charismatic Barack Obama, who campaigned on the lofty slogans 'Hope' and 'Change,' became known to his detractors as (sarcastically) 'The One,' 'The Obamessiah,' and (in all seriousness) 'The Obamination.'
  Wooden Teeth and the Gettysburg Address
  Other bits of presidential folklore are more on the order of historical boo-boos. It's said, for example, that Washington's dentures were made of wood. They were not. Nor were they manufactured by Paul Revere, as many people believe. Longstanding tradition holds that Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope, which is also untrue. Grand speeches are rarely dashed off in the manner of pop songs.
  Another curious, often-repeated myth pertaining to Honest Abe holds that the hands of his statue in the Lincoln Memorial were intentionally sculpted to form the letters 'A' and 'L' in American Sign Language. Not so, according to the National Park Service . The 'hidden message' was purely coincidental. Also untrue is the odd claim that the face of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, Lincoln's nemesis during the Civil War, was secretly carved into back of the same statue. What would the American mythos be without its conspiracy theories ?

  Example: Email text contributed by A. Benjamin, Aug. 18, 2004:
  Denzel Washington interview with Katie Couric 8/13/04
  I bet this one will never see the light of day again. I think I'll ask NBC for a copy of the videotape of this segment. Will be interesting to see how/if they respond.
  Did You See or Hear About This
  Did you see the Denzel Washington interview with Katie Couric on NBC last Friday morning (13 August 2004)? Not many people are talking about it. They are wishing it would go away and are trying to sweep it under the rug. But it's not going to happen! It basically went like this.
  ********************
  Meryl Streep and Denzel were on the today show 'live' with Katie Couric to talk about the movie 'Manchurian Candidate.'
  At one point Katie asked Denzel, 'have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?' To which Denzel replied, 'No, and I have no intentions on seeing it.' Katie and Meryl were 'so noticeably' taken aback! It was so cool!
  Then, a discourse (or more preferably, a fight!) began between all three of them with Denzel being barraged with all kinds of anti-Bush, anti-republican comments, but 'the man stood his ground' and soon enraged the women so much that they couldn't get a word in edgewise. Meryl Streep turned blood red and she sat with her legs crossed and her one leg shaking up and down, fuming! Then Katie uttered the words that put the final nail in her coffin, she said to Denzel 'you see, that's the problem I have with 'you people.'
  She of course did not get to finish her sentence because Denzel pounced on her verbally by responding 'YOU PEOPLE! YOU PEOPLE! Just what do you mean you people! Do you mean 'You People' as in me as a Christian, or do you mean 'You People' as in me as a REPUBLICAN? She then tap danced her way through the next minute of the show. But Denzel went out fighting and declaring that Fahrenheit 9/11 is nothing but propaganda and lies distorted to support a cynical democratic film director's views.
  Whoo hoo!! I love the man!
  There's a celebrity that deserves to wear the uniform in movies and I don't mind at all. Everybody else is a hypocrite!
  1. Couric did not ask Denzel Washington if he had seen Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 , nor did Washington announce he has no intention of seeing the film. The actual exchange proceeded as follows:
  Washington: 'You know, I haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11 , because I live in America. I grew up here. I'm an ex-slave. I'm a result of what this country can do. So it's nothing knew to me. I'm not surprised at all. It's just business as usual...'
  2. At no point did Washington call Moore's film 'nothing but propaganda and lies distorted to support a cynical democratic film director's views.'
  3. At no point was Washington 'barraged with all kinds of anti-Bush, anti-Republican comments' by the others present. In fact, it was he who dominated the political discussion.
  4. Couric did not say, 'You see, that's the problem I have with 'you people.''
  5. At no point did Denzel Washington respond with anything resembling, 'Do you mean 'You People' as in me as a Christian, or do you mean 'You People' as in me as a REPUBLICAN?'
  This segment of the conversation actually began with Couric asking Washington how he felt about the frequently-made statement that 'Hollywood folks should stick to acting.'
  'I'm not a Hollywood folk,' Washington protested. 'I don't know who they are.'
  Washington: 'Ah, there you go. Am I one of those people? Hmmm, isn't that interesting?'
  Couric: 'Oh, stop, stop, stop.'
  Washington: 'No, don't stop. I heard what you just said. 'Am I one of those people?' No, I'm not.'
  Couric: 'No, are you an actor who would rather not '
  Washington: 'No, I'm not that either. I'm a human being. My job is acting.'
  Couric: 'Okay, are you somebody who would rather not express his political views publicly? I mean how do you feel about that? Some people are more outspoken than others...'
  The interview ended with these comments by Manchurian Candidate director Jonathan Demme:
  'It's fundamental to a democracy that you're not only permitted to speak out, you're supposed to have an opinion, you're supposed to speak out, you're supposed to engage in a discourse. And in this way, we arrive at ideas that can move us forward in a positive fashion. I wish everybody could get on TV and talk about how they feel. Maybe we'd learn something.'

  Analysis: This juxtaposition of images delivers a powerful political message contrasting President Barack Obama, portrayed as a regular guy casually fist-bumping a janitor, with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, presented as a man of wealth and privilege indulging in what appears to be an impromptu shoeshine on an airport tarmac.
  While the photos are real, however, their implied message is undercut by one simple fact: a closer look at the photo of Romney reveals he's undergoing a pre-flight security screening, not having his shoes shined. It was taken at the San Diego Airport just before Romney boarded a plane to Denver for a campaign event on Feb. 1, 2008.

  Analysis: In reality, Barack Obama has two daughters, and no sons. The text and photo above originated in a satirical (i.e., fictitious) article published on the humor website The Onion on Sep. 6, 2012.
  Judging from the credulous responses to Facebook postings of this article, some people are unaware that TheOnion.com is a satirical website — as in, everything published on the site is fictitious and meant to be laughed at, not taken seriously.
  Think about it. If a heretofore unknown illegitimate son of the President of the United States had been paraded before the delegates of the Democratic National Convention, not to mention the national media, you would have read about it first somewhere other than The Onion .
  In this age of viral information sharing, it pays to check the legitimacy of sources before believing what they say. It's a no-brainer. Pass it on.
  More examples of satire mistaken for fact: • Mitt Romney: 'I Was Too Important to Go to Vietnam' • Mitt Romney: 'Of Course I'll Win, I'm the White Guy' • Ann Romney: Equal Pay 'Detrimental to the Future of Women' • Obama Explains 'Refusal' to Salute the Flag

  Seriously, Senator Reid has a face of a Saint - A Saint Bernard. Now I know why they call you the arithmetic man. You add partisanship, subtract pleasure, divide attention, and multiply ignorance. Reid is so physically unimposing, he makes Pee Wee Herman look like Mr. T. And Reid's so dumb, he makes Speaker Pelosi look like an intellectual. Nevada is soooo screwed! If I were less polite, I'd say Reid makes Kevin Federline look successful.
  Speaking of the Speaker... Nancy Pelosi, hubba, hubba! Hey baby, you must've been something before electricity. Seriously, the Speaker may look like an idiot and talk like an idiot but don't let that fool you. She really is an idiot. Madame Speaker... want to make twelve bucks the hard way?

  It's doubtful any Don Rickles fans would have mistaken it for his work given that Rickles has never done political humor. 'I don't get into politics,' said Rickles in a recent interview.

  Gas Tips
  I've been in petroleum pipeline business for about 31 years, currently working for the Kinder-Morgan Pipeline here in San Jose, CA. We deliver about 4 million gallons in a 24-hour period from the pipe line; one day it's diesel, the next day it's jet fuel and gasoline. We have 34 storage tanks here with a total capacity of 16,800,000 gallons. Here are some tricks to help you get your money's worth.
  1. Fill up your car or truck in the morning when the temperature is still cool. Remember that all service stations have their storage tanks buried below ground; and the colder the ground, the denser the gasoline. When it gets warmer gasoline expands, so if you're filling up in the afternoon or in the evening, what should be a gallon is not exactly a gallon. In the petroleum business, the specific gravity and temperature of the fuel (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, ethanol and other petroleum products) are significant. Every truckload that we load is temperature-compensated so that the indicated gallonage is actually the amount pumped. A one-degree rise in temperature is a big deal for businesses, but service stations don't have temperature compensation at their pumps.
  2. If a tanker truck is filling the station's tank at the time you want to buy gas, do not fill up; most likely dirt and sludge in the tank is being stirred up when gas is being delivered, and you might be transferring that dirt from the bottom of their tank into your car's tank.
  3. Fill up when your gas tank is half-full (or half-empty), because the more gas you have in your tank the less air there is and gasoline evaporates rapidly, especially when it's warm. (Gasoline storage tanks have an internal floating 'roof' membrane to act as a barrier between the gas and the atmosphere, thereby minimizing evaporation.)
  4. If you look at the trigger you'll see that it has three delivery settings: slow, medium and high. When you're filling up do not squeeze the trigger of the nozzle to the high setting. You should be pumping at the slow setting, thereby minimizing vapors created while you are pumping. Hoses at the pump are corrugated; the corrugations act as a return path for vapor recovery from gas that already has been metered. If you are pumping at the high setting, the agitated gasoline contains more vapor, which is being sucked back into the underground tank so you're getting less gas for your money.
  Hope this will help ease your 'pain at the pump'.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Analysis: As I researched the contents of this much-discussed viral text, I found disagreement among presumed experts as to the accuracy of the specific claims, but a general consensus that whatever modest savings might result from following these measures, they're probably more trouble than they're worth.
  Let's take them one by one:
  1. Fill your tank in the morning when the temperature is cooler so you get more volume for your money?
  Yes and no. The basic science behind this is correct. Liquids expand as they warm. The figure usually cited for gasoline is about a 1 percent increase in volume per 15-degree rise in temperature. Therefore, if you buy 20 gallons of gas at a 90-degree temperature, due to expansion you end up with about 2 percent less product for your money than you would have gotten had you pumped 60-degree gasoline. At a retail price of $3.00 per gallon that differential would cost you $1.20.
  The thing is, given that the gasoline is pumped from huge underground tanks wherein the temperature is less variable than that of the outside air, it's very unlikely you would encounter a 30-degree variance in fuel temperature in a 24-hour period. In fact, says a physicist interviewed by KLTV News in Jacksonville, over the course of a day the fuel temperature probably varies no more than a scant few degrees, so the actual savings from pumping in the morning would likely amount to only a few cents per fill-up.
  2. Don't pump gas if a tanker truck is filling the station's holding tanks, because you'll end up putting dislodged sediment into your own tank?
  Probably not. Modern gasoline holding tanks and pumping systems contain filters designed to block any such debris from reaching your car's gas tank. Should some particles squeak by, your engine's fuel filter ought to have no problem taking care of them.
  3. Pump gas when your tank is no more than half-empty, because the emptier the tank the more you will lose to evaporation?
  Yes and no. The idea here seems to be that the more unfilled space there is in the tank the more gasoline will be able to evaporate and escape into the atmosphere when you open the cap. Which makes sense, although according to physicist Ted Forringer the actual amount of vapor lost this way would be minuscule, adding up to only a few cents' worth per fill-up. A more important concern is the quality and fit of your gas cap, the job of which, in part, is to minimize evaporation on an ongoing basis. By one estimate, a poorly sealed gas cap can result in the evaporation of a gallon of gas in just two weeks' time.
  4. Pump gas at the low-speed rather than the high-speed setting because the latter causes more agitation, thus more evaporation?
  Probably not. It does seem logical to assume that the higher the speed of the pump the more it may agitate the fuel, causing more evaporation. But consider this: the longer it takes to pump the fuel the more evaporation can occur too, so any benefits to pumping at the slower speed are probably negated.
  If all this just leaves you feeling frustrated and confused, don't despair. Edmunds.com has actually tested some of the most common gas-saving tips and shares the ones that really work here and here .

"Don't Wear Campaign Gear at Polling Places","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/electioneering.htm","Email: Don't Wear Campaign Garb at Polling Places","2008-09-24 17:32:15","  Email rumor warns Barack Obama supporters not to wear Obama shirts, pins, hats, or other paraphernalia to polling places because it is considered campaigning (electioneering) under the law and grounds for officials to turn voters away.
  Description: Email rumor Circulating since: Sep. 2008 Status: Varies by state
  Example #1: Email contributed by Elena W., Sep. 23, 2008:
  Example #2: Email contributed by Thomas L., Sep. 24, 2008:
  Example #3: Email contributed by Kenneth D., Sep. 24, 2008:
  Analysis: Laws against campaigning or 'electioneering' in and around polling places are pretty much universal, though each state boasts its own specific regulations and varying degrees of enforcement.
  The majority of states use language prohibiting voters and poll workers from 'distributing,' 'circulating,' 'posting,' or 'exhibiting' campaign materials within 10 to 200 feet of polling places.
  This is sometimes interpreted as including buttons, t-shirts, hats, and other political garb (often called 'passive electioneering'), but is more often restricted to signs, posters, fliers, pamphlets, and the like.
  At least 10 states -- Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont -- explicitly prohibit the wearing of pins, buttons, stickers, labels, or other 'political insignia.'
  Passive electioneering in Pennsylvania
  The timing, specificity, and emphatic tone of this email suggest it was prompted by recent events in Pennsylvania, where the interpretation of a law prohibiting electioneering has long been left up to individual counties, resulting in its inconsistent application across the state. After citizens in some localities complained that they were prevented from voting or were asked to remove articles of clothing because they wore political-themed buttons or t-shirts, the ACLU requested a clarification of the law.
  In response, Pennsylvania elections commissioner Chet Harhut sent a memo to county elections boards in September 2008 declaring that wearing buttons or t-shirts is not sufficient grounds to prevent anyone from voting. However, the law still leaves it largely to the discretion of local officials, some of whom have stated they will not change their criteria.
  At last report, the Republican Party was petitioning the state to enforce a statewide ban on passive electioneering. The Democratic Party declined to join the effort.
  Voters should check local regulations
  There's room to debate the constitutionality of such restrictions, but right or wrong they are currently the law in some parts of the country, so it behooves individual voters to familiarize themselves with the regulations of their own states and act accordingly.
  Contact your state or local elections board for specific guidelines. If in doubt, leave the campaign paraphernalia at home.
  Poll: Do you think campaign buttons and t-shirts should be allowed in polling places? 1) Yes . 2) No . 3) Not sure .

  Viral op-ed piece by Roger Starner Jones, M.D., an emergency room physician in Jackson, Mississippi, says America's health care problems are due to a 'crisis of culture,' not a shortage of quality medical care.
  Description: Viral op-ed / Forwarded email Circulating since: Aug. 2009 Status: Correctly attributed / Text slightly altered (see details below)
  Example #1: As posted on Facebook, Sep. 22, 2010:
  Pictured is a young physician by the name of Dr. Roger Starner Jones. His short two-paragraph letter to the White House accurately puts the blame on a 'Culture Crisis' instead of a 'Health Care Crisis'. It's worth a quick read:
  Dear Mr. President:
  During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. While glancing over her patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as 'Medicaid'!
  During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one pack of cigarettes every day, eats only at fast-food take-outs, and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? I contend that our nation's 'health care crisis' is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Rather, it is the result of a 'crisis of culture' a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. It is a culture based in the irresponsible credo that 'I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me'.
  Once you fix this 'culture crisis' that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.
  Respectfully, ROGER STARNER JONES, MD

  This was a 'letter to the editor' in yesterdays (August 29) Jackson, MS newspaper.
  Dear Sirs:
  'During my last night's shift in the ER, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient with a shiny new gold tooth, multiple elaborate tattoos, a very expensive brand of tennis shoes and a new cellular telephone equipped with her favorite R&B tune for a ringtone. Glancing over the chart, one could not help noticing her payer status: Medicaid.
  She smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and, somehow, still has money to buy beer. And our president expects me to pay for this woman's health care?
  Our nation's health care crisis is not a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. It is a crisis of culture - a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. A culture that thinks 'I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me'.
  Life is really not that hard. Most of us reap what we sow.
  STARNER JONES, MD
  Analysis: The texts above are slightly altered versions of an actual letter to the editor published in the Jackson, Mississippi Clarion Ledger on August 23, 2009. It was signed 'Starner Jones, M.D.'
  The original letter is no longer accessible via the Clarion Ledger archives, but based on the earliest repostings I've been able to find online, this is what it actually said:
  During my last shift in the ER, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient with a shiny new gold tooth, multiple elaborate tattoos and a new cellular telephone equipped with her favorite R&B tune for a ringtone.

  Life is really not that hard. Most of us reap what we sow.
  Starner Jones, MD Jackson, MS
  As some public critics were quick to point out, Dr. Jones took the liberty of drawing some rather sweeping conclusions based on a single incident. He defended his original statements in a follow-up letter to the same newspaper five months later:
  Starner Jones, M.D. Jackson, MS January 11, 2010
  I continue to receive numerous phone calls, letters, emails and face-to-face comments about my letter ('Why Pay For the Care of the Careless') which appeared in your newspaper a few months ago.
  Most people express highest approval for the opinion set forth. Indeed, the truth has an illuminating quality all its own.
  However, a few have disagreed and all of them falsely assume that a person who holds the views which I espouse must have been raised in a privileged home. Nothing could be further from the truth.
  I grew up in a lower middle class, single parent home in the rural hill country of Pontotoc, Mississippi. While attending public schools, I paid attention in class and did my homework. I ran with the right crowd and stayed out of trouble. My dedication in school resulted in a full-paid scholarship to the prestigious University of the South in Sewanee, TN. After college, I left to go to medical school with everything I owned in three bags. The rest is history.
  Motivation, not entitlement, is the key to personal success and happiness in life.
  As best I can tell, Dr. Jones has made no further public statements on the matter.

"Election Day Switch","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/CampaignsElections/a/Open-Primary-Definition.htm","Open Primary Definition","2012-05-07 19:08:14","  By Tom Murse
  An open primary is one in which voters can take part in either the Democratic or Republican nominating contests regardless of their party affiliation. Voters registered with third-parties and independents are also allowed to take part in open primaries.
  An open primary is the opposite of a closed primary, in which only registered members of that party can take part. In a closed primary, in other words, registered Republicans are allowed to vote only in the Republican primary, and registered Democrats are allowed to vote only in the Democratic primary.
  Voters registered with third-parties and independents are not permitted to take part in closed primaries.
  Supporters of the open primary system argue that it encourages voter participation and leads to greater turnout at the polls.
  A growing segment of the U.S. population is not affiliated with either the Republican or Democratic parties, and is therefore blocked from taking part in closed presidential primaries.
  Supporters also argue that holding an open primary leads to the nomination of more centrist and less ideologically pure candidates who have broad appeal.
  Allowing voters of any party to take part in either the Republican or Democratic presidential primary often invites mischief, commonly referred to as party-crashing.
  Party-crashing occurs when voters of one party support 'the most polarizing candidate in the other party's primary to bolster the chances that it will nominate someone 'unelectable' to general election voters in November,' according to the nonpartisan Center for Voting and Democracy in Maryland.
  In the 2012 Republican primaries , for example, Democratic activists launched a somewhat organized effort to prolong the GOP nomination process by voting for Rick Santorum , an underdog, in states that held open primaries.
  That effort, called Operation Hilarity , was organized by activist Markos Moulitsas Zuniga , the founder and publisher of Daily Kos , a popular blog among liberals and Democrats. 'The longer this GOP primary drags on, the better the numbers for Team Blue,' Moulitsas wrote.
  In 2008, many Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary because they felt she had less of a chance of defeating presumed Republican nominee John McCain , a U.S. senator from Arizona.
  Here is a list of states that held open presidential primaries or caucuses in 2012, according to the Center for Voting and Democracy:

My grandfather walking up the stairs smiling. I screamed in happiness. 'How did you make the trip?' I asked. 'Who brought you here? Why didn't you call me?' The last I knew, my grandfather was sick in bed and that was some days before. He then told me that he came to visit me for a moment. I was upset at that.
  'He then asked, 'Where is your son?' I told him he was finally sleep. I told him how I felt so alone and disappointed at motherhood, and scared. He stopped me and with a hug and told me to make me some coffee. He told me, 'Now it's time for me to leave. I came to bless your son and it is done.' When I went to bed, he tucked me in and looked at me with so much love, and then he said, 'You will have a girl and she will be fine, and you will be fine.' I smiled and then he said, 'Come and give me a hug. I love you so much.' I did, but then I noticed I was hugging the air. Nobody was with me. My first thought was that my grandpa passed away and I called my grandma. Crying, I told grandma what happened, but she kept insisting grandpa was alive and fine. I asked her to check on him. She even put him on the phone. Who came to visit me that morning? Why did he look like grandpa?'
  Numerous books and various websites on the subject of angels are full of anecdotes like this, and many even more incredible. Do guardian angels exist? Do they sometimes come to the aid and comfort of humans in need? Why do they appear to and help some people and not others? Do you have a guardian angel?
  If so, how can you find out? And how can you contact yours?
  A recent poll published in Time magazine revealed that 69 percent of Americans believe in angels, and 46 percent of that group believe they have a personal guardian angel. There is no scientific evidence for angels, of course. The only 'evidence' we have for their existence is the long religious tradition, stories from the Bible and the many anecdotes, like the one above, from people who believe these spiritual beings have affected their lives. Ultimately, angels are a matter of faith, and many believers have offered their opinions on what a guardian angel's role can be in a person's life and even how you can enlist their help.
  WHAT ARE GUARDIAN ANGELS?
  Guardian Angels are thought to be spiritual beings that are 'assigned' to assist people here on Earth in various ways. Whether there is one angel per person, one angel for several person or several angels for one person is open to question. But whether you believe in them or not, or whether you want one or not, believers insist that you do have a guardian angel.
  What is their assignment? According to 'Encounters of the Angelic Kind' at Future365 (now defunct), 'they intercept at many junctures in our lives and help wherever they can to make our lives run smoothly. Sometimes this is by inspiring a thought to spur us into action, at others it is to lend us super-human strength, such as in the case of a woman being able to lift a car long enough to free her trapped child. Or we hear of a runaway truck, with an unconscious driver at the wheel, inexplicably swerving sharply at the last moment to avoid a bus stop queue of people. In fact, there are many instances, which are often put down to luck, coincidence or even a miracle, but which have the touch of a hand of light behind it.'
  So why don't angels come to a person's aid every time it's asked for? Sometimes, the article contends, 'angels must stand back, whilst giving loving support only, as we work things out for ourselves - these are the times when we feel alone, the dark before dawn.'
  Next page: How to contact your guardian angel
  HOW DO WE KNOW ANGELS ARE THERE?
  Even those who believe in the existence of angels concede that they rarely make a physical appearance. However, there are other ways guardian angels can make their presence known, they say.
  'Some people say that they hear angelic sounds totally beyond human description,' according to the article 'Angels' at Future365. 'Others have a feeling of sudden warmth or comfort, or, in times of sadness or grief, a gentle cloak of feathered wings wrapping softly around them.
  Sometimes angel energy may feel entirely different - like a sudden rush of air created by the passing by of an 'angel on a mission' at the speed of light. This is often noticed at times of impending disaster. At other times, simply an inexplicable presence is felt.'
  HOW TO CONTACT YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL
  Robert Graham, in his article 'Angel Talk: Are You Listening' , suggests that we all have guardian angels that are willing to communicate with us, but that most of the time we are just too busy to listen. If we are attentive, he says, and are willing to remain open to this communication, we can receive subtle messages that can help us in our daily lives.
  'If you want a clear and concise message from your angel,' Graham says, 'you must ask a direct question. Your angel will always answer your questions. You must ask your question out loud. Clear, concise questions will get you clear, concise answers. Answers will always be tangible and explicit, something you can put your hands on. The answers I've gotten I could pick up and examine.
  Asking a frivolous question will get you a silly answer. The universe will match your level of sincerity.'
  Angels are always willing to help us, according to Doreen Virtue in her article 'Calling All Angels' on beliefnet, but we have to be willing to accept the assistance since we have free will. 'To ask for angelic assistance, you needn't conduct a formal invocation ceremony,' Virtue says.
  The methods she suggests are likely to be much more familiar and comfortable to most people, including:
  'Connect with Your Angel' suggests yet another method: meditation. 'Make yourself comfortable, sitting or lying down. Be aware of your breathing... Let your body become limp and relaxed. Empty your mind; create space, just as though the whole of the universe was there, inside you. Now just be. No doing. Only being. Communicate to your angel that you wish to connect with her/him. Wait in peace. Be aware of what happens. It may not seem much at first. Be patient. Subtle changes will occur. You may see light, colors or form. You may be aware of a presence. You may feel tingling sensations. You may feel emotion. You will feel love.'
  You'll find even more suggestions for making contact with your guardian angel at '5 Hot Tips for Tuning into Angels,' which details how you can ask or invoke, use stillness for clear reception, use 'heart sensing,' pay them by sending them love, and maintain harmony in your aura and home environment.
  Is all this just superstitious folly? Is the idea of guardian angels just a human invention designed to help people cope with difficult problems? Or are they real beings? The matter cannot be proved or disproved definitively. Perhaps only your own faith or experience can determine their reality for you. If you believe you have had an experience or encounter with an angelic being , please write and tell me about it. Your true story will be included in a future article.

"EPA to Use Poor Kids as Guinea Pigs in Pesticide Study","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/technologyandresearch/a/aboutepa.htm","The US Environmental Protection Agency","2007-05-20 23:18:03","  Just as the U.S. needs the military to protect its interests in the world, so too it needs an agency to police its natural resources at home. Since 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has fulfilled that role, setting and enforcing standards to safeguard the land, air, ​and water as well as protect human health.
  Founded as a federal agency in 1970 following a proposal by President Richard Nixon , the EPA was an outgrowth of the growing public alarm over environmental pollution over the course of a century and a half of immense population and industrial growth. The EPA was established not only to reverse years of neglect and abuse of the environment, but also to ensure that government, industry and the public take better care to protect and respect the fragile balance of nature for future generations.
  Headquartered in Washington, D.C. , the EPA employs more than 18,000 people across the country, including scientists, engineers, lawyers and policy analysts.
  It has 10 regional offices - in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle -- and a dozen laboratories, all headed by an administrator who is appointed by and answers directly to the President of the United States .
  The EPA's primary responsibilities are to develop and enforce environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act , which must be obeyed by federal, state and local governments, as well as by private industry. The EPA helps to formulate environmental laws for passage by Congress and it has the power to issue sanctions and levy fines. Among the EPA's accomplishments are a ban on use of the pesticide DDT; supervising the cleanup of Three Mile Island , site of the nation's worst nuclear power plant mishap; mandating the phased elimination of chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone-depleting chemical found in aerosols; and administering the Superfund , which finances the cleanup of contaminated sites throughout the nation.
  The EPA also assists state governments with their own environmental concerns by providing research grants and graduate fellowships; it supports public education projects to get people directly involved in protecting the environment on a personal and public level; it offers financing assistance to local governments and to small businesses to bring their facilities and practices into compliance with environmental regulations; and offers financial assistance for large-scale improvement projects like the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund , the goal of which is to provide cleaner drinking water.
  Most recently, the EPA has been assigned to lead the federal government’s effort to address climate change and global warming by reducing carbon pollution and emissions of other greenhouse gasses from U.S. transportation and energy sectors. To help all Americans address these issues, the EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program focuses on improving energy efficiency in homes, buildings, and appliances. In addition, the EPA formulates vehicle fuel efficiency and pollution emissions standards. By partnering with states, tribes, and other federal agencies, the EPA works to enhance the ability of local communities to deal with climate change through its Sustainable Communities initiative .
  The EPA also publishes a great deal of information for public and industrial education about protecting the environment and limiting the impact of people and their activities. Its website contains a wealth of information on everything from research findings to regulations and recommendations and educational materials.
  The agency's research programs look for emerging environmental threats and ways to prevent damage to the environment in the first place. The EPA works not only with government and industry within the United States but also with academic entities as well as governments and non-governmental organizations in other countries.
  The agency sponsors partnerships and programs with industrial, governmental, academic and non-profits on a voluntary basis to encourage environmental responsibility, energy conservation, and pollution prevention. Among its programs are those that work to eliminate greenhouse gasses, cut down on toxic emissions, reuse and recycle solid waste, control indoor air pollution and reduce the use of dangerous pesticides.

  Online rumors claim U.S. authorities have instituted a 'news blackout' regarding what is described as a 'near catastrophic meltdown' due to flooding at the Ft. Calhoun Nuclear Plant in Nebraska.

  A shocking report prepared by Russia’s Federal Atomic Energy Agency (FAAE) on information provided to them by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) states that the Obama regime has ordered a 'total and complete' news blackout relating to any information regarding the near catastrophic meltdown of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant located in Nebraska.

  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: As of mid-June 2011, steadily rising floodwaters from the Missouri River had surrounded the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant some 19 miles outside Omaha, Nebraska, but both local and federal authorities say the reactor, which was shut down last April, is well protected and in no imminent danger of a meltdown or other catastrophic event. Officials are monitoring it closely.
  Nor is a 'news blackout' in effect. Officials of the Omaha Public Power District have issued frequent statements to the press and posted regular updates on the OPPD Storm and Flood Blog since late May.
  Contrary to reports that Fort Calhoun Station is on 'Level 4 Alert,' as of this writing (June 23) the plant remains under the least serious of the four emergency classifications set by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, namely a 'Notification of Unusual Event' issued June 6 after the Missouri River was projected to reach 1,004 feet above sea level (the elevation of Fort Calhoun).
  According to a statement on the OPPD website, 'The reactor and spent-fuel pool are in a normal, stable condition and are both protected; there has been no release of radioactivity and none is expected.'
  As to reports of a 'no fly zone' instituted over the plant, there has been an FAA-issued NOTAM ('Notice to Airmen') restricting the airspace over all U.S. nuclear plants since September 11, 2001, with a precautionary 'tightening' in the vicinity of Fort Calhoun since June 6. Officials say it has nothing to do with a supposed 'meltdown' or purported release of radioactivity.

  What no one seems quite certain of is who's responsible for it and what the sign is supposed to mean.
  According to the owner of the space, Schubert & Hoey Outdoor Advertising of Minneapolis, the sign was put up by local business owners who wish to remain anonymous. The obvious interpretation is that it's a slap against President Obama and an implicit call for a return to Republican leadership, but some have suggested that the intent may be more ironic, e.g., 'If you think things are bad now, imagine what it would be like if George W.

"G.W. Bush, America's Soul-Saving President","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/Election-2016/fl/Is-Jeb-Bush-Running-for-President-in-2016.htm","Why Jeb Bush's 2016 Presidential Campaign Failed","2014-05-26 15:26:00","  By Tom Murse
  Jeb Bush began the 2016 presidential campaign as an apparent front-runner because of his experience as governor of Florida, his conservative credentials and his vast knowledge of public policy. But Bush's campaign lasted just 251 days. He dropped out after losing the first three Republican presidential primaries and when it became clear that Donald Trump , whose campaign had once been laughed off by other candidates, was a serious candidate.
  Bush's primary obstacle at the outset of the race was believed to have been his name, his part in the Bush political dynasty . He is a brother to former President George W. Bush , whose presidency became more unpopular in his second term because of the protracted war in Iraq, and son of former President George H.W. Bush .
  Jeb Bush launched his 2016 campaign for president on June 15, 2015, by highlighting his experience as governor of a large state. ​'As our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that.
  We are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it.'
  Bush quit his campaign after losing the South Carolina primary to Donald Trump on Feb. 20, 2016. Bush had faced a barrage of insults from Trump at the debate, including one that seemed to sum up his candidacy - being described as 'low energy,' an apparent swipe at his penchant for sticking to policy matters and not being as flamboyant as Trump on the campaign trail.
  “In this campaign I have stood my ground, refusing to bend to the political winds. Despite what you might’ve heard, ideas matter, policy matters. And I truly hope that these ideas that we’ve laid out will serve as a blueprint for a generation of conservative leaders,' Bush said in South Carolina.
  When he was contemplating a run for the White House, Bush told the press: “The decision will be based on ‘Can I do it joyfully,’ because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits.'
  In the end, however, voters weren't looking for someone who was polite and uplifting. They weren't looking for someone with experience or connections to Washington, D.C., insiders. They were angry about the economy and latched onto Trump's ideas about closing off the border, renegotiating trade deals and bringing back jobs from overseas. Bush could not compete with the louder, more brash Trump with his own mild manner and politeness.
  Political journalists, who dubbed Jeb Bush 'the smart Bush,' noted early on the potential candidate's chief dilemma: his last name .
  Wrote The New York Times in May 2014:
  'As Mr. Bush, 61, weighs whether to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, he is dogged by fears of voter exhaustion with a family name indelibly linked to his older brother, a self-assured Texan who prized instinct over expertise and once acknowledged a lack of interest in slogging through long books.'
  Wrote the National Journal 's Josh Kraushaar:
  'As accomplished as Jeb Bush is, the notion that he'd be the party's strongest contender against Clinton is fanciful—and that's if he could even manage to get out of a primary. He hasn't won an election since 2002, he's proven slow to adapt to the new media landscape and navigating the waters between establishment leadership and the tea-party grassroots. Most importantly, his last name carries significant baggage. Given the pervasive anti-insider environment, would voters elect a third member of the same family? As the nominee, he'd protect Clinton from her biggest vulnerabilities.'
  Republican elites were said to be trying to persuade Bush to run as early as 2014. The Washington Post reported in March 2014 that:
  'Many of the Republican Party’s most powerful insiders and financiers have begun a behind-the-scenes campaign to draft former Florida governor Jeb Bush into the 2016 presidential race, courting him and his intimates and starting talks on fundraising strategy.'
  Among the Bush supporters was House Speaker John Boehner, who resigned his post before Bush launched his campaign.
  “We’ve got a lot of good candidates out there. If you look historically, our best candidates have come from the ranks of governors, of former governors, and yes, Jeb Bush is my friend, I think he’d make a great president, and I’ve been nudging him for some time,” Boehner said.
  The Republicans who pushed a Bush candidacy saw the former Florida governor as an alternative to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who was once considered the most popular Republican in the country but whose administration became mired in scandal.
  The scandal, known as Bridgegate , erupted in January 2014, just two months after the New Jersey governor easily won re-election to a second term and amid rampant speculation he was considering a run for president in 2016 .
  The depth of the scandal concerned Republicans.
  Democrats initially relished a Jeb Bush presidential candidacy because of the political baggage his last name carried with it. But they faced the same problem after U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton decided to run and won the nomination. Voters disliked her husband's scandal-plagued second term in the White House and considered her possible election to be third term for Barack Obama.

"G.W. Bush Dubbed 'Walking Eagle' by Native Americans","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_walking_eagle.htm","President Bush Named 'Walking Eagle' by Native Americans?","2016-03-27 14:21:11","  By David Emery
  Description: Viral text / Joke Circulating since: Nov. 2004 (this version) Status:  False (see details below)
  See also: Barack Obama Named 'Walking Eagle' by Native Americans
  2005 example: Forwarded email contributed by Meredith Z., Feb. 8, 2005:
  WALKING EAGLE
  President Bush was invited to address a major gathering of the American Indian Nation last weekend in Arizona. He spoke for almost an hour on his future plans for increasing every Native American's present standard of living. He referred to his career as Governor of Texas, how he had signed 'YES' 1,237 times - for every Indian issue that came to his desk for approval.
  Although the President was vague on the details of his plan, he seemed most enthusiastic about his future ideas for helping his 'red brother'
  At the conclusion of his speech, the Tribes presented the President with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name - Walking Eagle. The proud President then departed in his motorcade, waving to the crowds
  A news reporter later inquired to the group of chiefs of how they come to select the new name given to the President.
  They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of shit it can no longer fly.
  Analysis: My guess is that the reason some folks have reacted to this obvious joke as though it might be true is that the set-up is so wordy and deadpan. The punchline, though funny, is simply false. President Bush has neither attended any American Indian Nation gatherings in recent months, nor has he been christened by tribal elders with the Indian name 'Walking Eagle.'
  One reason we're so sure of this is that a variant of the same joke went around during the 2004 presidential race with Democrat contender Sen. John Kerry as its butt.
  Email example contributed by Joy W., June 23, 2004:
  During a campaign tour of the Apache Nation Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said he had a plan to increase every Native American's income by $40,000 a year. Senator Kerry refused repeated requests for details of his plan, however. He also told the Apaches that during his Senate career, he has voted YES 9,637 for every Indian issue ever introduced.
  Before his departure, the Apache Tribe presented the Presidential candidate a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name, Running Eagle.
  After Kerry left, tribal officials explained that Running Eagle is a bird so full of shit it can't fly.
  You'll note that while Bush was allegedly given the name 'Walking Eagle' in the 2005 version of the joke, Kerry was dubbed 'Running Eagle' in the one above. There's no clear reason for the variation apart from the emergence of a transitional version dated September 2004 in which Kerry's alleged Indian name unaccountably morphs into 'Walking Eagle.'

  HMMMMMMM, Interesting.
  Subject: Bush and John 3:16 Worth thinking about . . . The Lord has a way of revealing those of us who really know him, and those that don't!!!
  Think about it! Bush gave a big speech last week about how his faith is so 'important' to him. In this attempt to convince the American people that we should consider him for president, he announced that his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3.
  Of course the speech writer meant John 3:16, but nobody in the Bush camp was familiar enough with scripture to catch the error. And do you know what John 16:3 says?
  John 16:3 says; 'And they will do this because they have not known the Father nor Me'.
  The Holy Spirit works in strange ways. Pass it on. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!!
  Analysis: What goes around comes around. This embarrassing verbal gaffe was originally attributed to Vice President (and presidential candidate) Al Gore in 1999 and widely disseminated by conservatives, including radio commentator Paul Harvey.
  Gore never said it; neither did President G.W. Bush.
  According to newspaper columnist Cal Thomas, this very mistake was made by G.W. Bush's father, however, during a speech before a religious broadcasters' conference in 1990. Thomas recounts witnessing the incident in his book, Blinded by Might: Can the Religious Right Save America .

  Ashley was described as an easy child who could entertain herself and one who adored being hugged. Basically well-behaved Ashley seemed to live a fairly normal life for a child of parents so young. But then at about the age of nine or ten, Lori Pond divorced David Pond, and Ashley's world changed forever.
  The Truth About Her Biological Father:
  During the divorce the couple fought about child-support payments and a paternity test was administered to determine if Ashley was indeed David Ponds biological daughter. To Ashley’s devastation, it was determined that he was not, but instead a man named Wesley Roettger was her real father.
  She Admits to Being Sexually Abused:
  She began to visit her biological father, staying with him on the weekends. It was during this time that friends and family noticed she was growing increasingly sullen and confrontational. She began to resist visiting her father until finally she admitted to her mother that Wesley Roettger had been sexually abusing her. In January 2001, Roettger was indicted on 40 counts of raping and sexually abusing Ashley over a time span of four years. He pled no contest to one count and was released.
  Ward Weaver Enters Her World:
  During the following months, the police were called out to the Pond apartment for various reasons including an allegation that Pond was drunk and neglecting the children. By April 2001, Ashley Pond was spending a lot of time over at the house of a friend, who was the daughter of Ward Weaver. In early spring, a report was made by Linda Virden, Ashley's reading teacher, to Gaffney Lane Elementary principal Chris Mills, that she saw Ward Weaver kiss Ashley on the lips.
  She Finds Comfort at the Weaver Home:
  According to the Portland Tribune, Ashley spent almost the first half of 2001 with the Weaver family even joining Ward Weaver, his girlfriend and Weaver's daughter on a two-week vacation to California in late June, early July. The calls to the police about disturbances at the Pond's home continued over the next few months and Ashley spent more and more time with the Weavers.
  Weaver is Accused of Sexually Abusing Her:
  In early August, Ashley confided in her reading teacher, Linda Virden, that Ward Weaver was molesting her and threatened to testify against her in father's rape trial. Earlier in April she also accused two other men of molesting her, but recanted her statements. Possibly the fear of no one believing her kept her from pursuing charges against Weaver.
  Paperwork Slips Through the Cracks:
  Once the accusations were made, she stopped going to Weaver's house and felt ostracized by Weaver, Weaver's daughter, and friends of Weaver's daughter. Due to the sloppy handling of the paperwork by county officials regarding Ashley's accusation, Weaver was never investigated or charged for sexually abusing Ashley at that time.
  Life Begins to Settle Down:
  Throughout the following fall, Ashley's life seemed to settle down. Her grades were improving and she was fighting less with her mother. Some of her bubbly personality seemed to return. As Christmas approached it has been suggested that Ashley and the Weaver's had partially renewed their friendship.
  Ashley Pond is Murdered:
  According to the Portland Tribune, On Jan 9, 2002, Lori Pond heard Ashley say goodbye around 8:15 a.m. as she headed out to catch her school bus at a stop near Weaver’s home. What happened to Ashley after that time is unknown. What is known is that at some point before she died, she consumed possibly as much as five shots of whiskey.
  On the weekend of August 24-25, the body of Ashley Pond was found inside a barrel buried in a hole in the backyard of Ward Weaver's rental home. A concrete slab had been poured over the hole. According to Weaver's son, Francis Weaver, his father confessed to him that he killed Ashley Pond, although the exact details of the confession have changed from time to time.
  On October 4, 2002 Ward Weaver was indicted for the murder of Ashley Pond and of 16 other counts including sex abuse, attempted rape, aggravated murder and abuse of a corpse all of which he plead not guilty.
  On September 22, 2004 Ward Weaver plead guilty to killing two of his daughter's friends then hiding their bodies on his property. He received two life sentences for the deaths of Ashley Pond and Miranda Gaddis.

"On G.W. Bush's IQ (or Lack Thereof)","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bliq-bush.htm","On G.W. Bush's IQ (or Lack Thereof)","2016-02-20 19:01:43","  By David Emery
  Description: Email hoax / Satire Circulating since: July 2001 Status:  False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Jason M., July 16, 2001:
  Report: President Bush Has Lowest IQ of All Presidents of Past 50 Years
  If late night TV comedy is an indicator, then there has never been as widespread a perception that a president is not intellectually qualified for the position he holds as there is with President GW Bush.
  In a report published Monday, the Lovenstein Institute of Scranton, Pennsylvania, detailed its findings of a four-month study of the intelligence quotient of President George W. Bush.
  Since 1973, the Lovenstein Institute has published its research to the education community on each new president, which includes the famous 'IQ' report among others.
  According to statements in the report, there have been twelve presidents over the past 50 years, from F. D. Roosevelt to G. W. Bush who were all rated based on scholarly achievements, writings that they alone produced without aid of staff, their ability to speak with clarity, and several other psychological factors which were then scored in the Swanson/Crain system of intelligence ranking.
  The study determined the following IQs of each president as accurate to within five percentage points:
  147 Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) 132 Harry Truman (D) 122 Dwight D. Eisenhower (R) 174 John F. Kennedy (D) 126 Lyndon B. Johnson (D) 155 Richard M. Nixon (R) 121 Gerald Ford (R) 175 James E. Carter (D) 105 Ronald Reagan (R) 098 George HW Bush (R) 182 William J. Clinton (D) 091 George W. Bush (R)
  The six Republican presidents of the past 50 years had an average IQ of 115.5, with President Nixon having the highest IQ, at 155.
  President G. W. Bush was rated the lowest of all the Republicans with an IQ of 91. The six Democrat presidents had IQs with an average of 156, with President Clinton having the highest IQ, at 182. President Lyndon B. Johnson was rated the lowest of all the Democrats with an IQ of 126.
  No president other than Carter (D) has released his actual IQ, 176.
  Among comments made concerning the specific testing of President G. W. Bush, his low ratings were due to his apparent difficulty to command the English language in public statements, his limited use of vocabulary (6,500 words for Bush versus an average of 11,000 words for other presidents), his lack of scholarly achievements other than a basic MBA, and an absence of any body of work which could be studied on an intellectual basis. The complete report documents the methods and procedures used to arrive at these ratings, including depth of sentence structure and voice stress confidence analysis.
  'All the Presidents prior to George W. Bush had a least one book under their belt, and most had written several white papers during their education or early careers. Not so with President Bush,' Dr. Lovenstein said. 'He has no published works or writings, so in many ways that made it more difficult to arrive at an assessment. We had to rely more heavily on transcripts of his unscripted public speaking.'
  The Lovenstein Institute of Scranton, Pennsylvania, think-tank includes high-caliber historians, psychiatrists, sociologists, scientists in human behavior, and psychologists. Among their ranks are Dr. Werner R. Lovenstein, world-renowned sociologist, and Professor Patricia F. Dilliams, a world-respected psychiatrist.
  This study was commissioned on February 13, 2001, and released on July 9, 2001, to subscribing member universities and organizations within the education community.
  Analysis: You'd think Americans would have grown weary of 'Bush is an idiot' jokes by now (Aug. 2001), but the popularity of this forwarded email suggests otherwise. It's obviously a work of satire. Even so, the text has frequently enough been cited as factual to generate heated, though undeserved, debate.
  I've found no evidence of the existence of a 'Lovenstein Institute' in Scranton, Pennsylvania or anywhere else. (UPDATE: Yes, I know there's a website purporting to be that of a real-life 'Lovenstein Institute,' but it was created well after the Bush IQ email first began circulating, and is equally bogus ). There is no trace to be found of a 'Dr. Werner R. Lovenstein, world-renowned sociologist' or 'Professor Patricia F. Dilliams, world-respected psychiatrist'  not in this world, at any rate. Every fact and figure in the message appears to have been fabricated. Some versions claim the text was originally published by the Associated Press, which is not the case.
  The true source of this work of fiction was www.linkydinky.com , which is home, appropriately enough, to a humor mailing list.
  Take the Poll : 'Would you be surprised to learn that G.W. Bush has a lower IQ than previous presidents?'

"G.W. Bush Nigerian Scam Parody","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/wariniraq/i/iraq_overview.htm","War in Iraq","2004-09-30 07:29:37","  The US Congress passed a resolution in October 2002 that authorized military force to enforce UN sanctions and 'defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.' On 20 March 2003, the United States launched a war against Iraq, with President Bush saying the attack was to 'disarm Iraq and to free its people'; 250,000 United States troops were supported by approximately 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces.
  The US State Department released this list of the 'coalition of the willing': Afghanistan, Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan and the United States.
  On 1 May, aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln and under a 'Mission Accomplished' banner, the President said, 'Major combat operations have ended; in the battle of iraq, the US and her allies have prevailed... We've removed an ally of al Qaida.' Fighting continues; there is no scheduled departure of US troops. The Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) assumed authority for governing Iraq on June 28, 2004. Elections are scheduled for January 2005. Whereas the first Gulf War was measured in days, this second has been measured in months. Fewer than 200 US military were killed in the first war; more than 1,000 have been killed in the second. Congress has appropriated $151 billion for the war effort.
  Latest Developments
  A review of US and coalition troops (June 2005). US Liberals reports on Iraq by the Numbers (July 2005).
  Background
  Iraq is approximately the size of California with a population of 24 million; it is bordered by Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Ethnnically, the country is predominantly Arab (75-80%) and Kurd (15-20%).
  Religious composition is estimated at Shi'a Muslim 60%, Sunni Muslim 32%-37%, Christian 3%, and Yezidi less than 1%. Once known as Mesopotamia, Iraq was part of the Ottoman Empire and became a British territory after World War I. It achieved independence in 1932 as a constitutional monarchy and joined the United Nations in 1945. In the '50s and '60s, the country's government was marked by repeated coups. Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq and Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council in July 1979. From 1980-88, Iraq warred with its larger neighbor, Iran. The United States supported Iraq in this conflict. On July 17, 1990, Hussein accused Kuwait -- which it had never accepted as a separate entity -- of flooding the world oil market and 'stealing oil' from field which ran beneath both countries. On August 2, 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded and occupied Kuwait.' The US led a UN coalition in February 1991, forcing Iraq to exit Kuwait. Coalition Allied Forces, 34 countries, included Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Honduras, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, The Netherlands, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Syria, Turkey, The United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. President Bush rejected calls to march to Baghdad and oust Hussein. The U.S. Department of Defense estimated the cost of the war as $61.1 billion; others suggested the cost could be as high as $71 billion. Much of the cost was borne by others: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States pledged $36 billion; Germany and Japan, $16 billion.
  Pros
  In his 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush asserted that Hussein aided al Qaida; Vice President Cheney elaborated that Hussein had provided 'training to al-Qaeda members in the areas of poisons, gases, making conventional bombs.' In addition, the President said that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and that there was a real and present danger that he could launch a strike on the US or provide terrorists with WMD.
  In a speech in October 2002 in Cincinnati, he said that Hussein '... could bring sudden terror and suffering to America... a significant danger to America... Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints....
  we're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using unmanned aerial vehicles for missions targeting the United States... America must not ignore the threat gathering against us.' In January 2003, the President said, 'With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region... The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages... The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N.
  Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world.' This epitomizes the 'Bush Doctrine' of pre-emptive war. When it became obvious that the UN would not endorses the US military proposal, the US tabled the war referendum.
  Cons
  The 9-11 Commission report made it clear that there was no collaboration between Hussein and al Qaida.
  No weapons of mass destruction have been found in the 18 months that the US has been inside Iraq. There are no nuclear or biological weapons. All appear to have been destroyed during the Gulf War (Desert Storm). Instead, the status of weapons more closely matches that of Administration claims in 2001:
  Where It Stands
  The Administration now justifies the war based on Hussein's human rights record. Public opinion polls suggest that most Americans no longer believe this war was a good idea; this is a major change from March 2003 when an overwhelming majority supported the war. However, dislike of the war has not translated to a dislike of the President; the contest between President Bush and Senator Kerry remains neck-and-neck.

  Mitt Romney is not running for president in 2016.
  The former Massachusetts governor and failed 2012 Republican nominee ended mounting speculation about a third run for the White House in early 2015 by saying he wanted to give other members of his party a chance to seek the nomination .
  Related Story: Date of the 2016 Presidential Election
  Romney took his name out of consideration but qualified his decision by saying he was convinced he would have won the GOP presidential nod and could have had the 'best chance of beating the eventual Democrat nominee,' whom many speculated would likely be former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
  Romney told supporters in a Jan. 30 teleconference :
  'You know that I have wanted to be that president. But I do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president. You can’t imagine how hard it is for Ann and me to step aside, especially knowing of your support and the support of so many people across the country. But we believe it is for the best of the Party and the nation.'

  Profile of Mitt Romney
  Romney's decision was among the earliest markers of the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign and cleared the path for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to emerge as one of two favorites among moderates and party elites. The other was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie .
  Related Story: 5 Republicans Who Support Jeb Bush for President in 2016
  Bush was among the first politicians to respond to Romney's announcement. 'I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing America's promise through upward mobility, encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense,' Bush said.
  Romney experienced a fleeting moment of popularity in 2014 but many big-time Republican donors changed course by late in the year when Bush made it clear he was seriously considering a run for the White House.
  Perhaps one of the clearest signals the Romney was being overshadowed by Bush was the defection of a key campaign strategist for Romney in 2012 and 2008, David Kochel, to a political action committee assembled by Bush ahead of 2016.
  Related Story: What is a Country Club Republican?
  Two of the obstacles Romney could not overcome were his failed attempted to run for president in 2008 and 2012. He lost the primary battle to U.S. Sen. John McCain in 2008 and, after winning the nomination in 2012, lost handily to incumbent President Barack Obama in the 2012 election .
  Losing an election, of course, is not the kiss of death. There have been eight losing presidential candidates who actually came back from defeat to win a major-party presidential nomination a second time. Of those, four – half of them – won the race for the White House, including Richard Nixon.
  For Romney, though, the overwhelming 2012 defeat was too much to overcome.
  Romney's departure as a candidate from the 2016 campaign certainly did not mean he had vanished from the political scene. Romney's endorsement will play a significant role in determining which Republican will capture the nomination.

  So, too, will the super PAC that supported his presidency . It will no doubt spend money supporting the candidate Romney decides to endorse. That committee, Restore Our Future Inc., is a super PAC that raised $142 million in 2011 to support Romney.

  Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was widely considered to be the front-runner in the earliest stages of the 2016 presidential race . He entered the race after being courted by some pretty big names in the Republican Party. The younger brother to former President George W. Bush and son of former President George H.W. Bush won support from many establishment Republicans, or the mainstream and more well heeled members of the party.
  But he dropped out of the race in February of 2016, after losing the first three primaries and when it became clear Donald Trump, the unlikeliest of presidential aspirants, was winning support with a strong nationalist message that appealed to disaffected working class voters in middle America. 'I fully believe the American people must entrust this office to someone who believes whoever holds it is a servant, not the master,' Bush said in announcing his decision.
  Bush later endorsed Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz for the nomination.
  So who thought Bush was going to win in 2016?
  Here's a look at five big-name Republicans who supported Bush in one way or another, whether they are members of Congress or wealthy donors, and whether they are supporting Bush directly or indirectly.
  The former House speaker known for his battles with the conservative Tea Party wing of the GOP was vocal in support of a Bush candidacy. He went on record as encouraging Bush to run for president in 2016 as early as May 2014.
  “We’ve got a lot of good candidates out there, and yes, Jeb Bush is my friend, I think he’d make a great president. And I’ve been nudging him for some time,” Boehner said.
  The multibillionaire businessman and prolific contributor to Republican candidates hadn't been quoted on the record as supporting Jeb Bush for president. But Adelson, who is very influential in Republican Party politics, threw at least one VIP dinner for Bush.
  That dinner, according to The Washington Post , kicked off a four-day leadership conference held by the Republican Jewish Coalition. According to an account of the event in The Post , the roughly 60 dinner invitees 'bust into applause' when one donor told Bush: “I hope you run for president in 2016.”
  The Post also said Bush met privately with Adelson, though the two did not reportedly talk about the 2016 presidential campaign.
  This, of course, is a no-brainer. Families stick together, especially in politics, so it would be big news of former President George W. Bush didn't publicly support his brother.
  The 41st president of the United States said at a February 2016 rally for his brother:
  “Jeb is man of deep and humble faith that reveals itself through good works, not loud words. I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated. But we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our frustration.”
  The former adviser to former President George W. Bush told BuzzFeed in April 2014 that members of his party would be foolish not to recruit Jeb Bush to run for president in 2016.
  “We have a responsibility to make sure Jeb runs,” he said. “If Jeb Bush does not run, shame on us. I would work in a Jeb administration in a heartbeat.”
  The MSNBC talk show host and former member of Congress described Bush as a skilled politician and leader, but wasn't necessarily convinced that he could win the White House.
  'He was a great governor and I think he'd be a great candidate, but there's an awful lot of questions about whether Americans want another Bush,' Scarborough has said.
  The Morning Joe host has also said: 'I love Jeb. I'd be thrilled if Jeb were running. But I'm telling you, there's not the excitement out there.'
  Scarborough was later critical of Bush's campaign, particularly of the candidate's attempts to play to the crowds at his rallies, which the TV host said were clearly not genuine.
  'He’s got to start each speech by saying, ‘You know what, I’m a dork. I’ll admit it. You may not want me to hang out with you over the weekend if you and your friends are drinking beer and watching TV because I’m going to slip off to my laptop and I’m going to be trying and figure out how to clean the mess up and it’s who I am. I’m a dork. I’m boring. I am not exciting,'” Scarborough said.

"Gold Star Mothers vs. Hillary Clinton","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/2016elections/fl/2016-Democratic-Presidential-Power-Rankings.htm","5 Reasons Hillary Clinton Will Run for President... and Lose","2014-06-11 23:42:31","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Hillary Clinton could become the first female President of the United States. That reality alone has been the primary driver of Hillary's political existence. She rode her husbands coattails all the way to the US Senate. She ran in New York, of course, because the long-time Arkansan would be given a clear path to victory there. This would then set the stage for the obvious plan that the Clinton's had to continue the dynasty and return to the White House. In 2008, Hillary was the inevitable Democratic candidate. She lost, of course, but she is once again the inevitable candidate heading into 2016. Many think she will coast to victory as the chance for yet another new 'first' will over-ride all other concerns. Sadly, they might be right. But here are five reasons why they are probably, or at least hopefully, wrong.
  1: People like the Idea of Hillary Clinton More than the Actually Like Hillary Clinton
  Any realistic analysis of polls over the last 25 years or so points to one reality: People really just like the idea of Hillary Clinton, and not so much the person who winds up in front of them at the end of the day?
  continue reading below our video
  Profile of Hillary Clinton
  She could break the 'glass ceiling' at the White House. She has the Clinton name, even if she reluctantly changed it from Hillary Rodham to appease the more socially conservative tyes in Arkansas. Her resume shows she has the experience, pointing to her time as a First Lady, US Senator, and Secretary of State. She is often quite popular, but usually only when she hasn't been heard of for months at a time. Once she sticks her head out of the sand he number quickly start to drop.
  When Hillary was pushing socialized medicine as First Lady in the early 90s she wasn't very popular. Once she backed away from pushing her healthcare agenda and the Clinton Administration went moderate she regained her political footing and scored in the 60% favorable range. She was overwhelmingly popular until she ran for US Senate in 2001 and became a political monster once again, where she quickly fell underwater in popularity once again. As a US Senator and constant Bush nemesis, she had middling numbers throughout most of her time as Senator. That lasted until 2006 when the next presidential election was getting serious consideration and the 'chatter' about possibly having the first female President boosted her numbers north of 50% in most polls. And then she announced her intentions in 2007, started campaigning, and she fell to break-even at best and, more often than not, slightly underwater once people got a feel for her once again.
  When she jumped to the State Department under President Obama, her numbers soared into the mid-60s as no-one heard from her for months at a time and she was once again the 'ideal' candidate. She was also, once again, the inevitable first female POTUS. High approvals ratings followed her State Department tenure and first 2 years of 'retirement' as people continued to not see much of her. Then in 2014 she re-emerged to defend her questionable State record and she launched a ho-hum book as part of her re-introduction to the public. According to Gallup tracking , she would fall from 64% favorable in 2013 to 59% by February 2014 and then to 54% by June. Notice that every low point on the Gallup bar graph is when Hillary is most visible and her high points are when she has seemingly disappeared. Conclusion: People like the idea of Hillary more than Hillary herself. Perhaps if she could make it to election day without having to make a public appearance she would win in a landslide.
  2: She is a Woman Without a Philosophy
  Who is Hillary Clinton and who really knows what she believes? That's the problem Hillary will have once again in 2016. In 2008, she ran as a 'moderate' in her primary thinking the nomination was going to be hers. She lost to Barack Obama who ran clearly to her left. How will she appease progressives in 2016 and how will it hurt her moderate positioning? Can she tip-toe around Obamacare and the economic mess she would inherit should she win? She likes to leave much up to the imagination when it comes to her philosophy. This can be a problem when it enables others to define her better than she defines herself. She my also mistakenly think that she can win by running as a far lefty since Barack did, but he did not win because of his liberal ideas. (See #3 and #5 as to what Obama offered that she does not.)
  3: She is Not New
  For a party that prides itself on being young and fresh and hip, the Democrats have a 'freshness' deficit on their hands when compared to Republicans. Hillary has been around for almost three decades now and that doesn't exactly bring excitement. Hot on her heals is Joe Biden, who was first elected to the US Senate when Richard Nixon was President. The potential of electing the first female POTUS lost out to the freshness and newness of Barack Obama. Unless the GOP runs off and nominates someone like Jeb Bush, the party will undoubtedly have the fresher, younger, more exciting candidate.
  4: She is Accomplishment Free
  There are few things more entertaining in life than asking a Hillary Clinton supporter to name an accomplishment. Sure, Barack Obama had few accomplishments under his belt before becoming President. Heck, he once claimed that running his large campaign team was an accomplishment and that living in Indonesia as a kid qualified as solid foreign policy experience. But he also hadn't been a national figure for more than two decades. He certainly didn't have the resume Hillary has and, yet, nothing. Her main policy goal as First Lady was a disaster. She had nothing to show for in eight years as a US Senator. And her time as Secretary of State was mostly just failure on top of disappointment.
  5: Hillary is Actually Quite Dull
  Here is Hillary's real problem: She is dull. Like, a knife made out of butter dull. We can all admit that Mitt Romney was quite a dull candidate for the Republicans. Al Gore was famously wooden, too. But Hillary just may break the glass ceiling on dullness. Every move is calculated. There is little spontaneity. This was a huge reason Barack Obama was able to sneak in and topple the chosen one. Barack was - to liberals at least - exciting. He was new, and fresh, and different. In the age of social media, dullness doesn't sell well. When was the last time someone talked about a rousing speak by Clinton? Marco Rubio gives them all the time. Rand Paul is specifically targeting the Democrats demographics. Ben Carson took the stage at a National Prayer Breakfast and insulted the President's policies as he sat just feet away. Dull doesn't get people to turn the television on, as was evident when few tuned in to see her first big prime-time interview to launch her new book.
  This isn't to say Hillary Clinton can't win. That would be stupid. But she isn't a Barack Obama and she probably isn't a lot of the Republican class of 2010, either. In the end, voters might ask for more than simply being able to check off the gender box for President. Obama offered a lot of reasons for a lot of people to vote for him in 2008. What else does Hillary have to offer?

"Harvey Milk Day","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/harvey_milk_day.htm","Harvey Milk Day","2008-09-20 01:36:53","  By David Emery
  Forwarded email urges California residents to call the governor and voice their objections to AB 2567, a legislative bill designating May 22 as Harvey Milk Day to commemorate the San Francisco city supervisor slain in 1978.
  Description: Email flier Circulating since: Sep. 2008 Status: True
  Email example contributed by NGJ, Sep. 19, 2008:
  Subject: : AB 2567
  I just called, this is true! (The Number to call is: 1 916-445-2841) It took 4 'redial' calls to get through. Then key in 1, then 2, then 1, then 2 for a NO vote.
  Please take a moment to voice your NO vote! Just one more reason to move from wacky CA. I have nothing against gays and believe they shouldn't be discriminated against but to have a gay day in elementary schools is going too far.
  Dear Friends: This is an issue that is pretty much going under the radar, and I think we all need to make this telephone call.
  This is real. It took less than 30 seconds. It is just a recording and pressing 2 to say NO. Please read it!!!
  AB 2567 has passed the California Assembly and the Senate and is awaiting Governor Schwarzenegger' s signature or veto. This bill will set aside May 22nd as a special day to celebrate the life of homosexual politician Harvey Milk in the public schools. Harvey Milk will be honored in the same manner as our Founding Fathers and Martin Luther King, although the only thing he is actually known for is being proud be be a homosexual! If you haven't heard about this bill it is because the liberal media is downplaying this bill so that it will pass.
  PLEASE CALL GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND MAKE YOU VOICE HEARD.
  The Number to call is: 1 916-445-2841
  Please forward this to as many people as possible.

  Comments: True. California Assembly Bill 2567 ( full text ) calls for the governor to proclaim May 22 'Harvey Milk Day' in honor of the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in a major U.S. city, Harvey Milk .
  Introduced by state assemblyman Mark Leno in February 2008, AB 2567 was passed by the legislature in August and sent to the governor's office for signing in mid-September. As of this writing Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has neither authorized nor vetoed the bill, nor made any public statements for or against it.
  Contrary to the impression given in the message above, AB 2567 would not create an official holiday comparable to Martin Luther King Day or Presidents Day. Rather, to quote the bill's first paragraph, it would designate May 22 as having 'special significance in public schools and educational institutions and would encourage those entities to conduct suitable commemorative exercises on that date.' (See excerpt below for more details.)
  Note, too, that the new law would encourage public schools to recognize Harvey Milk Day, not require it.
  Lastly, the phone number provided above is correct. To contact Governor Arnold Shwarzenegger and voice your opinion on AB 2567, dial 1-916-445-2841.
  Excerpt from AB 2567:
  (1) The second Wednesday in May as the Day of the Teacher. (2) April 21 of each year as John Muir Day. (3) April 6 of each year as California Poppy Day. (4) May 22 of each year as Harvey Milk Day.
  (b) On each of the days designated in subdivision (a), all public schools and educational institutions are encouraged to observe those days and to conduct suitable commemorative exercises as follows:
  (1) On the Day of the Teacher, exercises commemorating and directing attention to teachers and the teaching profession.
  (2) On John Muir Day, exercises stressing the importance that an ecologically sound natural environment plays in the quality of life for all of us, and emphasizing John Muir's significant contributions to the fostering of that awareness and the indelible mark he left on the State of California.
  (3) On California Poppy Day, exercises honoring the California Poppy, including instruction about native plants, particularly the California Poppy, and the economic and aesthetic value of wildflowers; promoting responsible behavior toward our natural resources and a spirit of protection toward them; and emphasizing the value of natural resources and conservation of natural resources.
  (4) On Harvey Milk Day, exercises remembering the life of Harvey Milk and recognizing his accomplishments as well as the contributions he made to this state.
  (c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the exercises encouraged in this section be integrated into the regular school program, and be conducted by the school or institution within the amount otherwise budgeted for educational programs.

"Health Care Real Estate Tax","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/Health-Care-Real-Estate-Tax.htm","Sales Tax - The Economics of Sales Taxes","2009-06-11 14:15:35","  By Mike Moffatt
  Sales Tax - What Is It?:
  The Glossary of Economics Terms defines a sales tax as a 'tax levied on the sale of a good or service, which is usually proportional to the price of the good or service sold.'
  The Two Types of Sales Taxes:
  Sales taxes come in two varieties. The first is a consumption tax or retail sales tax which is a straight percentage tax placed on the sale of a good. These are the traditional type of sales tax. The second type of sales tax is a value added tax . On a value added tax (VAT), the net tax amount is the difference between the input costs and the sales price. If a retailer pays $30 for a good from a wholesaler and charges the customer $40, then the net tax is only placed on the $10 difference. VATs are used in Canada (GST), Australia (GST) and all member countries of the European Union (EU VAT).
  Sales Tax - What Advantages Do Sales Taxes Have?:
  The biggest advantage to sales taxes are how economically efficient they are in collecting a single dollar of revenue for the government - that is, they have the smallest negative impact on the economy per dollar collected.
  continue reading below our video
  Test Your General Science Knowledge
  Sales Tax - Evidence of Advantages:
  In an article about taxation in Canada a 2002 Fraser Institute study was cited on the 'marginal efficiency cost' of various taxes in Canada. They found that per dollar collected, corporate income taxes did $1.55 in damage to the economy. Income taxes were somewhat more efficient in only doing $0.56 worth of damage per dollar collected. Sales taxes, however, came out on top with only $0.17 in economic damage per dollar collected.
  Sales Taxes - What Disadvantages Does A Sales Tax Have?:
  The biggest drawback to sales taxes, in the eyes of many, are that they are a regressive tax - A tax on income in which the proportion of tax paid relative to income decreases as income increases. In Are Sales Taxes More Regressive Than Income Taxes? we saw that the regressivity problem can be overcome, if desired, through the use of rebate cheques and tax exemptions on necessities. The Canadian GST uses both of these mechanisms to reduce the regressivity tax.
  The FairTax Sales Tax Proposal:
  Due to the advantages inherent in using sales taxes, it is not surprising that some believe that the United States should base their entire tax system on sales taxes rather than income taxes. The FairTax , if implemented would replace most U.S. taxes with a national sales tax at a 23-percent tax inclusive (equivalent to a 30-percent tax exclusive) rate. Families would also be issued 'prebate' cheques as to eliminate the inherent regressivity of a sales tax system.

  Analysis: All of the above words were indeed spoken publicly by former first lady, U.S. Senator, Democratic presidential candidate, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
  As presented here, however, they've been stripped of their original context, edited with bias, and generally misrepresented in an attempt to forge the case that Clinton holds ' Marxist ' views.
  Is Hillary Clinton in fact a closet Commie? Read her remarks in their original contexts below and judge for yourself.
  QUOTE: 'We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.' The occasion was a June 28, 2004 fundraiser for Senator Barbara Boxer in San Francisco. Standing before an audience of wealthy Democrats, Clinton criticized the Bush administration's tax cuts for upper-income Americans:
  QUOTE: 'It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few..... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity.' Taken from a speech given in Manchester, New Hampshire on May 29, 2007, outlining what Clinton called her 'progressive vision to aid the middle class [and] address rising income inequality.' Here are her exact words, in context:
  QUOTE: '(We) ....can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people.' QUOTE: 'We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground.' Both of the above passages were taken from the Sojourners Political Forum broadcast on CNN's 'The Situation Room' on June 4, 2007.
  Addressing the difficulty of reaching a political consensus on issues such as health insurance reform and climate change, Clinton stressed the need to compromise for the common good:
  QUOTE: 'I certainly think the free-market has failed.' During the same CNN forum, Clinton was asked what could be done to reduce the frequency of abortion in the United States . She began by speaking of the necessity of assisting young people in making the right choices:
  QUOTE: 'I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched.' Speaking to an audience in Syracuse, New York on September 2, 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Hillary Clinton accused the big oil companies of profiteering — 'trying to make money off the backs of this tragedy' — as gasoline prices shot through the roof.
  She called for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission:

  Recently this week, UK removed The Holocaust from its school curriculum because it 'offended' the Moslem population which claims it never occurred. This is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world and how easily each country is giving into it.
  It is now more than 60 years after the Second World War in Europe ended. This e-mail is being sent as a memorial chain, in memory of the six million Jews, 20 million Russians, 10 million Christians and 1,900 Catholic priests who were murdered, massacred, raped, burned, starved and humiliated with the German and Russia peoples looking the other way!
  Now, more than ever, with Iran, among others, claiming the Holocaust to be 'a myth,' it is imperative to make sure the world never forgets

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: Let me begin by throwing cold water on the claim that the United Kingdom 'banned' or 'removed' references to the Holocaust from its school curriculum. That's false, albeit inspired by April 2007 news coverage of a government-funded study which found that a small number of British schools and some individual teachers admitted to avoiding the presentation of 'emotive' subject matter such as the Holocaust to their students for fear of giving offense to Muslims or otherwise generating controversy.
  Officials: Holocaust teaching still required in British schools
  Fuzzy statistics
  The message purports to memorialize 'six million Jews, 20 million Russians, 10 million Christians and 1,900 Catholic priests who were murdered, massacred, raped, burned, starved and humiliated with the German and Russia peoples looking the other way' — all under the rubric of 'the Holocaust.' As the term is traditionally applied, however, Holocaust refers specifically to the fate of the six million European Jews who died as a result of the genocidal policies of the Nazis.
  It's unclear where, precisely, the rest of those statistics came from and what they're supposed to refer to. 'Twenty million Russians' presumably represents the number of Soviet citizens who died as a result of famine and repression under the rule of communist dictator Joseph Stalin, the brutality of whose regime was comparable to that of the Nazis (though its victims are not usually included among victims of the Holocaust). Historians disagree on the exact number of deaths Stalin was responsible for, but 20 million is not an unreasonable estimate.
  I don't know who the '10 million Christians' are supposed to be. Several times that many Christians died during World War II, of course, but not directly as a result of persecution or genocide. If it doesn't refer to Christian war dead, could the figure be meant to reflect a subset of Stalin's 20 million victims? Your guess is as good as mine.
  As for the '1,900 Catholic priests' cited, I was unable to find a reference confirming this exact number, but it is well known that the Nazis persecuted Roman Catholics, particularly in Poland, killing or imprisoning hundreds of clergymen. Perhaps the exact total was 1,900.
  Falsehoods obscure and trivialize the message
  In any case, though it's true that Holocaust denial is still very much with us and especially rife in the Muslim world today (see the statements of Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad), folks who are truly serious about keeping the memory of this deplorable moment in human history alive would do well to eschew participating in this self-styled 'memorial chain letter,' if for no other reason than that it obscures and trivializes the very message it's supposed to convey.
  Update: A new version of this rumor compounds these falsehoods by misinterpreting the abbreviation 'U.K.' and claiming the teaching of Holocaust history has been banned at the University of Kentucky. Read more...

  Hobby Lobby May Close All 500+ Stores in 41 States
  September 5, 2013
  By David Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.
  When my family and I started our company 40 years ago, we were working out of a garage on a $600 bank loan, assembling miniature picture frames. Our first retail store wasn’t much bigger than most people’s living rooms, but we had faith that we would succeed if we lived and worked according to God’s word. From there, Hobby Lobby has become one of the  nation’s largest arts and crafts retailers, with more than 500 locations in 41 states. Our children grew up into fine business leaders, and today we run Hobby Lobby together, as a family.
  We’re Christians, and we run our business on Christian principles. I’ve always said that the first two goals of our business are (1) to run our business in harmony with God’s laws, and (2) to focus on people more than money. And that’s what we’ve tried to do. We close early so our employees can see their families at night. We keep our stores closed on Sundays, one of the week’s biggest shopping days, so that our workers and their families can enjoy a day of rest.
  We believe that it is by God’s grace that Hobby Lobby has endured, and he has blessed us and our employees. We’ve not only added jobs in a weak economy, we’ve raised wages for the past four years in a row. Our full-time employees start at  80% above minimum wage. But now, our government threatens to change all of that.
  A new government healthcare mandate says that our family business MUST provide what I believe are abortion-causing drugs as part of our health insurance. Being Christians, we don’t pay for drugs that might cause abortions, which means that we don’t cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs.
  - Full Text -
  Analysis: The open letter excerpted above was indeed written by David Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby , a family-owned chain of arts and crafts supply stores with more than 500 locations headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
  Its purpose was to rally public support for the company's religious-based legal challenge against a provision of Obamacare requiring employer-provided health insurance plans to cover emergency contraception.
  As originally written , however, Mr. Green's letter makes no mention of closing any Hobby Lobby locations. It acquired its misinformative title when it was republished a year later on the political blog Tom O'Halloran.com. It has been reposted many, many times since and is still circulating under that misleading headline . Why? Because it gets people riled up.
  The fact is, at no time has any representative of Hobby Lobby suggested that stores may be closed in connection with the Obamacare lawsuit. To the contrary, the company has sought to rebut such rumors by announcing that it would open dozens of new locations in 2014 and 2015.
  See the resources below for more information on the Hobby Lobby lawsuit.

  U.S. governor salaries range from as little as $70,000 and as much as $191,000, and that's not including the lavish perks such as free lifetime healthcare and access to taxpayer-owned vehicles and jets many receive for their work as their state's top executive.
  Related Story: What Do Politicians Really Make?
  A couple of notes about the following information on U.S. governor salaries, however: Not all governors actually take home that amount of money. Some governors voluntarily take pay reductions or return part or all of their salaries to the state treasuries. And, in many states, governors aren't the highest-paid public officials.
  Governors are not able to set their own salaries. Instead, states legislatures or independent salary commissions set the salaries for governors. Most governors are also eligible for automatic pay raises every year, or cost-of-living adjustments that are based on inflation.

  Subject: 28th Amendment!
  For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea that Congress members could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they didn't pay into Social Security, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment ) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered...in all of its forms. Somehow, that doesn't seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law. I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop.
  This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come. Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
  'Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States'.

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  Analysis: While the idea of a 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution may indeed be one 'whose time has come,' and there's some historical truth to the claim that Congress has sometimes exempted itself from laws that apply to the rest of us, the argument outlined above is largely based on inaccurate and outdated information.
  Ever since the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act in 1995 Congress has been answerable to the same civil rights and equal employment regulations that pertain to private businesses. Further alleged disparities, such as those having to do with Congressional retirement provisions and health care coverage, are misrepresented above as well. We'll consider the issues one by one.
  It's false that members of Congress can retire after only one term with full pay, and false that they don't pay into Social Security. Members elected after 1983 participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System. Members elected before 1983 participate in the older Civil Service Retirement Program. In both cases, they contribute to the plans at a slightly higher rate than ordinary federal employees. How much members of Congress receive upon retirement depends on their age, length of government service, and the configuration of their plan. All members of Congress pay into Social Security.
  Once upon a time, members of Congress were exempt from many of the employment and civil rights regulations under which private businesses operate, but no longer, thanks to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 . Section 201 includes prohibitions against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as well as sexual and other harassment in the workplace.
  It's false that Congress exempted itself from the provisions of the various health care reform bills introduced in the House and Senate in 2009. According to an analysis by FactCheck.org: 'Members of Congress are subject to the legislation’s mandate to have insurance, and the plans available to them must meet the same minimum benefit standards that other insurance plans will have to meet.'
  (Update: Per a new regulation proposed in August 2013, the federal government would continue to subsidize the premiums of members of Congress and their staffers after they switch to health insurance plans purchased via the ACA exchange.)

  Description: Forwarded email Circulating since: Aug. 2009 Status: Mostly false
  Email example contributed by Dick B., Nov. 22, 2009:
  Analysis: This much is true: Last year the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 , known colloquially as the 'Cap and Trade' bill. Very little of what the above email says about the legislation is accurate, however. Let's examine the substantive claims:
  CLAIM: Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Cap and Trade Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act.
  STATUS: FALSE. I've scoured Section 202 of the bill ('Building Retrofit Program'), which supposedly contains this mandate, and found nothing of the kind. Basically, this section lays out the details of a program whereby the federal government will help states provide financial assistance for local governments to conduct cost-effective energy-saving retrofits. Nowhere does it stipulate that owners of existing homes must comply with efficiency standards or obtain a 'license' to sell their homes. In point of fact, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's own summary of Section 202 states: 'Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements.'
  CLAIM: H.R. 2454, the 'Cap & Trade' bill passed by the House of Representatives, if also passed by the Senate, will be the largest tax increase any of us has ever experienced. The Congressional Budget Office (supposedly non-partisan) estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year.
  STATUS: FALSE. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that implementation of of H.R. 2454 would result in federal expenditures costing the average household $175 per year beginning in 2020 (CBO projects little or no cost to the average taxpayer before that).
  CLAIM: Sect. 204 - Building Energy Performance Labeling Program establishes a labeling program that for each individual residence will identify the achieved energy efficiency performance.... You will be required to post the label in a conspicuous location in your home and will not be allowed to sell your home without having this label.
  STATUS: FALSE AS STATED. Section 204 does provide for the development of a voluntary (for states) energy performance labeling program, but only for new buildings constructed after the legislation is enacted . It states that labeling information must be 'accessible to the public in a manner so that owners, lenders, tenants, occupants, of other relevant parties can utilize it,' which doesn't necessarily translate to 'You will be required to post the label in a conspicuous location in your home.' And, as before, the committee summary of Section 204 explicitly states: 'Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements.'
  CLAIM: Sect. 304 - Greater Energy Efficiency in Building Codes establishes new energy efficiency guidelines for the National Building Code and mandates at 304(d) that 1 year after enactment of this Act, all state and local jurisdictions must adopt the National Building Code energy efficiency provisions or must obtain a certification from the federal government that their state and/or local codes have been brought into full compliance with the National Building Code energy efficiency standards.
  STATUS: TRUE.

  Forwarded email claims HR 3590 (the 'Obamacare' bill) will require employees to pay additional income tax based on the value of employer-provided health insurance listed on W-2 forms.
  Description: Viral text Circulating since: April 2010 Status: False (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Ann N., July 6, 2010:
  Fw: 2011 W-2 Tax Forms - Nice Surprise - NOT FUNNY
  2011 W-2 Tax Forms and Obamacare
  Should you want to verify this, go to http://www.thomas.gov/, enter 'HR 3590' in the search box and look for 'CRS Summaries.' This is what you'll find.
  Title IX Revenue Provisions - Subtitle A: Revenue Offset
  '(Sec. 9002) Requires employers to include in the W-2 form of each employee the aggregate cost of applicable employer-sponsored group health coverage that is excludable from the employee's gross income (excluding the value of contributions to flexible spending arrangements).'
  Starting in 2011 - next year - the W-2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are provided. It doesn't matter if you're retired. Your gross income WILL go up by the amount of insurance your employer paid for. So you'll be required to pay taxes on a larger sum of money that you actually received. Take the tax form you just finished for 2009 and see what $15,000.00 or $20,000.00 additional gross income does to your tax debt. That's what you'll pay next year. For many it puts you into a much higher bracket. This is how the government is going to buy insurance for fifteen (15) percent that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases, but it's not really a 'tax increase' as such, it a redefinition of your taxable income.
  Also, go to Kiplinger's and read about the thirteen (13) tax changes for 2010 that could affect you.
  Why am I sending you this? The same reason I hope you forward this to every single person in your address book. People have the right to know the truth because an election is coming in November. So vote intelligently, based on your values. But also adjust your tax withholding, or increase your savings, so that you aren't surprised and put in a jam when your federal income taxes are due on April 15, 2012.
  Think before you vote!

  Highest Paid Female Actors Ever
  Analysis: False and misleading. While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) does require employers to include the aggregate cost of applicable employer-sponsored group health coverage on employees' W-2 tax forms beginning in 2011 (see text of bill , page 735), it does not require employees to pay income tax on that amount. Note that the quoted excerpt from the Congressional Research Service summary of the bill describes the cost as 'excludable from the employee's gross income.'
  Interestingly enough, the Kiplinger article referenced in the message reaches the same conclusion  'The amount reported is not considered taxable income'  though for some odd reason that isn't mentioned in the email.
  However, as the Kiplinger article further points out, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains other changes to the federal tax code that will result in some people's taxes increasing over the next few years. I recommend reading it for a concise, accurate overview of how health care reform will (and won't) impact your personal taxes: ' Health Care Reform: 13 Tax Changes on the Way .'
  According to a report by PolitiFact.com , the real reason employers will now be required to list the cost of group insurance on employees' tax forms is that beginning in 2014 it will be the IRS's job to verify whether individuals and their dependents have health care coverage as mandated by the legislation. Again, you will not pay personal income tax on that amount.

"Janet Reno Defines 'Cultist'","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/tommyhilfiger/a/tommy_hilfiger.htm","Is Tommy Hilfiger a Racist?","2007-04-16 20:59:03","  By David Emery
  Anecdotal reports circulating via email and social media claim fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger made racist statements during an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Despite denials by both Hilfiger and Winfrey, the false rumor continues to spread.
  Forwarded email text December 1998
  Subject: FWD: Tommy Hilfiger hates us...
  Did you see the recent Oprah Winfrey show on which Tommy Hilfiger was a guest? Oprah asked Hilfiger if his alleged statements about people of color were true - he's been accused of saying things such as 'If I had known that African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians would buy my clothes, I would not have made them so nice,' and 'I wish those people would not buy my clothes - they were made for upper-class whites.' What did he say when Oprah asked him if he said these things? He said 'Yes.' Oprah immediately asked Hilfiger to leave her show.
  Now, let's give Hilfiger what he's asked for - let's not buy his clothes. Boycott! Please - pass this message along.

  Best Vacation Reads of 2015
  In other examples, racial epithets were included.
  A whole lot of nice, earnest folks who surely don't consider themselves liars used the Internet to spread a false and libelous rumor about fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger. It comes to them in the form of a forwarded email or a shared social media post. They read it, they either believe it to be true or don't care if it's true, and they pass it on to friends, associates and people they hardly even know with the click of a mouse button or the tap of a share button.
  Knowingly or not, each one of these people becomes a link in a growing chain of scurrilous, hurtful lies. We know they are lies because the parties involved have issued repeated denials.
  Oprah Winfrey addressed the rumor personally during a show broadcast in 1999, summarized on her website as follows:
  Winfrey's exact words were quoted on Tommy Hilfiger's Website:
  Eight years later, on May 2, 2007 Tommy Hilfiger actually did appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show — for the first time, mind you — to put an end to this scurrilous rumor. View the video .
  Hilfiger, also quoted on his own website, stated the following:
  Further putting the lie to this misbegotten rumor are the results of an independent investigation conducted in 2001 by the Anti-Defamation League , which summarized its findings in a letter to Tommy Hilfiger :
  The Anti-Defamation League has received recurring inquiries regarding a number of defamatory rumors that have been spread on the Internet and by word-of-mouth in recent years about you and your company. Based upon our investigation, it is apparent to us that you never made the statements that attribute racist remarks to you. In some cases, the rumor alleges that you appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and made racist remarks, causing a supposedly irate Oprah to ask you to leave. We have concluded that these rumors are completely false, and it is apparent that you never made the statements attributed to you, nor did you appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show .
  Check the facts before you share a scurrilous email or social media post. All of this information is readily available on the internet. Look it up. There is no excuse for perpetuating this false rumor, for bearing false witness against a neighbor, when the truth is only a few links away.

"JFK: 'I am a Jelly Donut'","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/jfk_berliner.htm","JFK: 'I Am a Jelly Doughnut' ('Ich Bin ein Berliner')","2003-06-26 15:18:08","  By David Emery
  Did John F. Kennedy make a major German language blunder in his famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' speech in Berlin, Germany?
  The story goes that JFK should have said 'Ich bin Berliner' ('I am a citizen of Berlin'), and that 'Ich bin ein Berliner' really means 'I am a jelly doughnut.' A Berliner is, in fact, a type of jelly doughnut made in Berlin. But was this an error and a source of amusement and embarrassment?
  Notwithstanding reports to the contrary in such prestigious venues as the New York Times and Newsweek , this is truly The Gaffe That Never Was. Experts say Kennedy's grammar was flawless when he uttered those words on June 26, 1963. The phrase had been translated for him by a professional interpreter.
  German-speakers point out that President Kennedy said the phrase absolutely correctly, although possibly with a thick American accent. The German language has subtleties that very few non-native speakers grasp.
  continue reading below our video
  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  If President Kennedy had said 'Ich bin Berliner,' he would have sounded silly because with his heavy accent he couldn't possibly have come from Berlin. But by saying 'Ich bin ein Berliner,' he actually said 'I am one with the people of Berlin.' President Kennedy had a German journalist translate the phrase for him, and that journalist coached him at length on exactly how to say the phrase.
  Parenthetically, it is true that in some parts of Germany the word Berliner can just as well denote a certain kind of jelly-filled pastry as a citizen of Berlin. But it is unlikely to have cause confusion in the context. For example, telling a group of Americans that your editor is a New Yorker, would any of them really think you'd confused him with the weekly magazine of the same name? Consider the context.
  Laying decades of misinformation to rest, linguist Jürgen Eichhoff undertook a concise grammatical analysis of Kennedy's statement for the academic journal Monatshefte in 1993. ''Ich bin ein Berliner' is not only correct,' Eichhoff concluded, 'but the one and only correct way of expressing in German what the President intended to say.'
  An actual Berliner would say, in proper German, 'Ich bin Berliner.' But that wouldn't have been the right phrase for Kennedy to use. The addition of the indefinite article 'ein' is required, explains Eichhoff, to express a metaphorical identification between subject and predicate, otherwise the speaker could be taken to say he is literally a citizen of Berlin, which was obviously not Kennedy's intention.
  To give another example, the German sentences 'Er ist Politiker' and 'Er ist ein Politiker' both mean 'He is a politician,' but they're understood by German speakers as different statements with different meanings. The first means, more exactly, 'He is (literally) a politician.'  The second means 'He is (like) a politician.'  You would say of Barack Obama, for example, 'Er ist Politiker.' But you would say of an organizationally astute coworker, 'Er ist ein Politiker.'
  So, while the proper way for a Berlin resident to say 'I am a Berliner' is 'Ich bin Berliner,' the proper way for a non-resident to say he's a Berliner in spirit is precisely what Kennedy said: 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'  In spite of the fact that it can also be the correct way to say 'I am a jelly donut,' no adult German speaker could possibly have misunderstood Kennedy's meaning in context, or regarded it as a mistake.
  The man who actually translated the words into German for JFK is was Robert Lochner , the son of Associated Press correspondent Louis P. Lochner. The younger Lochner, educated in Berlin and a fluent speaker of German, was Kennedy's official interpreter on his visit to Germany. Lochner translated the phrase on paper then rehearsed it with JFK in Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt's office right up to the moment the speech was to be delivered.
  In the interests of international peace and harmony, we can be thankful that the president was well-coached that day before addressing his audience in their native tongue. Otherwise, God forbid, he might have stood before the German people and claimed to be a croissant. Quelle horreur!
  Following are examples of the 'I'm a jelly donut' tale making the rounds via old and new media in recent years:

"Joe Biden's Character","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/Money-In-Politics/tp/How-Much-Money-Do-You-Need-to-Run-for-President.htm","How Much Money Do You Need to Run for President?","2015-04-30 02:06:26","  By Tom Murse
  If you're thinking of running for president, you'd better be saving your pennies. It takes money to be taken seriously in politics. It takes money to raise money.
  How much money do you need to run for president?
  About $1 billion .
  Of course, presidents don't spend their own personal money. Their campaigns raise and spend money. They raise money from small and large contributors and super PACs .
  So how important is personal wealth in getting elected? Very. Money gets candidates in front of other rich people who fund campaigns. Money affords candidates time to campaign. How many successful presidents have won an election whole holding down a full-time job? Not many.
  There are, of course, exceptions to the rule.
  Here's a look at presidents past and future, and how much money it took them to get elected.
  The poorest commander-in-chief in American history was once described as one of the 'saddest cases of presidential hardship' who could barely provide for his family. That he was able to win the presidency despite his meager upbringing is remarkable in an age when almost all of the candidates elected to the White House are millionaires.
  So who was this president? More »
  Almost every modern president has been a millionaire at the time he was elected to the White House. That's a fact. So how rich were they? Here's a look at five modern presidents and their net worth at the time of their election.
  You might be surprised at who tops the list. More »
  No, none of the announced or likely presidential candidates in the 2016 election is among the 10 wealthiest members of Congress . But they're also not doing to badly. Each of the 2016 presidential candidates or likely presidential candidates is a millionaire.
  Here's a look at who's worth what. More »
  The wealthiest candidate in the 2012 presidential election was, far and away, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney . In fact, he was the wealthiest presidential candidate since billionaire Steve Forbes ran in 2000.
  So who else is on the list of wealthiest presidential candidates ever? And where did Romney rank among them? More »
  Yes, elected officials at almost every level of county, state and federal government make more than the average American worker. But they're not becoming millionaires by being in politics, despite the many perks of being in office.
  Most politicians are, in fact, millionaires before they're actually elected.
  So, in case you're wondering, here's a look at what politicians at every level bring home. More »
  The president's salary is set by Congress, and lawmakers have seen fit to raise the pay for the most powerful position in the world precisely five times since George Washington became the nation's first president in 1789.
  So how much does the president earn? More »
  The term country club Republican is used to describe GOP politicians and voters who are wealthier than most Americans and primarily care about fiscal issues such as cutting taxes and focus less on the social issues religious conservatives believe drive many people to the polls: abortion and gay marriage.
  It's not a positive term. In fact, if you're a politician you don't want to be labeled a country club Republican. Here's why. More »

"Joe Lieberman: Open Letter to the French People","http://history1900s.about.com/od/1930s/a/Evian.htm","Evian Conference","2013-06-02 04:13:02","  From July 6 to 15, 1938, representatives from 32 countries met at the resort town of Evian-les-Bains, France, at the request of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt , to discuss the issue of Jewish immigration from Nazi Germany. It was the hope of many that these countries could find a way to open their doors to allow more than their usual quotas of immigrants into their countries. Instead, although they commiserated with the plight of the Jews under the Nazis, every country but one refused to allow in more immigrants; the Dominican Republic was the only exception. In the end, the Evian Conference showed Germany that no one wanted the Jews, leading the Nazis to a different solution to the “Jewish question” – extermination.
  continue reading below our video
  What are the Seven Wonders of the World
  Despite these challenges, many Jews wished to remain in the land that they viewed as their home. Those that did wish to leave faced many difficulties. The Nazis wished to encourage emigration from Germany to make the Reich Judenrein (free of Jews); however, they placed many conditions upon the departure of their undesired Jews. Emmigrants had to leave behind valuables and the majority of their monetary assets. They also had to fill out reams of paperwork even for just the possibility of acquiring the necessary visa from another country.
  By the beginning of 1938, nearly 150,000 German Jews had left for other countries. Although this was 25 percent of the Jewish population in Germany at that time, the scope of the Nazi’s net widened drastically that spring when Austria was absorbed during the Anschluss .
  Additionally, it was becoming increasingly difficult for Jews to leave Europe and gain entrance to countries such as the United States, which was restricted by the quotas of their 1924 Immigration Restriction Act. Another popular option, Palestine, also had stringent restrictions in place; during the 1930s approximately 60,000 German Jews arrived in the Jewish homeland but they did so by meeting very strict conditions which required them to nearly start over financially.
  Instead of addressing United States policy, Roosevelt decided in March 1938 to divert attention away from the United States and asked Sumner Welles, the Under Secretary of State, to call for an international meeting to discuss the “refugee issue” that was presented by Nazi German policies.
  Italy and South Africa were also invited but chose not to actively participate; however, South Africa did choose to send an observer.
  Roosevelt announced that the official representative of the United States would be Myron Taylor, a non-government official who had served as an executive of U.S. Steel and a personal friend of Roosevelt.
  The League of Nations also had a representative on hand, as did the official agencies for German and Austrian Jews. A multitude of journalists from every major news outlet in the 32 nations were in attendance to cover the proceedings. Several members of the Nazi Party were also there; uninvited but not chased away.
  Even before the conference convened, the delegates of the represented countries were made aware that the main purpose of the conference was to hold a deliberation on the fate of the Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. In calling the conference, Roosevelt reiterated that its purpose was not to force any country to alter their current immigration policies. Instead, it was to see what could be done within existing legislation to possibly make the process of immigration for German Jews a bit more feasible.
  The first order of business of the conference was to elect chairmen. This process took up most of the first two days of the conference and much dissension occurred before a result was reached. In addition to Myron Taylor from the U.S., who was chosen as the lead chairman, Briton Lord Winterton and Henri Berenger, a member of the French senate, were chosen to preside with him.
  After deciding on chairmen, delegates from the represented countries and organizations were given ten minutes each to share their thoughts on the issue at hand. Each stood and expressed sympathy for the Jewish plight; however, none indicated that their country favored altering existing immigration policies in any significant degree to better address the refugee issue.
  Following the representatives for the countries, the various organizations were also given time to speak. Due to the length of time this process took, by the time most of the organizations had the opportunity to speak they were only allotted five minutes. Some organizations were not included at all and were then told to submit their comments for consideration in writing.
  Sadly, the stories they shared of mistreatment of the Jews of Europe, both verbally and in writing, did not appear to make much of an impact on the “Nations of Asylum.”
  During the discussion, Taylor spoke first and shared the official stance of the United States, which was to ensure that the full immigration quota of 25,957 immigrants per year from Germany (including annexed Austria) would be fulfilled. He reiterated the previous caveat that all immigrants destined for the U.S. must guarantee that they are able to support themselves.
  Taylor’s remarks shocked many of the delegations in attendance who initially thought the United States would step up to the task at hand. This lack of assistance set the tone for many other countries who were struggling to determine their own solutions.
  The delegations from England and France were even less willing to consider the possibility of immigration. Lord Winterton held fast to British resistance to further Jewish immigration to Palestine. In fact, Winterton’s deputy Sir Michael Palairet negotiated with Taylor to prevent two notable pro-Palestinian immigration Jews from speaking -- Dr. Chaim Weizmann and Mrs. Golda Meyerson (later Golda Meir).
  Winteron did note that a small number of immigrants could potentially be settled in East Africa; however, the allotted amount of spaces available was practically insignificant. The French were not any more willing.
  Both Britain and France also wanted assurances of the release of Jewish assets by the German government in order to aid with these small immigration allowances. The German government’s representatives refused to release any significant funds and the issue did not proceed any further.
  The Committee was based out of London and was supposed to receive support from the nations represented at Evian. It was led by American George Rublee, an attorney and, like Taylor, a personal friend of Roosevelt. As with the Evian Conference itself, virtually no concrete support materialized and the ICR was unable to fulfill its mission.
  Over six million Jews, two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population, would perish during the Holocaust .

  Subject: Great answer by Senator Glenn
  Ladies and gentlemen,
  Here's a small indication of what the military person runs up against in
 the beltway of our capital.  No wonder we have so many problems in
 Washington....
  Some people still don't understand why military personnel do what they do
 for a living.  This exchange between Senators John Glenn and Howard
Metzenbaum
 is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive impromptu speech, but
 its also a good example of one man's explanation of why men and women in
the
 uniformed services do what they do for a living. An example of what those
 who have never served think of the Military.
  Sen. Metzenbaum to Sen. Glenn:
 'How can you run for Senate when you have never held a real job?'
  Sen. Glenn: 'I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps. I served
 through two wars. I flew 149 missions.  My plane was hit by antiaircraft
 fire on 12 different occasions. I was in the space program. It wasn't my
 checkbook; it was my life on the line.  It was not a nine to five job
where I took time off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank.
  I ask you to go with me....as I went the other day to a Veterans hospital
 and look at those men with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them
they
 didn't hold a job.  You go with me to the space program and go as I have
gone to the widows and orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee
and
 you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their dad didn't hold a
job.
  You go with me on Memorial Day, coming up, and you stand in Arlington
 National Cemetery, where I have more friends than I'd like to remember and
 you watch those waving flags.  You stand there, and you think about this
 nation, and you tell me that those people didn't have a job, I'll tell
 you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life
 thanking God that there were some men - SOME MEN - who held a job.   And
 they required a dedication to purpose, a love of country and a dedication
to
duty that was more important than life itself. And their self sacrifice is
what
 made this country possible..... I HAVE HELD A JOB, HOWARD! What about you?'
  When some claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war, state
the following
  FDR...led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did.
 From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost an average of 112,500 per year.
  Truman... finished that war and started one in Korea, North Korea never
attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost an average of 18,334
per year.
  John F. Kennedy... started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never
attacked us.
  Johnson... turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives
were lost an average of 5,800 per year.
  Clinton... went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent, Bosnia
never attacked us. He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter
three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple
occasions.
  In the two years since terrorists attacked us President Bush
has... liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida,
put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a
shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own
people.
  The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but...It
took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch
Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation.
  We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less
time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing
records.
  It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to
destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to call the
police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick.
  It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in
Florida!!!!
  Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB!
  The Military morale is high!
  The biased media hopes we are too ignorant to realize the facts.
  Wait, there's more.......................
  JOHN GLENN ON THE SENATE FLOOR
  Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2004 11:13:37 -0800
  Some people still don't understand why military personnel do what they

Howard Metzenbaum is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive
impromptu speech, but it's also a good example of one man's explanation
of why men and women in the armed services do what they do for a living.
This IS a typical, though sad, example of what some who have never

  Senator Metzenbaum to Senator Glenn: 'How can you run for Senate when
you've never held a real job?'
  Senator Glenn: 'I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps. I

day... to a veteran's hospital and look those men - with their mangled
bodies - in the eye, and tell THEM they didn't hold a job! You go with
me to the Space Program at NASA and go, as I have gone, to the widows
and orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee... and you look
those kids in the eye and tell them that their DADS didn't hold a job.
You go with me on Memorial Day and you stand in Arlington National
Cemetery, where I have more friends buried than I'd like to remember,
and you watch those waving flags. You stand there, and you think about

required a dedication to a purpose - and a love of country and a
dedication to duty - that was more important than life itself. And their
self-sacrifice is what made this country possible. I HAVE held a job,
Howard! What about you?'
  For those who don't remember - During W.W.II, Howard Metzenbaum was an
attorney representing the Communist Party in the USA.
  Now he is a Senator! If you can read this, thank a teacher.... If you
are reading it in English thank a Veteran
  Comments: Although by some accounts Howard Metzenbaum did not at any time accuse John Glenn of literally never holding a job, an exchange similar to above did take place over a period of days during the 1974 Ohio primary election in which Glenn battled Metzenbaum for the Democratic nomination for U.S. senator.
  Metzenbaum, whose strategy throughout the campaign included questioning Glenn's civilian leadership experience, apparently remarked during a speech that the career Marine and former astronaut had 'never met a payroll,' or words to that effect. Somehow this morphed into 'never held a job' in the press coverage of the campaign (and continues to be reported that way to this day), and Glenn took the straw man and ran with it in a May 3, 1974 debate with Metzenbaum at the Cleveland City Club.
  Here, according to political columnist Mark Shields, is what Glenn actually said in that debate (other accounts differ only slightly):
  I was in the space program. It wasn't my checkbook. It was my life that was on the line. This was not a 9-to-5 job where I took time off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with me . . . as I went the other day to a Veterans Hospital and look those men with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother, and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job.
  You go with me to the space program, and you go as I have gone to the widows and the orphans of Ed White and Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee, and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their dad didn't hold a job.
  You go with me on Memorial Day coming up, and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery - where I have more friends than I like to remember - and you watch those waving flags, and you stand there, and you think about this nation, and you tell me that those people didn't have a job.
  I tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men - some men - who held a job. And they required a dedication to purpose and a love of country and a dedication to duty that was more important than life itself. And their self-sacrifice is what has made this country possible.... I have held a job, Howard.
  The text in the 2004 variant criticizing Democrats for not supporting President Bush's Iraq War was appended several years after this email flier began circulating and has nothing to do with John Glenn's 1974 remarks.
  As to the charge, also appended in a later variant, that Howard Metzenbaum worked as an attorney for the Communist Party during World War II, I have found no evidence so far to substantiate it.

  While nothing was official, most of the major U.S. news agencies began reporting the weekend of December 15, 2012, that President Barack Obama had decided to nominate Massachusetts Senator John Kerry to replace Hillary Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State. Those reports began surfacing little more than a day after U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice pulled her name out of consideration for the position.
  Kerry, chairman of the Senate's prestigious and influential Foreign Relations Committee, and Rice seemed to have an equal chance of getting the nod. (This writer always thought Kerry had a better than 50/50 shot.) That was until Republicans in the Senate -- which will have to confirm any nomination -- began questioning Rice's ability to lead the State Department based on her handling of questions after an Islamic attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012.
  Kerry said he understood how difficult was Rice's decision to withdraw.
  'As someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be, I've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks, but I also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction.' Rice will continue as ambassador to the U.N.
  While it looks like Kerry will indeed be Obama's pick, here is a quick bio of the Senator and former Democratic presidential contender.
  Kerry was born December 11, 1943, making him 69 at this writing. He was born at Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. His family soon moved to Massachusetts. He was raised in the Catholic Church.
  Kerry graduated from Yale University, then volunteered for the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. He served two tours of duty. During the second, he volunteered for 'swift boat' duty in the river deltas of South Vietnam.
  Between 1968 and 1973, the Navy used swift boats -- also known as PCFs or Patrol Craft Fast -- to prevent North Vietnamese forces from using the deltas to either infiltrate South Vietnam or push supplies into the country.
  In April 1971, Kerry testified as a Vietnam veteran before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He urged the committee to push for an end to the war, saying 'there is nothing in South Vietnam which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America.'
  Kerry received a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts for his service in Vietnam. When he was running for president against incumbent George W. Bush in 2004, a group known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth challenged Kerry's decorations . They alleged that he either did not deserve them, or had fabricated scenarios that would result in decorations to further a political career.
  Kerry vehemently denied the charges, and claimed they were a tool of his Republican opponents. The charges may also have been prompted by Kerry's Senate testimony in 1971. (Bush also faced charges during the election of having hidden from active service in the Vietnam War by joining the Texas Air National Guard.)
  Upon returning home, Kerry entered the Boston College Law School, graduating in 1976. He became a prosecutor in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
  Kerry won election as Massachusetts lieutenant governor in 1982. In 1984, he won his first term in the United States Senate, becoming junior senator behind Ted Kennedy. Kerry is now in his fifth six-year term in the Senate.
  Throughout his senate career Kerry has championed many military causes. They include:
  Kerry has also been the ranking Democrat in the Senate's East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, which will give him an edge as the Obama Administration refocuses U.S. attention on that region.
  Finally, Kerry has backed such domestic issues as support for small businesses, environmental protection, advances in education, and federal fiscal discipline.

"John Kerry Criticized by Swift Boat Veterans","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_swift_boat_veterans.htm","Swift Boat Veterans vs. John Kerry","2016-03-28 21:43:48","  By David Emery
  Description: Forwarded email Circulating since: June 2004 Status:  Politics as usual (see details below)
  Example: Email contributed by Frank C., June 3, 2004:
  Subject: SWIFT BOAT QUOTES
  THIS NEEDS TO GET TO EVERYBODY WHO VOTES--MILITARY ESPECIALLY........
  'We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book 'Tour of Duty.' We think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our unit and other units in Vietnam. We think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.
  We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief.'
  -- John O'Neill, spokesman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth
  'I do not believe John Kerry is fit to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States. This is not a political issue. It is a matter of his judgment, truthfulness, reliability, loyalty and trust -- all absolute tenets of command. His biography, 'Tour of Duty,' by Douglas Brinkley, is replete with gross exaggerations, distortions of fact, contradictions and slanderous lies. His contempt for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review of this biography.
  He arrived in-country with a strong anti-Vietnam War bias and a self-serving determination to build a foundation for his political future. He was aggressive, but vain and prone to impulsive judgment, often with disregard for specific tactical assignments. He was a 'loose cannon.'
  In an abbreviated tour of four months and 12 days, and with his specious medals secure, Lt.(jg) Kerry bugged out and began his infamous betrayal of all United States forces in the Vietnam War. That included our soldiers, our marines, our sailors, our coast guardsmen, our airmen, and our POWs. His leadership within the so-called Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testimony before Congress in 1971 charging us with unspeakable atrocities remain an undocumented but nevertheless meticulous stain on the men and women who honorably stayed the course. Senator Kerry is not fit for command.'
  -- Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman, USN (retired), chairman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth
  'During Lt.(jg) Kerry's tour, he was under my command for two or three specific operations, before his rapid exit. Trust, loyalty and judgment are the key, operative words. His turncoat performance in 1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served, including all POWs and MIAs, as murderous war criminals, I believe, will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their families.
  Kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative, disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that you'd hear is 'requires constant supervision.''
  -- Captain Charles Plum, USN (retired)
  'Thirty-five years ago, many of us fell silent when we came back to the stain of sewage that Mr. Kerry had thrown on us, and all of our colleagues who served over there. I don't intend to be silent today or ever again.
  Our young men and women who are serving deserve no less.'
  -- Andrew Horne
  'In my specific, personal experience in both coastal and river patrols over a 12-month period, I never once saw or heard anything remotely resembling the atrocities described by Senator Kerry. If I had, it would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher authority, and I would certainly have done that. If Senator Kerry actually witnessed or participated in these atrocities or, as he described them, 'war crimes,' he was obligated to report them. That he did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me as opportunism of the worst kind. That he would malign my service and that of his fellow sailors with no regard for the truth makes him totally unqualified to serve as Commander-in-Chief.'
  -- Jeffrey Wainscott
  'I signed that letter because I, too felt a deep sense of betrayal that someone who took the same oath of loyalty as I did as an officer in the United States Navy would abandon his group here (points to group photo) to join this group here (points to VVAW protest photo), and come home and attempt to rally the American public against the effort that this group was so valiantly pursuing.
  It is a fact that in the entire Vietnam War we did not lose one major battle. We lost the war at home... and at home, John Kerry was the Field General.'
  -- Robert Elder
  'My daughters and my wife have read portions of the book 'Tour of Duty.' They wanted to know if I took part in the atrocities described. I do not believe the things that are described happened.
  Let me give you an example. In Brinkley's book, on pages 170 to 171, about something called the 'Bo De massacre' on November 24th of 1968... In Kerry's description of the engagement, first he claimed there were 17 servicemen that were wounded. Three of us were wounded. I was the first...'
  -- Joseph Ponder
  'While in Cam Rahn Bay, he trained on several 24-hour indoctrination missions, and one special skimmer operation with my most senior and trusted Lieutenant. The briefing from some members of that crew the morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and yet Lt.(jg) Kerry informed me of a wound -- he showed me a scratch on his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from one of our own M-79s. It was later reported to me that Lt.(jg) Kerry had fired an M-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. I do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably said something like 'Forget it.' He later received a Purple Heart for that scratch, and I have no information as to how or whom.
  Lt.(jg) Kerry was allowed to return to the good old USA after 4 months and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities. Today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. Our rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of Swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if there was a possibility that innocent people -- fishermen, in a lot of cases -- might be hurt or injured. The rules and the good intentions of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly casualties.'
  -- Commander Grant Hibbard, USN (retired)
  'Lt. Kerry returned home from the war to make some outrageous statements and allegations... of numerous criminal acts in violation of the law of war were cited by Kerry, disparaging those who had fought with honor in that conflict. Had war crimes been committed by US forces in Vietnam? Yes, but such acts were few and far between. Yet Lt. Kerry have numerous speeches and testimony before Congress inappropriately leading his audiences to believe that what was only an anomaly in the conduct of America's fighting men was an epidemic. Furthermore, he suggested that they were being encouraged to violated the law of war by those within the chain of command.
  Very specific orders, on file at the Vietnam archives at Texas Tech University, were issued by my father [Admiral Elmo Zumwalt] and others in his chain of command instructing subordinates to act responsibly in preserving the life and property of Vietnamese civilians.'
  -- Lt. Col. James Zumwalt, USMC (retired)
  'We look at Vietnam... after all these years it is still languishing in isolated poverty and helplessness and tyranny. This is John Kerry's legacy.
  I deeply resent John Kerry's using his Swift boat experience, and his betrayal of those who fought there as a stepping-stone to his political ambitions.'
  -- Barnard Wolff
  'In a whole year that I spent patrolling, I didn't see anything like a war crime, an atrocity, anything like that. Time and again I saw American fighting men put themselves in graver danger trying to avoid... collateral damage.
  When John Kerry returned to the country, he was sworn in front of Congress. And then he told my family -- my parents, my sister, my brother, my neighbors -- he told everyone I knew and everyone I'd ever know that I and my comrades had committed unspeakable atrocities.'
  -- David Wallace
  'I served with these guys. I went on missions with them, and these men served honorably. Up and down the chain of command there was no acquiescence to atrocities. It was not condoned, it did not happen, and it was not reported to me verbally or in writing by any of these men including Lt.(jg) Kerry.
  In 1971, '72, for almost 18 months, he stood before the television audiences and claimed that the 500,000 men and women in Vietnam, and in combat, were all villains -- there were no heroes. In 2004, one hero from the Vietnam War has appeared, running for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief. It just galls one to think about it.'
  -- Captain George Elliott, USN (retired)
  'During the Vietnam War I was Task Force Commander at An Thoi, and my tour of duty was 13 months, from the end of Tet to the beginning of the Vietnamization of the Navy units.
  Now when I went there right after Tet, I was restricted in my movements. I couldn't go much of anyplace because the Vietcong controlled most of the area. When I left, I could go anywhere I wanted, just about. Commerce was booming, the buses were running, trucks were going, the waterways were filled with sampans with goods going to market, but yet in Kerry's biography he says that our operations were a complete failure. He also mentions a formal conference with me, to try to get more air cover and so on. That conference never happened...'
  -- Captain Adrian Lonsdale, USCG (retired)
  'I was in An Thoi from June of '68 to June of '69, covering the whole period that John Kerry was there. I operated in every river, in every canal, and every off-shore patrol area in the 4th Corps area, from Cambodia all the way around to the Bo De River. I never saw, even heard of all of these so-called atrocities and things that we were supposed to have done.
  This is not true. We're not standing for it. We want to set the record straight.'
  -- William Shumadine
  'In 1971, when John Kerry spoke out to America, labeling all Vietnam veterans as thugs and murderers, I was shocked and almost brought to my knees, because even though I had served at the same time and same unit, I had never witnessed or participated in any of the events that the Senator had accused us of. I strongly believe that the statements made by the Senator were not only false and inaccurate, but extremely harmful to the United States' efforts in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Tragically, some veterans, scorned by the antiwar movement and their allies, retreated to a life of despair and suicide. Two of my crewmates were among them. For that there is no forgiveness. '
  -- Richard O'Meara
  'My name is Steve Gardner. I served in 1966 and 1967 on my first tour of duty in Vietnam on Swift boats, and I did my second tour in '68 and '69, involved with John Kerry in the last 2 1/2 months of my tour. The John Kerry that I know is not the John Kerry that everybody else is portraying. I served alongside him and behind him, five feet away from him in a gun tub, and watched as he made indecisive moves with our boat, put our boats in jeopardy, put our crews in jeopardy... if a man like that can't handle that 6-man crew boat, how can you expect him to be our Commander-in-Chief?'
  -- Steven Gardner
  'I served in Vietnam as a boat officer from June of 1968 to July of 1969. My service was three months in Coastal Division 13 out of Cat Lo, and nine months with Coastal Division 11 based in An Thoi. John Kerry was in An Thoi the same time I was. I'm here today to express the anger I have harbored for over 33 years, about being accused with my fellow shipmates of war atrocities.
  All I can say is when I leave here today, I'm going down to the Wall to tell my two crew members it's not true, and that they and the other 49 Swiftees who are on the Wall were then and are still now the best.'
  -- Robert Brant
  'I never saw, heard of, or participated in any Swift boat crews killing cattle, poisoning crops, or raping and killing civilians as charged by John Kerry, both in his book and in public statements. Since we both operated at the same time, in the same general area, and on the same missions under the same commanders, it is hard to believe his claims of atrocities and poor planning of Sea Lord missions.
  I signed this letter because I feel that he used Swift boat sailors to proclaim his antiwar statements after the war, and now he uses the same Swift boat sailors to support his claims of being a war hero. He cannot have it both ways, and we are here to ask for full disclosure of the proof of his claims.'
  -- James Steffes
  Analysis: All of the above quotes are authentic so far as I can tell, but don't be misled by this partisan political screed. Albeit frequently forwarded under the title 'John Kerry's Shipmates Speak Out,' only one of the men quoted in the message, Steven Gardner, actually served under John Kerry when he was a swift boat captain during the Vietnam War.
  According to historian Douglas Brinkley, author of a book on the candidate's military career, Gardner's appraisal of Kerry is distinctly at odds with that of every other surviving member of Kerry's swift boat crews, not to mention Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Chief of U.S. Naval Operations during Kerry's tour of duty, who has stated: 'Lt. Kerry's calmness, professionalism and great personal courage under fire were in keeping with the highest traditions of the US Naval Service.'
  The rest of the signatories served in various capacities connected with swift boat operations  Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman as commander of Operation Sealords, for example, overseeing missions conducted by more than 100 swift boats in Vietnam; Grant Hibbard as Kerry's squadron commander; John O'Neill as the skipper of John Kerry's boat after he left Vietnam; and others as captains or sailors on swift boats other than Kerry's.
  All of them belong to a Republican-backed organization called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, whose main beef with John Kerry, it appears  apart from the fact that he is the Democratic candidate for the presidency  is that after his discharge he spoke out against the Vietnam War and testified before Congress that U.S. military personnel had committed atrocities. In fairness, Kerry was not the only Vietnam veteran to do so, and these issues continue to impassion and divide veterans of good conscience to this day.
  As to the intimation that Kerry was an unfit commander, that he didn't deserve Bronze and Silver Stars for valor or that he wasn't seriously enough injured to earn three Purple Hearts, his official Navy records on JohnKerry.com and the testimony of his shipmates supply proof to the contrary.
  When similar charges along with the claim that Kerry has outright lied about his service record were repeated in an August 2004 television advertisement produced by the same group (Swift Boat Veterans for Truth), Republican Senator and Vietnam veteran John McCain denounced the allegations as 'dishonest and dishonorable.'

"John Kerry 'Didn't Have Time' for Briefing on al Qaeda Attacks","http://usliberals.about.com/od/homelandsecurit1/a/ObamaIrqWr.htm","Iraq | Facts and History","2012-02-13 02:16:38","  By Kallie Szczepanski
  The modern nation of Iraq is built upon foundations that go back to some of humanity's earliest complex cultures. It was in Iraq, also known as Mesopotamia , that Babylonian king Hammurabi regularized the law in the Code of Hammurabi, c. 1772 BCE.
  Under Hammurabi's system, society would inflict upon a criminal the same harm that the criminal had inflicted upon his victim. This is codified in the famous dictum, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' More recent Iraqi history, however, tends to support the Mahatma Gandhi's take on this rule. He is supposed to have said that 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'
  Capital: Baghdad, population 9,500,000 (2008 estimate)
  Major cities: Mosul, 3,000,000
  Basra, 2,300,000
  Arbil, 1,294,000
  Kirkuk, 1,200,000
  The Republic of Iraq is a parliamentary democracy. The head of state is the president, currently Jalal Talabani, while the head of government is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki .

  Overview of the Iraq War
  The unicameral parliament is called the Council of Representatives; its 325 members serve four-year terms. Eight of those seats are specifically reserved for ethnic or religious minorities.
  Iraq's judiciary system consists of the Higher Judicial Council, the Federal Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Cassation, and lower courts. ('Cassation' literally means 'to quash' - it is another term for appeals, evidently taken from the French legal system.)
  Iraq has a total population of about 30.4 million. The population growth rate is an estimated 2.4%. About 66% of Iraqis live in urban areas.
  Some 75-80% of Iraqis are Arabs. Another 15-20% are Kurds , by far the largest ethnic minority; they live primarily in northern Iraq. The remaining roughly 5% of the population is made up of Turkomen, Assyrians, Armenians, Chaldeans and other ethnic groups.
  Both Arabic and Kurdish are official languages of Iraq. Kurdish is an Indo-European language related to Iranian languages.
  Minority languages in Iraq include Turkoman, which is a Turkic language; Assyrian, a Neo-Aramaic language of the Semitic language family; and Armenian, an Indo-European language with possible Greek roots. Thus, although the total number of languages spoken in Iraq is not high, the linguistic variety is great.
  Iraq is an overwhelmingly Muslim country, with an estimated 97% of the population following Islam . Perhaps unfortunately, it is also among the most even divided countries on Earth in terms of Sunni and Shi'a populations; 60 to 65% of Iraqis are Shi'a, while 32 to 37% are Sunni.
  Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni minority controlled the government, often persecuting Shi'as. Since the new constitution was implemented in 2005, Iraq is supposed to be a democratic country, but the Shi'a/Sunni split is a source of much tension as the nation sorts out a new form of government.
  Iraq also has a small Christian community, around 3% of the population. During the nearly decade-long war following the US-led invasion in 2003, many Christians fled Iraq for Lebanon , Syria, Jordan, or western countries.
  Iraq is a desert country, but it is watered by two major rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates. Only 12% of Iraq's land is arable. It controls a 58 km (36 mile) coast on the Persian Gulf, where the two rivers empty into the Indian Ocean.
  Iraq is bordered by Iran to the east, Turkey and Syria to the north, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the west, and Kuwait to the southeast. Its highest point is Cheekah Dar, a mountain in the north of the country, at 3,611 m (11,847 feet). Its lowest point is sea level.
  As a subtropical desert, Iraq experiences extreme seasonal variation in temperature. In parts of the country, July and August temperatures average over 48°C (118°F). During the rainy winter months of December through March, however, temperatures drop below freezing not infrequently. Some years, heavy mountain snow in the north produces dangerous flooding on the rivers.
  The lowest temperature recorded in Iraq was -14°C (7°F). The highest temperature was 54°C (129°F).
  Another key feature of Iraq's climate is the sharqi , a southerly wind that blows from April through early June, and again in October and November. It gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), causing sand storms that can be seen from space.
  The economy of Iraq is all about oil; 'black gold' provides more than 90% of government revenue, and accounts for 80% of the country's foreign exchange income. As of 2011, Iraq was producing 1.9 million barrels per day of oil, while consuming 700,000 barrels per day domestically. (Even as it exports almost 2 million barrels per day, Iraq also imports 230,000 barrels per day.)
  Since the start of the US-led War in Iraq in 2003, foreign aid has become a major component of Iraq's economy, as well. The US has pumped some $58 billion dollars worth of aid into the country between 2003 and 2011; other nations have pledge an additional $33 billion in reconstruction aid.
  Iraq's workforce is employed primarily in the service sector, although about 15 to 22% work in agriculture. The unemployment rate is around 15%, and an estimated 25% of Iraqis live below the poverty line.
  The Iraqi currency is the dinar . As of February 2012, $1 US is equal to 1,163 dinar.
  Part of the Fertile Crescent, Iraq was one of the early sites of complex human civilization and agricultural practice. Once called Mesopotamia , Iraq was the seat of the Sumerian and Babylonian cultures c. 4,000 - 500 BCE. During this early period, Mesopotamians invented or refined technologies such as writing and irrigation; the famous King Hammurabi (r. 1792- 1750 BCE) recorded the law in the Code of Hammurabi, and over a thousand of years later, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605 - 562 BCE) built the incredible Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
  After about 500 BCE, Iraq was ruled by a succession of Persian dynasties, such as the Achaemenids , the Parthians , the Sassanids and the Seleucids . Although local governments existed in Iraq, they were under Iranian control until the 600s CE.
  In 633, the year after the Prophet Muhammad died, a Muslim army under Khalid ibn Walid invaded Iraq. By 651, the soldiers of Islam had brought down the Sassanid Empire in Persia, and began to Islamicize the region that is now Iraq and Iran .
  Between 661 and 750, Iraq was a dominion of the Umayyad Caliphate , which ruled from Damascus (now in Syria ). The Abbasid Caliphate , which ruled the Middle East and North Africa from 750 to 1258, decided to build a new capital closer to the political power hub of Persia. It built the city of Baghdad, which became a center of Islamic art and learning.
  In 1258, catastrophe struck the Abbasids and Iraq in the form the Mongols under Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan . The Mongols demanded that Baghdad surrender, but the Caliph Al-Mustasim refused. Hulagu's troops laid siege to Baghdad, taking the city with at least 200,000 Iraqi dead. The Mongols also burned the Grand Library of Baghdad and its wonderful collection of documents - one of the great crimes of history. The caliph himself was executed by being rolled in a carpet and trampled by horses; this was an honorable death in Mongol culture, because none of the caliph's noble blood touched the ground.
  Hulagu's army would meet defeat by the Egyptian Mamluk slave-army in the Battle of Ayn Jalut . In the Mongols' wake, however, the Black Death carried away about a third of Iraq's population. In 1401, Timur the Lame (Tamerlane) captured Baghdad, and ordered another massacre of its people.
  Timur's fierce army only controlled Iraq for a few years, and was supplanted by the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Empire would rule Iraq from the fifteenth century through 1917, when Britain wrested the Middle East from Turkish control and the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
  Under the British/French plan to divide the Middle East, the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, Iraq became part of the British Mandate. On November 11, 1920, the region became a British mandate under the League of Nations, called the 'State of Iraq.' Britain brought in a (Sunni) Hashemite king from the region of Mecca and Medina, now in Saudi Arabia, to rule over the primarily Shi'a Iraqis and Kurds of Iraq, sparking widespread discontent and rebellion.
  In 1932, Iraq gained nominal independence from Britain, although the British-appointed King Faisal still ruled the country and the British military had special rights in Iraq. The Hashemites ruled until 1958, when King Faisal II was assassinated in a coup led by Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim. This signaled the beginning of a rule by a series of strongmen over Iraq, which lasted through 2003.
  Qasim's rule survived for just five years, before being overthrown in turn by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in February of 1963. Three years later, Arif's brother took power after the colonel died; however, he would rule Iraq for just two years before being deposed by a Ba'ath Party-led coup in 1968. The Ba'athist government was led by Ahmed Hasan Al-Bakir at first, but he was slowly elbowed aside over the next decade by Saddam Hussein .
  Saddam Hussein formally seized power as president of Iraq in 1979. The following year, feeling threatened by rhetoric from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , new leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran that led to the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War .
  Hussein himself was a secularist, but the Ba'ath Party was dominated by Sunnis. Khomeini hoped that Iraq's Shi'ite majority would rise up against Hussein in an Iranian Revolution -style movement, but that did not happen. With support from the Gulf Arab states and the United States, Saddam Hussein was able to fight the Iranians to a stalemate. He also took the opportunity to use chemical weapons against tens of thousands of Kurdish and Marsh Arab civilians within his own country, as well as against the Iranian troops, in blatant violation of international treaty norms and standards.
  Its economy ravaged by the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq decided to invade the small but wealthy neighboring nation of Kuwait in 1990. Saddam Hussein announced that he had annexed Kuwait; when he refused to withdraw, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to take military action in 1991 in order to oust the Iraqis. An international coalition led by the United States (which had been allied with Iraq just three years earlier) routed the Iraqi Army in a matter of months, but Saddam Hussein's troops set fire to Kuwaiti oil wells on their way out, causing an ecological disaster along the Persian Gulf coast. This fighting would come to be known as the First Gulf War .
  Following the First Gulf War, the United States patrolled a no-fly zone over the Kurdish north of Iraq to protect civilians there from Saddam Hussein's government; Iraqi Kurdistan began to function as a separate country, even while nominally still part of Iraq. Throughout the 1990s, the international community was concerned that Saddam Hussein's government was trying to develop nuclear weapons. In 1993, the US also learned that Hussein had made a plan to assassinate President George H. W. Bush during the First Gulf War. The Iraqis allowed UN weapons inspectors in to the country, but expelled them in 1998, claiming that they were CIA spies. In October of that year, US President Bill Clinton called for 'regime change' in Iraq.
  After George W. Bush became president of the United States in 2000, his administration began to prepare for a war against Iraq. Bush the younger resented Saddam Hussein's plans to kill Bush the elder, and made the case that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons despite rather flimsy evidence. The September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC gave Bush the political cover he needed to launch a Second Gulf War, even though Saddam Hussein's government had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks.
  The Iraq War began on March 20, 2003, when a US-led coalition invaded Iraq from Kuwait. The coalition drove the Ba'athist regime out of power, installing an Iraqi Interim Government in June of 2004, and organizing free elections for October of 2005. Saddam Hussein went in to hiding, but was captured by US troops on December 13, 2003. In the chaos, sectarian violence broke out across the country between the Shi'a majority and the Sunni minority; al-Qaeda seized the opportunity to establish a presence in Iraq.
  Iraq's interim government tried Saddam Hussein for the killing of Iraqi Shi'ites in 1982, and sentenced him to death. Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006.

  Subject: Kerry and the Bible
  This guy is going to implode!
  Thought you might find this interesting...
  HMMMMMM!!!!!!
  The Lord has a way of revealing those of us who really know him, and those that don't! Think about it! Kerry gave a big speech last week about how his faith is so 'important' to him. In this attempt to convince the American people that we should consider him for president, he announced that his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3. Of course the speech writer meant John 3:16, but nobody in the Kerry camp was familiar enough with scripture to catch the error. And do you know what John 16:3 says?
  John 16:3 says; 'They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.'
  Analysis: False. John Kerry never said his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3, or anything resembling it. Neither did G.W. Bush , who was accused of making the same blunder a few months before. Nor did Al Gore , who purportedly said exactly the same thing in 1999.
  Interestingly enough, G.W. Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, did make precisely this mistake during a speech before a religious broadcasters' conference in 1990, according to newspaper columnist Cal Thomas, who witnessed the event firsthand.

"John Kerry's 'Foreign Enterprises' (Heinz Outsourcing)","http://usliberals.about.com/od/liberalpersonalprofiles/p/Profile-Of-Sen-John-Kerry-Of-Massachusetts.htm","A Biography of John Kerry","2012-12-17 01:47:25","  By Steve Jones
  While nothing was official, most of the major U.S. news agencies began reporting the weekend of December 15, 2012, that President Barack Obama had decided to nominate Massachusetts Senator John Kerry to replace Hillary Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State. Those reports began surfacing little more than a day after U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice pulled her name out of consideration for the position.
  Kerry, chairman of the Senate's prestigious and influential Foreign Relations Committee, and Rice seemed to have an equal chance of getting the nod. (This writer always thought Kerry had a better than 50/50 shot.) That was until Republicans in the Senate -- which will have to confirm any nomination -- began questioning Rice's ability to lead the State Department based on her handling of questions after an Islamic attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012.
  Kerry said he understood how difficult was Rice's decision to withdraw.
  'As someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be, I've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks, but I also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction.' Rice will continue as ambassador to the U.N.
  While it looks like Kerry will indeed be Obama's pick, here is a quick bio of the Senator and former Democratic presidential contender.
  Kerry was born December 11, 1943, making him 69 at this writing. He was born at Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. His family soon moved to Massachusetts. He was raised in the Catholic Church.
  Kerry graduated from Yale University, then volunteered for the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. He served two tours of duty. During the second, he volunteered for 'swift boat' duty in the river deltas of South Vietnam.
  Between 1968 and 1973, the Navy used swift boats -- also known as PCFs or Patrol Craft Fast -- to prevent North Vietnamese forces from using the deltas to either infiltrate South Vietnam or push supplies into the country.
  In April 1971, Kerry testified as a Vietnam veteran before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He urged the committee to push for an end to the war, saying 'there is nothing in South Vietnam which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America.'
  Kerry received a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts for his service in Vietnam. When he was running for president against incumbent George W. Bush in 2004, a group known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth challenged Kerry's decorations . They alleged that he either did not deserve them, or had fabricated scenarios that would result in decorations to further a political career.
  Kerry vehemently denied the charges, and claimed they were a tool of his Republican opponents. The charges may also have been prompted by Kerry's Senate testimony in 1971. (Bush also faced charges during the election of having hidden from active service in the Vietnam War by joining the Texas Air National Guard.)
  Upon returning home, Kerry entered the Boston College Law School, graduating in 1976. He became a prosecutor in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
  Kerry won election as Massachusetts lieutenant governor in 1982. In 1984, he won his first term in the United States Senate, becoming junior senator behind Ted Kennedy. Kerry is now in his fifth six-year term in the Senate.
  Throughout his senate career Kerry has championed many military causes. They include:
  Kerry has also been the ranking Democrat in the Senate's East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, which will give him an edge as the Obama Administration refocuses U.S. attention on that region.
  Finally, Kerry has backed such domestic issues as support for small businesses, environmental protection, advances in education, and federal fiscal discipline.

"John Kerry's 'Front Porch Meeting' in Canonsburg, PA","https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-start-a-high-tech-neighborhood-watch-2487721","How to Start a High-Tech Neighborhood Watch","2011-08-07 00:29:20","  We all want to keep our families as safe as possible. We have locks on our doors, alarm systems, large dogs (or small angry overconfident ones). Many of us even have a neighborhood watch, which in most cases consists of a couple of old men with walkie-talkies who walk or drive around the neighborhood once in a while, shining their flashlights on stuff.
  I want you to consider your neighborhood watch as the outer-layer of your home network perimeter security.
  Perimeter security is as important as firewalls, anti-virus, and wireless security because all those things won't help you if a bad guy comes into your house and steals your computer.
  Let's take some perimeter security concepts, mix them with a little social media, add a dash of networked surveillance and see if we can bring the old neighborhood watch concept into the 21st century.
  Here are some high-tech tools and approaches you can add to your neighborhood watch to try and make it a little more effective:
  1. Use Google Maps to Survey Your Neighborhood's Security Posture
  Google Maps can be used by criminals to virtually visit, or 'case', a location that they are thinking of robbing. They can use Google Street View to simulate pulling up in front of a house to see how high a fence is, where a gate is located, etc.
  You can use the bird's eye satellite view in Google Maps to make neighborhood watch patrol assignment maps, see if a neighborhood perimeter fence has any damage, etc.
  You can also use services that take advantage of Google Maps like SpotCrime which is a free service that shows you a detailed history of crimes in and around your neighborhood. Armed with this information you can determine which areas of your neighborhood might need more protection or surveillance.
  2. Use Social Media to Involve Your Neighbors
  Social media is a great way to share information with your neighbors. You can create a neighborhood watch Facebook group and set it to 'private' where only those people who are part of your watch team are permitted access. Restricting access is a good idea because you probably don't want the bad guys knowing what security measures you are taking.
  There is a social media neighborhood watch site called Home Elephant that integrates with Facebook. Home Elephant lets you easily join with your neighbors to create an online neighborhood watch complete with crime watches, lost and founds, a neighborhood calendar, and other great features. Access to Home Elephant is free and they even have a free iPhone / iPad app that provides cell phone-based neighborhood alerts as well as quick picture uploading of sketchy happenings.
  Encourage your neighborhood watch team members to take their cell phones with them while they are out on patrol. If they see a suspicious car or person in the area they can take a picture and upload it to your social media neighborhood watch group to let others know instantly what to be on the lookout for.
  3. Setup neighborhood watch IP cameras and set them to record 24/7
  While the two old men who patrol your neighborhood with their walkie-talkie's might be retired Seal Team Six members, even they have to sleep. Surveillance cameras provide and unblinking eye and can stay on duty 24/7, recording everything happening within their field of view.
  Outdoor weatherproof cameras are getting cheaper and easier to setup. The Foscam FI8905 is a wireless weatherproof camera with night vision and sells for around $90 US. These cameras can be easily setup outside a watch member's house and aimed at neighborhood entrances, exits, and cross-streets. Access to the cameras can be restricted to prevent unauthorized viewing. The streams can be viewed via most web browsers without the need for any special software.
  Since the cameras are accessible from the internet, the neighborhood watch leader can setup a home computer equipped with inexpensive DVR software such as Evological's EvoCam which can record video from multiple cameras and save them to the local hard drive or on a remote file server. If there are any incidents in the area, watch leaders can share the video footage with local law enforcement.
  Many of the newer IP security cameras on the market include an SD memory card-based backup to save footage in case they temporarily loose their network connection .
  Ask your neighborhood association to set aside some of the association dues you pay every year for a security budget to cover costs for items such as outdoor cameras and other security related items.
  Encourage neighbors to consider purchasing cameras to watch their own properties as well. There are extremely simple and inexpensive wireless camera systems now available such as VueZone's completely wireless camera system which is motion activated, can be placed just about anywhere, and can be viewed via a smart phone.
  4. Connect with local law enforcement
  Let local law enforcement know what you are doing to protect your neighborhood. Invite them to your watch meetings. Provide them with access to your social media neighborhood watch groups and give them logins for your surveillance camera feeds.
  Obtain the e-mail addresses and phone numbers of the officers that are responsible for your local area. If you see something or someone suspicious, send the officer a picture and include the time, date, location, and reason why you thought it was suspicious.
  5. Do your part to make your home a less attractive target
  There are many cheap and easy things you can do to fortify your home's security. Keep shrubbery trimmed low around windows and doors. Add landscape flood lights to remove any potential hiding areas. Add door reinforcement hardware such as Armor Concepts Door Jamb Armor to prevent door kick-ins.
  In the end, the key to an effective neighborhood watch program, whether it's high-tech or low-tech, is community involvement and active participation. Now get out there and offer to take a patrol shift before the old man falls asleep. Don't forget your flashlight.

  Example: Email contributed by Peter R., Feb. 13, 2004:
  Unlike another viral image showing Kerry and Fonda within spitting distance of one another at a '70s anti-war rally, the above image, including headline and caption, is a hoax. The original, unaltered photo of Kerry, taken June 13, 1970, documents the Vietnam War veteran sitting alone prior to giving a speech at an outdoor peace rally. Fonda's likeness was photoshopped in at a later date (both original photos are owned by Corbis ).
  Update: ' The Real Fake ' - Photographer Ken Light describes the experience of encountering his original 1970 photograph of John Kerry circulating in an altered state on the Internet. 'As far as I know, John Kerry never shared a demonstration podium with Jane Fonda, and the fact that a widely circulated photo showed him doing so  until it was exposed in recent weeks as a hoax  tells us more about the troublesome combination of Photoshop and the Internet than it does about the prospective Democratic candidate for president.'

"John McCain: My Holiday with John McCain","http://usliberals.about.com/od/obamavsmccainin08/a/McCainLoss.htm","Five Reasons Why Obama Won the '08 Election","2008-10-19 22:41:43","  Barack Obama decisively won the presidential election, for many solid reasons and due to many factors, including weaknesses of his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain.
  This article enumerates and explains five top reasons why Obama won win the 2008 race to become the 44th President of the United States.
  Reason #1 - Empathy and Genuine Help for Middle-Class Americans
  Barack Obama 'gets' what it means for a family to worry financially, to work hard simply to make it, and to do without essentials.
  Obama was born to a teenage mother, abandoned by his father at age two, and raised largely in a small apartment by his middle-class grandparents. At one point, Obama, his mother and younger sister relied on food stamps to put meals on the family table.
  Michelle Obama, close counselor and best friend to her husband, and her brother were similarly raised in modest circumstances in a one-bedroom apartment on the south side of Chicago.
  Both Barack and Michelle Obama speak frequently about what it means for middle-class Americans to be at a disadvantage financially and otherwise.
  Because they 'get' it, both Obamas refer with heartfelt eloquence to middle-class fears, including to:
  When cornered by Pastor Rick Warren several months ago, John McCain defined 'rich' as ' I think if you're just talking about income, how about 5 million.'
  Middle-class anger is palpable about economic fairness in these unusually tough financial times, and subsequent to what many view as President Bush's $700 billion bailout of rich Wall Streeters, .
  Obama offered actual, understandable policy solutions to help middle-class Americans, including:
  The American public is fed-up with failed Bush/McCain economics, which claim that prosperity will eventually 'trickle down' to everyone else.
  Obama won the presidential race largely because voters correctly perceive that he, and not John McCain, care about and will address middle-class economic struggles and inequities.
  Reason #2 - Steady Leadership and Calm Temperament
  As of October 21, 2008, Barack Obama earned more than 120 newspaper endorsements, versus 33 for John McCain.
  Without exception, every Obama endorsement referred to his presidential-like personal and leadership qualities. And all echo the same basics about Obama's calm, steady, thoughtful nature, versus McCain's impetuousness and unpredictability.
  Explained The Salt Lake Tribune , which has rarely endorsed a Democrat for president:
  'Under the most intense scrutiny and attacks from both parties, Obama has shown the temperament, judgment, intellect and political acumen that are essential in a president that would lead the United States out of the crises created by President Bush, a complicit Congress and our own apathy.'
  Summed The Los Angeles Times : 'We need a leader who demonstrates thoughtful calm and grace under pressure, one not prone to volatile gesture or capricious pronouncement...
  as the presidential race draws to its conclusion, it is Obama's character and temperament that come to the fore. It is his steadiness. His maturity.'
  And from The Chicago Tribune , founded in 1847, which has never before endorsed a Democrat for the presidency: 'We have tremendous confidence in his intellectual rigor, his moral compass and his ability to make sound, thoughtful, careful decisions. He is ready...
  'Obama is deeply grounded in the best aspirations of this country, and we need to return to those aspirations.... He has risen with his honor, grace and civility intact. He has the intelligence to understand the grave economic and national security risks that face us, to listen to good advice and make careful decisions.'
  In contrast, during the past two months of the '08 presidential campaign, John McCain acted (and overreacted) inconsistently, unpredictably, and without forethought. Two examples of McCain's unsteady leadership were his erratic behavior during the financial markets meltdown, and in his poorly-vetted pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate.
  John McCain served as the perfect foil to highlight Obama's solidly grounded leadership skills.
  Obama's even-keel temperament made him seem well-suited to be President for these troubled, turbulent times.
  And the mere image of ultra-volatile, careless John McCain in the White House was enough to scare the majority of the electorate into supporting Obama.
  Reason #3 - Fair, Cost-Effective Health Care Insurance
  Americans were finally fed-up enough with the unfairness of health care delivery in this country, to be ready to make the issue a priority in selecting a president.
  The U.S. is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system. As a result, in 2008, more than 48 million U.S. men, women and children have no health care insurance.
  Despite being ranked #1 in health care spending by the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. was ranked 72nd among 191 nations in 2000 in overall level of health of its citizens. And the state of U.S. health care has deteriorated further under the Bush administration.
  Barack Obama's health care plan and policies will fairly ensure that every American will have access to good quality medical care services.
  John McCain's health care plan was a stunningly radical scheme that will:
  Obama's Health Care Plan
  Briefly, Obama will make available a new plan to all Americans, including the self-employed and small businesses, to buy affordable health coverage that is similar to the plan available to members of Congress. The new plan will include:
  Employers that do not offer or make a significant contribution to the cost of quality health coverage for their employees will be required to contribute a percentage of payroll toward the costs of this plan.
  Most small businesses will be exempt from this mandate.
  The Obama plan requires only that all children have health care coverage.
  McCain's Health Care Plan
  John McCain's health care plan was designed to control health care costs and to deregulate, and thus enrich, the health care industry, and is not necessarily designed to offer health care coverage to the uninsured.
  For consumers, the McCain plan:
  Newsweek reported , 'The Tax Policy Center estimates that 20 million workers will leave the employer-based system, not always voluntarily . Midsize and smaller companies are likely to drop their plans... '
  CNN/Money added , 'McCain sorely lacks a plan for people in their 50s without corporate benefits, and Americans with pre-existing conditions, who would be brutally stripped of coverage if insurance crosses state lines.'
  Observed blogger Jim MacDonald , 'The result... won’t be healthy competition that will lower costs for everyone. It’ll be higher costs and fewer options for the poor, the old, and the sick. That is, the people who need health care. Young, healthy, rich people won’t be affected... '
  Obama's Plan: The Only Viable Choice
  In summary, Obama's plan, in which long-time health care advocate Hillary Clinton will be deeply involved, will fairly and inexpensively ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care services, but without the government providing those services.
  McCain's so-called health care plan was intended to free the business community from providing for its employees, to enrich the health care insurance industry, and increase income taxes for all Americans. But not to provide health care services for the uninsured.
  For anyone who valued their health care insurance, Barack Obama was the only viable choice for president.
  Reason #4 - Withdrawal of Combat Troops from Iraq
  Barack Obama bested Hillary Clinton by a small margin for the '08 Democratic presidential nomination due mainly to their differing positions on the Iraq War, especially at the war's inception in 2002.
  Sen. Hillary Clinton voted YES in 2002 to give the Bush administration authorization to attack and invade Iraq. Sen. Clinton rightfully believes that Congress was misled by Bush, and after a while, she admitted her regret for her vote.
  But Clinton's 2002 support for the unpopular war was brutal fact.
  In contrast, Barack Obama famously spoke out in late 2002 against the Iraq War before Congress voted, declaring:
  'I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt...
  to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.
  'What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression.'
  Obama on the Iraq War
  Obama's stance on the Iraq War is unambiguous: he plans to immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months.
  Under an Obama administration, the U.S. will not build or maintain any permanent bases in Iraq.
  He of course, plans to temporarily maintain some non-combat troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats, and to complete the training of Iraq troops and police forces, as necessary.
  Also, Obama plans to 'launch the most aggressive diplomatic effort in recent American history to reach a new compact on the stability of Iraq and the Middle East.' This effort will include all of Iraq’s neighbors, including Iran and Syria.
  McCain, a third generation Naval officer, voted in 2002 to give President Bush full authority to attack and invade Iraq. And he's continually served as supporter and cheerleader for the U.S. War in Iraq, albeit with occasional objections to strategies.
  At the '08 Republican Convention and on the campaign trail, McCain and running mate Gov. Palin frequently proclaimed a goal of 'victory in Iraq' and scoff at withdrawal timetables as foolish and premature.
  McCain's website proclaimed '... it is strategically and morally essential for the U.S. to support the Government of Iraq to become capable of governing itself and safeguarding its people. He strongly disagrees with those who advocate withdrawing American troops before that has occurred.'
  McCain took this stance:
  Here's the really odd part : the Bush administration also disagreed with John McCain. Per various international sources on October 20, 2008 , the U.S. is finalizing negotiations on a security agreement with Iraq:
  'The agreement also contains a timetable for the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Iraqi cities and towns by June 30, 2009 and from Iraqi territory by Dec. 31, 2011.'
  Even General David Petraeus, often referred to with great reverence by McCain, recently told the British press that he would never use the word 'victory' to describe U.S. involvement in Iraq and commented :
  'This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.'
  The hard truth is that John McCain, Vietnam War POW, was obsessed with the Iraq War. And he couldn't seem to shake his angry, unhealthy obsession despite either reality or exorbitant cost.
  U.S. Voters Want Out of Iraq
  Per CNN/Opinion Research Corp. polling from October 17 to 19, 2008, 66% of all Americans disapprove of the Iraq war.
  Barack Obama was on the correct side of this issue, per the entire voting public, especially per the centrist, swing voters who decide most election outcomes.
  Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election in part because he consistently exhibited wise judgment on the Iraq War, and because he insists on the obviously correct course of action.
  Reason #5 - Joe Biden as Running Mate
  Sen. Barack Obama won the presidency in part because of his wise selection of highly experienced, well-liked Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as his vice-presidential running mate.
  The first job of the vice president is to assume the presidency should the president become incapacitated. No one doubts that Joe Biden is fully prepared to become President of the United States, should that terrible occasion arise.
  The second job of the vice president is to be of constant counsel to the president. In his 36 years in the U.S. Senate, Biden is one of the most respected American leaders on foreign policy , the U.S. judiciary, crime, civil liberties and many other vital areas.
  For more, see Profile of U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware .
  With his gregarious, warm personality, Biden is suited to offer direct, smart counsel to the 44th president, as he has done for many other U.S. presidents.
  As added bonus, the working chemistry and mutual respect between Obama and Biden is excellent.
  For Americans concerned about Barack Obama's level of experience, Joe Biden's presence on the ticket added a large dose of gravitas.
  Had he selected one of the able, but far less experienced candidates on this short list (Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, to name two top contenders), Barack Obama may have been less likely to reassure a majority of voters that the Democratic ticket was experienced enough to tackle today's tough issues.
  Joe Biden vs. Sarah Palin
  Joe Biden's deep grasp of the issues, appreciation of U.S. history and laws, and steady, experienced leadership were in jarring contrast to that of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice-presidential candidate.
  Republican nominee, 72-year-old John McCain, has wrestled with three episodes of melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and gets an in-depth skin cancer check every few months.
  Mr. McCain's serious health challenges greatly increased the risk that he could become incapacitated and/or pass away in office, which would require his vice president to become President of the United States.
  It was widely recognized, even by a plethora of conservative pundits, that Sarah Palin was wholly unprepared to assume the presidency. (For more, see Sarah Palin in '08: The Good, The Bad & The Very Ugly .)
  In contrast, Joe Biden was widely regarded as well prepared to assume the presidency.
  Due to these five important political factors, Barack Obama won the November 4, 2008 election to become the 44th President of the United States.

"John McCain on the Pledge of Allegiance","http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/usconstitution/a/pledgehist.htm","Brief history of the Pledge of Allegiance","2003-10-15 11:52:47","  By Robert Longley
  The original Pledge of Allegiance, 'I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it stands -- One nation indivisible -- with liberty and justice for all,' was written in September of 1892 by Francis Bellamy for 'The Youth's Companion' magazine in Boston. The phrase was printed on leaflets and sent to schools throughout the United States.
  The first organized use of the Pledge of Allegiance came on Oct. 12, 1892, when some 12 million American school children recited it to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus .
  In 1923, the first National Flag Conference in Washington D.C . voted to change the words 'my flag' to 'the Flag of the United States of America.'
  The U.S. Congress officially recognized the Pledge of Allegiance in 1942, but in 1943, the Supreme Court ruled that public school students could not be forced to recite it.
  The words 'under God' were added in 1954 by then President Eisenhower , who stated at the time, 'In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.'
  'I pledge allegiance to the Flag, of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, One Nation under God Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.'

"John McCain's Sons","http://usliberals.about.com/od/obamavsmccainin08/a/McCainLoss.htm","Five Reasons Why Obama Won the '08 Election","2008-10-19 22:41:43","  Barack Obama decisively won the presidential election, for many solid reasons and due to many factors, including weaknesses of his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain.
  This article enumerates and explains five top reasons why Obama won win the 2008 race to become the 44th President of the United States.
  Reason #1 - Empathy and Genuine Help for Middle-Class Americans
  Barack Obama 'gets' what it means for a family to worry financially, to work hard simply to make it, and to do without essentials.
  Obama was born to a teenage mother, abandoned by his father at age two, and raised largely in a small apartment by his middle-class grandparents. At one point, Obama, his mother and younger sister relied on food stamps to put meals on the family table.
  Michelle Obama, close counselor and best friend to her husband, and her brother were similarly raised in modest circumstances in a one-bedroom apartment on the south side of Chicago.
  Both Barack and Michelle Obama speak frequently about what it means for middle-class Americans to be at a disadvantage financially and otherwise.
  Because they 'get' it, both Obamas refer with heartfelt eloquence to middle-class fears, including to:
  When cornered by Pastor Rick Warren several months ago, John McCain defined 'rich' as ' I think if you're just talking about income, how about 5 million.'
  Middle-class anger is palpable about economic fairness in these unusually tough financial times, and subsequent to what many view as President Bush's $700 billion bailout of rich Wall Streeters, .
  Obama offered actual, understandable policy solutions to help middle-class Americans, including:
  The American public is fed-up with failed Bush/McCain economics, which claim that prosperity will eventually 'trickle down' to everyone else.
  Obama won the presidential race largely because voters correctly perceive that he, and not John McCain, care about and will address middle-class economic struggles and inequities.
  Reason #2 - Steady Leadership and Calm Temperament
  As of October 21, 2008, Barack Obama earned more than 120 newspaper endorsements, versus 33 for John McCain.
  Without exception, every Obama endorsement referred to his presidential-like personal and leadership qualities. And all echo the same basics about Obama's calm, steady, thoughtful nature, versus McCain's impetuousness and unpredictability.
  Explained The Salt Lake Tribune , which has rarely endorsed a Democrat for president:
  'Under the most intense scrutiny and attacks from both parties, Obama has shown the temperament, judgment, intellect and political acumen that are essential in a president that would lead the United States out of the crises created by President Bush, a complicit Congress and our own apathy.'
  Summed The Los Angeles Times : 'We need a leader who demonstrates thoughtful calm and grace under pressure, one not prone to volatile gesture or capricious pronouncement...
  as the presidential race draws to its conclusion, it is Obama's character and temperament that come to the fore. It is his steadiness. His maturity.'
  And from The Chicago Tribune , founded in 1847, which has never before endorsed a Democrat for the presidency: 'We have tremendous confidence in his intellectual rigor, his moral compass and his ability to make sound, thoughtful, careful decisions. He is ready...
  'Obama is deeply grounded in the best aspirations of this country, and we need to return to those aspirations.... He has risen with his honor, grace and civility intact. He has the intelligence to understand the grave economic and national security risks that face us, to listen to good advice and make careful decisions.'
  In contrast, during the past two months of the '08 presidential campaign, John McCain acted (and overreacted) inconsistently, unpredictably, and without forethought. Two examples of McCain's unsteady leadership were his erratic behavior during the financial markets meltdown, and in his poorly-vetted pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate.
  John McCain served as the perfect foil to highlight Obama's solidly grounded leadership skills.
  Obama's even-keel temperament made him seem well-suited to be President for these troubled, turbulent times.
  And the mere image of ultra-volatile, careless John McCain in the White House was enough to scare the majority of the electorate into supporting Obama.
  Reason #3 - Fair, Cost-Effective Health Care Insurance
  Americans were finally fed-up enough with the unfairness of health care delivery in this country, to be ready to make the issue a priority in selecting a president.
  The U.S. is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system. As a result, in 2008, more than 48 million U.S. men, women and children have no health care insurance.
  Despite being ranked #1 in health care spending by the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. was ranked 72nd among 191 nations in 2000 in overall level of health of its citizens. And the state of U.S. health care has deteriorated further under the Bush administration.
  Barack Obama's health care plan and policies will fairly ensure that every American will have access to good quality medical care services.
  John McCain's health care plan was a stunningly radical scheme that will:
  Obama's Health Care Plan
  Briefly, Obama will make available a new plan to all Americans, including the self-employed and small businesses, to buy affordable health coverage that is similar to the plan available to members of Congress. The new plan will include:
  Employers that do not offer or make a significant contribution to the cost of quality health coverage for their employees will be required to contribute a percentage of payroll toward the costs of this plan.
  Most small businesses will be exempt from this mandate.
  The Obama plan requires only that all children have health care coverage.
  McCain's Health Care Plan
  John McCain's health care plan was designed to control health care costs and to deregulate, and thus enrich, the health care industry, and is not necessarily designed to offer health care coverage to the uninsured.
  For consumers, the McCain plan:
  Newsweek reported , 'The Tax Policy Center estimates that 20 million workers will leave the employer-based system, not always voluntarily . Midsize and smaller companies are likely to drop their plans... '
  CNN/Money added , 'McCain sorely lacks a plan for people in their 50s without corporate benefits, and Americans with pre-existing conditions, who would be brutally stripped of coverage if insurance crosses state lines.'
  Observed blogger Jim MacDonald , 'The result... won’t be healthy competition that will lower costs for everyone. It’ll be higher costs and fewer options for the poor, the old, and the sick. That is, the people who need health care. Young, healthy, rich people won’t be affected... '
  Obama's Plan: The Only Viable Choice
  In summary, Obama's plan, in which long-time health care advocate Hillary Clinton will be deeply involved, will fairly and inexpensively ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care services, but without the government providing those services.
  McCain's so-called health care plan was intended to free the business community from providing for its employees, to enrich the health care insurance industry, and increase income taxes for all Americans. But not to provide health care services for the uninsured.
  For anyone who valued their health care insurance, Barack Obama was the only viable choice for president.
  Reason #4 - Withdrawal of Combat Troops from Iraq
  Barack Obama bested Hillary Clinton by a small margin for the '08 Democratic presidential nomination due mainly to their differing positions on the Iraq War, especially at the war's inception in 2002.
  Sen. Hillary Clinton voted YES in 2002 to give the Bush administration authorization to attack and invade Iraq. Sen. Clinton rightfully believes that Congress was misled by Bush, and after a while, she admitted her regret for her vote.
  But Clinton's 2002 support for the unpopular war was brutal fact.
  In contrast, Barack Obama famously spoke out in late 2002 against the Iraq War before Congress voted, declaring:
  'I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt...
  to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.
  'What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression.'
  Obama on the Iraq War
  Obama's stance on the Iraq War is unambiguous: he plans to immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months.
  Under an Obama administration, the U.S. will not build or maintain any permanent bases in Iraq.
  He of course, plans to temporarily maintain some non-combat troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats, and to complete the training of Iraq troops and police forces, as necessary.
  Also, Obama plans to 'launch the most aggressive diplomatic effort in recent American history to reach a new compact on the stability of Iraq and the Middle East.' This effort will include all of Iraq’s neighbors, including Iran and Syria.
  McCain, a third generation Naval officer, voted in 2002 to give President Bush full authority to attack and invade Iraq. And he's continually served as supporter and cheerleader for the U.S. War in Iraq, albeit with occasional objections to strategies.
  At the '08 Republican Convention and on the campaign trail, McCain and running mate Gov. Palin frequently proclaimed a goal of 'victory in Iraq' and scoff at withdrawal timetables as foolish and premature.
  McCain's website proclaimed '... it is strategically and morally essential for the U.S. to support the Government of Iraq to become capable of governing itself and safeguarding its people. He strongly disagrees with those who advocate withdrawing American troops before that has occurred.'
  McCain took this stance:
  Here's the really odd part : the Bush administration also disagreed with John McCain. Per various international sources on October 20, 2008 , the U.S. is finalizing negotiations on a security agreement with Iraq:
  'The agreement also contains a timetable for the withdrawal of the U.S. military from Iraqi cities and towns by June 30, 2009 and from Iraqi territory by Dec. 31, 2011.'
  Even General David Petraeus, often referred to with great reverence by McCain, recently told the British press that he would never use the word 'victory' to describe U.S. involvement in Iraq and commented :
  'This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan.'
  The hard truth is that John McCain, Vietnam War POW, was obsessed with the Iraq War. And he couldn't seem to shake his angry, unhealthy obsession despite either reality or exorbitant cost.
  U.S. Voters Want Out of Iraq
  Per CNN/Opinion Research Corp. polling from October 17 to 19, 2008, 66% of all Americans disapprove of the Iraq war.
  Barack Obama was on the correct side of this issue, per the entire voting public, especially per the centrist, swing voters who decide most election outcomes.
  Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election in part because he consistently exhibited wise judgment on the Iraq War, and because he insists on the obviously correct course of action.

"Judge Forbids Black Mothers from Naming Own Children","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/a/baby_names.htm","Child Witnesses Honest, But Less Reliable","2005-05-21 01:21:57","  By Charles Montaldo
  Children testifying in court are perceived to be more honest than adults, but their limited memory, communication skills, and greater suggestibility may make them less reliable witnesses than adults.
  The multi-disciplinary researc h, the first of its kind to examine judges' perceptions of child witnesses, was led by Queen's University Child and Family Law scholar Nick Bala. It addresses how judges assess the honesty and reliability of children's court testimony, and how accurate their observations are. It also makes recommendations for how to train child protection professionals and judges to most effectively frame their questions to child witnesses.
  The research has important implications for educating child-protection professionals, including judges.
  The findings are based on two related studies that merge traditional legal scholarship on children's truth telling, and a national survey of child-protection professionals that assesses perceptions of child witnesses and truth telling, with judges' responses to mock interviews.
  'Assessing the credibility of witnesses; deciding how much to rely on their testimony; is central to the trial process,' says Bala. 'The assessment of credibility is an inherently human and imprecise enterprise.“
  The research showed that social workers, other professionals working in child protection, and judges correctly identify children who are lying at only slightly above chance levels after watching mock interviews . Judges perform comparably to other justice system officials and significantly better than law students.
  Children Face Disadvantages
  While the mock interviews don't replicate the judge's courtroom experience, 'the results show that judges are not human lie detectors,' says Bala.
  The research also indicates that defense lawyers are more likely than prosecutors or others who work in the court system to ask children questions that are not appropriate to their developmental level. These questions use vocabulary, grammar or concepts that children could not reasonably be expected to understand. This leaves child witnesses at a disadvantage to respond honestly .
  Less Likely to Deceive
  The survey asked Canadian judges about their perceptions of child and adult witnesses on such issues as suggestibility, leading questions, memory, and perceptions of honesty in child witnesses. It found that children are perceived as:
  According to psychological research, Bala summarizes that a child's memory improves with age. For example, at age four, children can accurately describe what happened to them as far back as two years. Also, even though older children and adults have better memories, they are more likely to give inaccurate information when recalling past events compared younger children.
  Bala's research also suggests that children and adults provide more details when asked specific questioned rather than open-ended questions. However, children usually try to answer these types of questions, by giving answers to the parts of the question that they understand . When this occurs, the child's answers could seem misleading.
  Using this knowledge to refine techniques when questioning children can help improve the accuracy and completeness of a child's answer. Bala says such techniques include, 'showing warmth and support to children, mimicking the vocabulary of the child, avoiding legal jargon, confirming meanings of words with children, limiting the use of yes/no questions and avoiding of abstract conceptual questions.'
  It is also interesting to point out that when older children are repeatedly asked about an event, they tend to try to improve their description or provide additional information. However, younger children often assume being asked the same question means that their answer was wrong, so they sometimes change their answer entirely.
  Funded by The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the research suggests that all new judges should be trained in how children should be questioned, and about the types of questions that children should be able to understand.
  Effective communication with children and developmentally appropriate questions which children can reasonably be expected to answer makes them far more reliable witnesses.
  To minimize the deterioration in children's memories, the delay between the reporting of an offense and the trial should be shortened, the study also recommends. Several meetings between a child witness and the prosecutor before testifying will also help minimize a child's anxiety, the study notes.

  Example: Email contributed by Cheryl T., Nov. 30, 2009:
  Analysis: Though based on an actual passage written by former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, this text bears scant resemblance to the original , which appeared as the first chapter of Where Have All the Leaders Gone? , a book by Iacocca and Catherine Whitney published by Simon & Schuster in 2007.
  In brief, what originated as a sharp critique of President George W.
  Bush, his policies, and administration has been anonymously revised to make it appear as though Iacocca blames Barack Obama and the Democrats for all the country's ills.
  For example, the original text, as written by Iacocca, begins like so:
  The same passage, as anonymously altered for Internet consumption, reads as follows:
  And so on. When Iacocca wrote 'Throw the bums out!' he was referring to the Bush administration, not Obama and the Democrats. In fact, when the book was published Obama had only recently announced his candidacy. This is what Iacocca wrote of Barack Obama then:
  No doubt Mr. Iacocca would have a few critical things to say of Obama now that he's been in office for over a year. Perhaps some of those criticisms would even be harsh. We don't know, because Iacocca has made very few public statements about politics since the 2008 election. What we do know is that none of the statements about Obama attributed to Iacocca in the email were actually made by him, though someone seems awfully keen on convincing us that they were.

  Subject: Fw: Life is tough for the poor.....
  Found in a parking lot of a grocery store Menominee, Michigan
  Need I say more about Government Giveaway Abuse?
  Analysis: The management of Angeli's Country Market in Menominee, Michigan has confirmed the authenticity of a customer receipt showing that $141.78 worth of lobster, porterhouse steak and Diet Mountain Dew were purchased by an individual using a Bridge Card (the electronic benefits card issued to food stamp recipients in Michigan) on Feb. 8, 2011.
  Since Michigan law defines 'eligible food' for the government assistance program as 'Any food or food product intended for human consumption except alcoholic beverages, tobacco and foods prepared for immediate consumption,' the purchase itself was not illegal. But because steak and lobster are generally regarded as luxury foods, the transaction has been condemned in some quarters as an instance of welfare abuse.
  Indeed, it's such a stereotypical example of welfare abuse — 'Everyone knows of someone (or knows someone who knows someone) who was in line behind a welfare person using food stamps, and observed him or her purchasing frozen dinners or steaks or lobster or some such,' complained author Michael Murray in 1997 — that skeptics initially wondered if the Menominee incident actually took place.
  It did.
  Still, on the face of it the case does seem too flagrant and over the top to be true, and now we know why. According to the Menominee County Sheriff's Department, local and state investigators have discovered that the reason the cardholder bought such large quantities of lobster, steak, and soda was not to 'dine like a king,' as some have characterized it, but to resell them for profit. And that is illegal.
  The accused, one Louis Cuff, has been charged with welfare fraud and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

  I hope other retailers take a clue from Cabela's .
  The 2.3% Medical Excise Tax that began on January 1st is supposed to be 'hidden' from the consumer, but it's been brought to the public’s attention by hunting and fishing store Cabela's who have refused to hide it and are showing it as a separate line item tax on their receipts.
  Analysis: The image above is one of several scanned receipts in circulation showing that customers of Cabela's sporting goods stores in several states were charged a 'medical excise tax' on goods purchased on Jan. 1, 2013.
  The surcharges were a mistake , a Cabela's spokesperson told the World-Herald News Service on Jan. 9. He blamed the error on 'a glitch in the system' and said all customers subjected to the charge would receive a full refund.
  A Medical Device Excise Tax did go into effect Jan. 1, 2013
  A 2.3% medical device excise tax imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ('Obamacare') did, in fact, take effect as of Jan. 1, 2013, but according to the IRS it does not apply to consumer purchases: 'Because the tax is imposed upon the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer or importer, the manufacturer or importer is responsible for reporting and paying the tax .'
  In addition, the law provides for what is called a 'retail exemption,' meaning items such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, and 'other devices that are of a type that are generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use' are exempt from the medical device excise tax.
  Concerning IRS Publication 510
  Don't be misled by claims that a certain Internal Revenue Service document, IRS Publication 510: Excise Taxes , 'proves' that sporting goods are subject to a medical excise tax under Obamacare. It doesn't. While you will indeed find items such as sport fishing equipment and bows and arrows listed as taxable in Chapter 5 of the publication, along with coal, tires, and gas-guzzling vehicles, none of these are categorized as medical device excise taxes. In fact, every one of these items was subject to federal excise taxes long before the Affordable Care Act was introduced in Congress.

  But she wasn't willing to live with the threat hanging over her head.
  Sophie has told very few friends and relatives about what she's done, partly because her privacy is important to her and partly because she knows reactions may vary. In a culture where many women choose lumpectomy instead of mastectomy to keep their breasts intact, she understands how painful and difficult a decision like this can be.
  In her own words, Sophie explains why she chose a double mastectomy and how it's changed her life.
  My sister and I both grew up under the “breast cancer” cloud. Our mother was diagnosed at age 34 and died at 41. The knowledge that breast cancer could be hereditary was with me 24/7.
  I know other women growing up with a family history of breast cancer feel the same way. You know what your legacy is, but because you're in your twenties you still feel immune. However, every form you fill out, every interview you have in the examining room, your family history looms large. Nobody wants to take any chances with you.
  It wasn't until my 30th birthday - when I had my baseline mammogram and my chart had the stamp of “family history”- that the fear began.
  The grief of my mother's loss, and the knowledge that it was due to breast cancer had always been present in my life. But once I turned 30 and became a mother, the fear kicked in. I had so much more to lose now. I didn't want to leave my children motherless as I had been.
  Each year I had annual mammograms and extra exams by a surgeon.
  Extra precautions were taken including many biopsies that turned up nothing but frayed nerves. The mammograms were especially unnerving. 'Seek and you shall find,' I thought...and worried. Each year as I sat in my gown waiting to be told I could get dressed and no more “views” were needed, I thought, 'This could be it—the year it happens to me.'
  When I was 36 I decided to take the test for the breast cancer gene: BRCA 1 & 2. It was a simple blood test. I paid around $1,000 out of pocket. I made a deal with myself. If the genetic test came back negative I would let myself off the hook. I would continue to be vigilant about early detection but I wouldn’t identify so much with every woman’s sad breast cancer story. I would try to remind myself that I wasn’t doomed and breast cancer wasn’t coming to get me as it had my mother. We didn’t know if my mother carried the gene but if I tested negative I would assume (or pretend) that I was in the general female population and maybe a diagnosis of breast cancer was not my fate.
  The test came back negative. I cried with relief. I knew from my research that hereditary breast cancers were actually the minority of cases but l I was still relieved in a big way that I didn’t carry the breast cancer gene.
  The black cloud dissipated for a few years. But then it came back with a vengeance.
  My sister was diagnosed with pre-menopausal breast cancer at age 48. It was a nightmare but on some level we knew it was coming.
  That’s just how it feels when you live under the cloud.
  My sister had a double mastectomy, chemo, radiation, hair loss—the works.
  'Okay,' I thought. 'Time to make another deal with myself.' I asked my sister to undergo genetic testing. I reasoned that if she tested positive for the breast cancer gene I could let myself off the hook big time since I tested negative. I could assume it was hereditary and I escaped.
  If she tested negative I would assume it does run in our family and they just haven’t identified the genetic code for this kind of aggressive familial breast cancer. In that case I would have a prophylactic double mastectomy.
  She tested negative.
  I knew I was next.
  And finally, that was what led me to this decision.
  For years, I'd thought about having a prophylactic double mastectomy and wondered what compelling thing would have to happen in my life for me to do it. If any biopsy came back positive...when I heard of new people being diagnosed...I thought about what I'd do.
  Since a close family member was an oncologist, I knew about every different circumstance and all the possibilities and options out there.
  When I heard what other people had done and how they took different approaches, I remember thinking, 'If that had been me, that breast would have come off.'
  So when my sister was diagnosed - and the genetic testing showed we were both negative for the breast cancer gene -I opted to have my breasts removed.
  I’ve heard people, including some doctors, say that having two healthy breasts removed in the name of prevention is a radical step. Not for me.
  I realize there might have been a possibility that I'd never develop breast cancer.
  But it's not about statistics - it's about how you feel inside. It gets to the point that you just don't want this hanging over your head anymore.
  I was married, had my children and was ready to say good-bye to my two anxiety provoking appendages.
  To be perfectly honest, I was more afraid of the enormity of the mastectomy and reconstruction process than sad over losing my breasts. I’ve always been a baby about medical procedures and this whole thing seemed too bad to be true.
  I had to find a general surgeon to remove the breasts and then find a plastic surgeon to work side-by-side with him to start the reconstruction process.
  If you opt to have reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy you need to have “expanders” placed behind the chest muscle and have saline injected into the “expanders” every few weeks until you have reached your desired breast size.
  Then you have another surgery where the permanent implants replace the expanders.
  So I did all that, but I kept it a secret from nearly everyone except a few close friends. It was a personal decision that I didn’t want to discuss for several reasons, the main one being personal privacy.
  Breasts are a private part that we keep hidden from the public. I had a large chest growing up and when I was younger, guys stared at it and I was never flattered - I felt uncomfortable. Once I had the double mastectomy, I didn't want to be the object of curiosity. I didn't want to invite more people to stare at my reconstructed chest.
  There are a couple of positives that the implants offer. Because I was large chested, the shoulder straps of my bras always dug into my shoulders. If I wanted any support, I had to wear uncomfortable underwire bras that I would always take off the minute I got home. With implants, you don't need to wear a bra, thus no more uncomfortable straps. Another benefit is that your breasts are now firm and perky. No more 'National Geographic Hanging Breast' syndrome - I finally had more than a few inches between my belly button and the bottom of my breasts. It makes you look younger and thinner.
  Still, it's not worth the trade. The first year, every time I went to roll on my side in bed at night, I woke up from the pain. There was the healing process, and there was soreness.
  I discovered there isn’t any real support for women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy. The support goes to the women who are having the surgery because of a cancer diagnosis, and rightly so. They have a lot more challenges ahead of them than I did.
  My plastic surgeon’s office offered very little information of any kind. I had to call them the day before the surgery to ask what I should bring to wear home from the hospital.
  I had no idea what to expect. The only information came from a 5 minute video I saw in the office that detailed the surgical procedure. The film was geared toward breast cancer patients.
  They didn't give me any guidance or support, or explain all the things I should be doing to make healing easier. Technically, my surgeon did a good job but I had no idea of what to expect afterwards.
  Keeping it a secret makes it more difficult to get first-hand information and advice. If you join a breast cancer support group you have any number of people to help you with the process. While you're in the hospital, a survivor visits you and provides support. But if you're not a survivor and you keep it a secret, you miss out on that support.
  Because I didn’t share my situation I did not have a ‘community’ of people helping me. I traded emotional support and casseroles for privacy.
  My plastic surgeon was technically proficient but a real jerk. He inserted implants that were not the size I asked for. They were huge and too big for my frame. I had to wait three months and have the implant surgery redone by someone else.
  During that time I googled answers to my many questions, relying on a few excellent plastic surgery websites that offered detailed information.
  At the time I did this, all the plastic surgery-based TV reality shows were big hits. You could see surgeons reshaping imperfections. I couldn't help but compare those TV results to my misshapen results -an end product that even doctors themselves admit falls short of what reconstructive breast surgery should be able to achieve.
  Although these shows provided a glimpse of what goes on, every woman who's undergone reconstructive surgery at the time of her mastectomy knows it's a lengthy and challenging medical procedure. And afterwards, I couldn't complain to my doctors about the outcome. The surgeon who inserted the too-large implants was very dismissive when I asked about the cosmetic results, saying to me, 'Be thankful that you don't have cancer.'
  However, the relief in not having any breasts far outweighed anything else.
  My children were too young to understand what was going on, so I simply said I was going to be in the hospital for a few days. I explained, 'Because Mommy's sister just had breast cancer and Mommy doesn't want to get it, they have invented a special operation where they scoop out the insides of Mommy's breast and give me a new inside so I won't get cancer.' They just accepted what I said and we didn't talk about it all that much.
  I know what I went through as a young woman with a family history, so I would hate to pass on to a daughter the continuing worry of breast cancer. There's a feeling of doom that you internalize. I've had friends whose mothers also faced breast cancer and beat it. Our lives are so different. Their story isn't one that has a sad, sad ending. For a girl watching her mother die, it has a unique and profound effect on her and her life forever. For them, it's not on the front burner as it was for me.
  I read an article recently where a woman had a prophylactic double mastectomy and the doctor himself tried to talk her out of it, telling her it was a drastic measure and she really didn't need to do it. The woman said, 'They don't know what it's like walking around knowing that they may soon get breast cancer.' The removal of your breasts takes away that risk.
  If I were brave, I would have ridden it out. I wasn't brave - I was aggressive. My level of worry was escalating every year and I just couldn't live with the tension. Yet I can see how other people wouldn't make the choice that I made.
  If I were brave, I wouldn't have to eliminate the unknown fear. But I was scared and tired of being vigilant. The relief that I experience from not having the threat and worry of breast cancer hanging over my head far outweighs any hardship I experienced medically and emotionally.
  Today, I think nothing of these implants and I don't think of myself harboring a big secret.
  I don't worry about anyone's opinion of what I did. It isn't a matter of right or wrong. I saw it with such clarity - it was the best thing for me to do. And with all of it behind me, and the overwhelming fear no longer present in my life, I truly have no regrets.

  Attorney Hillary Rodham Clinton was born in Chicago and educated at Vassar College and Yale Law School. She served in 1974 as counsel on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee which was considering impeachment of then-President Richard Nixon. She married William Jefferson Clinton. She used her name Hillary Rodham through Clinton's first term as governor of Arkansas, then changed it to Hillary Rodham Clinton when he ran for reelection.
  She was First Lady during Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001). Hillary Clinton managed the failed effort to seriously reform health care, she was the target of investigators and rumors for her involvement in the Whitewater scandal, and she defended and stood by her husband when he was accused and impeached during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
  Near the end of her husband's term as President, Hillary Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York, taking office in 2001 and winning reelection in 2006. She unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, and was appointed Secretary of State in 2009, serving until 2013.

  In too many instances, the march to globalization has also meant the marginalization of women and girls. And that must change.
  If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card, then deal me in!
  Our country’s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?
  So don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We’re not. Don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don’t believe anyone who says: “I alone can fix it.”
  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.
  Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. Happy for boys and men, too – because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit. So let’s keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves. Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.
  But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.
  My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States, from my first day in office to my last!
  I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.
  I believe that our economy isn’t working the way it should because our democracy isn’t working the way it should.
  It’s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.
  I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.
  He spoke for 70-odd minutes – and I do mean odd.
  In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.
  Ask yourself: Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump can’t even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he’s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he’s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
  I can’t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started – not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men – the ones moved by fear and pride.
  Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.
  I’m not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment. I’m not here to take away your guns. I just don’t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place.
  So let’s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
  Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger. None of us can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we’ll ever pull together again. But I’m here to tell you tonight – progress is possible.

  Analysis: It's true that if you include the White House Social Secretary and the various deputies to that position, First Lady Michelle Obama oversees a paid staff of at least 22 people , according to the 2009 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff .
  That's as compared to Laura Bush's staff of 18 during the final year of the G.W. Bush administration (2008). In other words, under Michelle Obama the size of the First Lady's staff grew about 20% over that of her predecessor.
  It's disingenuous to describe this as 'unprecedented.'
  It's equally disingenuous to refer to the members of Michelle Obama's staff as 'attendants.'
  But that's politics, isn't it? Carry on.

  Subject: MILITARY DEATHS FOR TWENTY YEARS--- Bet you didn't know the following!  I surely did not.. Military losses for 20 years These are some rather eye-opening facts: Since the start of the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan, the sacrifice has been enormous. In the time period from the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 through now, we have lost over 3000 military personnel to enemy action and accidents. As tragic as the loss of any member of the US Armed Forces is, consider the following statistics:  The annual fatalities of military members while actively serving in the armed forces from 1980 through 2006: >> 1980 ......... 2,392 >> 1981 ......... 2,380 >> 1984 ......... 1,999 >> 1988 ......... 1,819 >> 1989 ......... 1,636 >> 1990 ......... 1,508 >> 1991 ......... 1,787 >> 1992 ......... 1,293 --------------------------- >> 1993 ......... 1,213 >> 1994 ......... 1,075 >> 1995 ......... 2,465 >> 1996 ......... 2,318  Clinton years @13,417 deaths >> 1997 .........    817 >> 1998 ......... 2,252 >> 1999 ......... 1,984 --------------------------- >> 2000 ......... 1,983 >> 2001 .........    890 >> 2002 ......... 1,007  7 BUSH years @9,016 deaths >> 2003 ......... 1,410 >> 2004 ......... 1,887 >> 2005 .........    919 >> 2006 .........    920 --------------------------- If you are confused when you look at these figures... so was I. Do these figures mean that the loss from the two latest conflicts in the Middle East are LESS than the loss of military personnel during Mr. Clinton 's  presidency; when America wasn't even involved in a war? And, I was even more confused; when I read that in 1980, during the reign of President (Nobel Peace Prize) Jimmy Carter, there were 2,392 US military fatalities! These figures indicate that many of our Media & Politicians will pick and choose.  They present only those 'facts' which support their agenda-driven reporting. Why do so many of them march in lock-step to twist the truth. Where do so many of them get their marching-orders for their agenda? Our Mainstream Print and TV media, and many Politicians like to slant; that these brave men and women, who are losing their lives in Iraq, are mostly minorities!  Wrong AGAIN--- just one more media lie! The latest census, of Americans, shows the following distribution of American citizens, by Race: >> European descent (White) ....... 69.12% >> Hispanic ....................... 12.5% >> Black .......................... 12.3% >> Asian ........................... 3.7% >> Native American ................. 1.0% >> Other ........................... 2.6% Now... here are the fatalities by Race; over the past three years in Iraqi Freedom: >> European descent (white) ....... 74.31% >> Hispanic ....................... 10.74% >> Black ........................... 9.67% >> Asian ........................... 1.81% >> Native American ................. 1.9% >> Other ............................ .33% You do the Math! These figures don't lie... but, Media-liars figure... and they sway public opinion!  (These statistics are published by Congressional Research Service, and they may be confirmed by anyone at: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf ) Now ask yourself these two questions: 'Why does the mainstream Print and TV Media never print statistics like these?' and 'Why do the mainstream media hate the web as much as they do?'
  Comments: The claim that there were more U.S. military fatalities during the Bill Clinton administration than there have been to date under George W. Bush is false. Moreover, that erroneous conclusion was based on falsified statistics. Using the actual figures from the Congressional Research Service report cited above, the total military deaths under each of the two administrations are as follows:

  Great Singers Gone too Soon
  Analysis: Notwithstanding the fact that hordes of far-right conspiracy nuts have reprinted the above as factual, it is false. The putative author, 'Michele Chang,' doesn't exist. The actual author, a New York college student named Matthew Avitabile, published the piece on his blog, Jumping in Pools , on January 28, 2009. It was tagged as 'satire,' a detail that fell by the wayside as the text made its way from blog to blog and inbox to inbox in the days that followed. 'Michele Chang is me,' Avitabile confirmed in response to an email query. 'So, yes, it's fake, and it always has been.' Implausible though it must seem to readers with a reasonably firm grip on reality, the central premise — namely that the new administration intends to replace the military's oath of loyalty to the Constitution with a pledge of loyalty to Obama himself — clearly struck a chord with folks who view the President as a shadowy figure with a totalitarian agenda who rose to power via a cult of personality. Several of those who reprinted the article explicitly compared Obama to Adolf Hitler. Though merely implied in the spoof itself, that analogy was intentional, admits the author, who unapologetically describes the piece as 'a creative take on the Wehrmacht pledge in the Third Reich.' No conspiracy theorist himself, he insists, Avitabile says he was surprised to find so many people taking it seriously. 'Not to say that they were dumb, but I think that the tone of a lot of the rumor-spreading was so quick and so urgent that people really wanted to believe it and spread, spread, spread.' Citing the work of radio personality Phil Hendrie as an influence, Avitabile told me he plans to write more satire in the future and will clearly tag it as such in every case — 'if people want to check, that is.' Caveat lector.

  Circulating via email and social media, details of Mitt Romney's participation in efforts to locate and rescue the missing daughter of business colleague Robert Gay in 1996.
  Description: Forwarded email Circulating since: Jan. 2012 Status: True (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by J. Moore, Feb. 2, 2012:
  Subject: Fwd: Mitt Romney's Personality!
  On Romney's character....
  Sometimes, this facet of Romney’s personality isn’t so subtle. In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared. She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay’s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York, and asked them to help find his friend’s missing daughter. Romney’s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could – prostitutes, drug addicts – anyone.
  That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney’s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter’s life, saying, “It was the most amazing thing, and I’ll never forget this to the day I die.”
  So, here’s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can’t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn’t do it for self-aggrandizement, or for personal gain. He does it because that’s just how he’s wired.
  Many people are unaware of the fact that when Romney was asked by his old employer, Bill Bain, to come back to Bain & Company as CEO to rescue the firm from bankruptcy, Romney left Bain Capital to work at Bain & Company for an annual salary of one dollar. When Romney went to the rescue of the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, he accepted no salary for three years, and wouldn’t use an expense account. He also accepted no salary as Governor of Massachusetts.
  Character counts!! (and yes...that's worth reading again!)

  Profile of Mitt Romney
  Analysis: Apart from a dollop of hyperbole and a few minor details that conflict with contemporary press reports (most notably the claim that the missing girl was suffering from serious drug withdrawals and 'might not have survived another day' if she hadn't been found when she was), this account comports with the known facts.
  On the night of July 6, 1996, 14-year-old Melissa Gay, daughter of Bain Capital executive Robert Gay, went missing after attending a late-night rave in New York City. Gay recruited his business partners, including Mitt Romney , and the Boston-based firm's 200 employees to help him conduct a city-wide search.
  'And so I said,' Romney recalled when asked about the incident during a town hall meeting in March 2012, '‘Let’s close the firm, let’s close the company. Let’s all of us fly down to New York and try to find her.’ And so we closed the business, we went home and packed our things, we got a hotel near the airport where we all went to, we set up a headquarters, we met with the detectives with the New York City Police Department, we hired a private investigative firm to help guide us through this process.'
  Gay, Romney, and team literally fanned out on the streets of Manhattan in suits and ties, distributing 300,000 fliers and asking passersby point-blank if they had seen the missing girl. Their efforts quickly paid off in the form of a phone call from a private residence in Montville, New Jersey, where it turned out Melissa was staying with acquaintances. She was retrieved by police and reunited with her parents in the early morning hours of July 12.
  'She's OK,' Robert Gay said in a statement to the Associated Press. 'How can you ask for anything more than that?'
  In a 2008 campaign video for his friend and former business partner, Gay described Romney's role in the rescue effort as follows: 'My business partner stepped forward to take charge. He closed the company and brought almost all our employees to New York. He said, `I don't care how long it takes. We're going to find her.' He set up a command center and searched through the night. The man who helped save my daughter was Mitt Romney.'

"Monica Lewinsky Explains Post-Clinton Weight Loss","http://womensissues.about.com/od/influentialwomen/fl/Monica-Lewinsky-Seeks-to-Set-the-Record-Straight.htm","Monica Lewinsky Sets the Record Straight","2014-05-14 13:02:11","  By Susana Morris
  Monica Lewinsky first burst onto the national scene after her affair with then president Bill Clinton was exposed. Since then, Lewinsky has been at the center of an impeachment trial, the butt of jokes, and the target of intense criticism. She has also largely stayed out of the spotlight until 2014, w she broke her decade-long silence with a Vanity Fair article.
  Monica Samille Lewinsky was born in San Francisco, California in 1973. She was raised in the affluent neighborhoods of Brentwood and Beverly Hills, in Southern California where her father, Bernard Lewinsky, is an oncologist, and her mother, Marcia Kaye Vilensky, is a writer. The Lewinskys divorced when Monica was a teen. After attending Bel Air Prep she attended Santa Monica College and then graduated with a degree in psychology from Lewis and Clark College in 1995. She received her master’s degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics in 2006.
  A more detailed profile of Monica Lewinsky can be found on Biography.com.
  Lewinsky is of course best known for her affair with then President of the United States Bill Clinton that took place between 1995 and 1997, and which was outlined in sordid detail in the Starr report . Immediately after the scandal Lewinsky remained in and out of the spotlight. In 1999, Barbara Walters interviewed Monica Lewinsky on ABC’s 20/20 to over 70 million viewers and Lewinsky was the subject of an authorized biography, “Monica’s Story.” That same year, Lewinsky launched a (now defunct) line of handbags. The next year she had a short-lived stint as a Jenny Craig spokesperson and as a reality TV host in 2003.  Lewinsky went on to complete graduate studies in 2006 and the largely disappeared from the public eye.
  Lewinsky is no longer the intern with the beret and the infamous blue dress. She is a woman who has had to deal with the fallout and the consequences of her dalliance with one of the most powerful men in the world for her entire professional career.
  In a 2014 Vanity Fair article she wrote, “Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position. . . . The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.”
  Lewinsky admits that employment has sometimes been an issue because of her history and that over the years she has not been able to be a completely private citizen, noting, “she is still recognized every day, and her name shows up daily in press clips and pop-culture references.” She even checks Beyoncé’s grammar in the singer’s recent raunchy hit, “Partition,” quipping, “‘Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we’re verbing, I think you meant ‘Bill Clinton’d all on my gown,’ not ‘Monica Lewinsky’d.’”
  Lewinsky has also called out feminists for what she sees as a betrayal. Some feminists like Jessica Bennett agree, noting that “Long before slut-shaming was a term, Monica Lewinsky was its original target.”
  In other words, because of the propensity to blame women in acts of “deviant” sexuality, Lewinsky stood little chance of being understand with complexity or nuance in the popular imagination or even among some mainstream feminists, such as Susan Faludi and Erica Jong.
  Today Lewinsky claims that she is reemerging from the shadows to take control of her own narrative. She wrote in Vanity Fair , “I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I’ve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)”
  It was perhaps no coincidence that Lewinsky was back in the news just as rumors of Hillary Clinton’s run for President began. Perhaps this was indeed Lewinsky’s attempt to recalibrate the conversations that center on her. In Rebecca Traister’s piece in the New Republic she wrote, “in offering a refresher on her own story—one surely intended to sell magazines to Hillary-haters everywhere—Lewinsky is exposing many of the dynamics that have stood so uncomfortably between women and power for so very long.”
  Traister’s comments underscores the ways in which Lewinsky’s most recent attempt at reinvention is catalyzing a much needed conversation about women, sex, and power in the face of what could possibly be the first woman president of the United States.
  Ultimately, Monica Lewinsky’s unapologetic call to take control of her legacy should benefit not just herself, but all women.

"Muslim 'Religion of Peace Demonstration' (Photos)","http://atheism.about.com/od/islammuslims/fl/Is-Islam-Based-on-Peace-Submission-and-Surrender-to-God.htm","Is Islam Based on Peace, Submission, and Surrender to God?","2016-03-17 14:20:30","  By Austin Cline
  Islam isn't just a title or name of a religion, it's also a word in Arabic which is rich in meaning and has many connections to other fundamental Islamic concepts. Understanding the concept of 'Islam,' or 'submission,' is critical to understanding the religion which derives its name from it — not only can it make critiques of Islam better informed, but there are in fact good reasons to critique and question Islam on the basis of the concept of submission to an authoritarian god .
  The Arabic term 'islam means 'submission' and itself comes from the term 'aslama , which means 'to surrender, resign oneself.' In Islam, the fundamental duty of each Muslim is to submit to Allah (Arabic for 'the God') and whatever Allah wants of them. A person who follows Islam is called a Muslim, and this means 'one who surrenders to God.' It is thus clear that the concept of submission to the will, desires, and commands and God is inextricably linked to Islam as a religion — it's an inherent part of the name of the religion, of the religion's followers, and of the basic tenets of Islam .
  When a religion originally develops in a cultural context where total submission to absolute rulers and total submission to the head of a family are taken for granted, it's hardly surprising that this religion would reinforce these cultural values and add on top of them the idea of total submission to a god which stands above all those other authority figures. In modern society where we have learned the importance of equality, universal suffrage, personal autonomy, and democracy, though, such values seem out of place and should be challenged.
  Why is it good or appropriate to 'submit' to a god? Even if we assume that some god exists, it cannot automatically follow that humans have any sort of moral obligation to completely submit or surrender to the will of this god. It certainly can't be argued that the sheer power of such a god creates such an obligation — it might be prudent to submit to a more powerful being, but prudence is not something that can be described as a moral obligation. On the contrary, if humans have to submit or surrender to such a god out of fear of the consequences, it merely reinforces the idea that this god is itself unethical.
  We must also remember the fact that since no gods appear before us to deliver instructions, submission to any 'god' entails on a practical level submission to this god's self-appointed representatives as well as whatever traditions and regulations they create. Many criticize the totalitarian nature of Islam because it seeks to be an all-encompassing ideology which controls every aspect of life: ethics, manners, laws, etc.
  For some atheists , rejection of belief in gods is closely connected with believing that we need to reject all totalitarian rulers as part of the development of human freedom. Mikhail Bakunin, for example, wrote that 'the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice' and that 'if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him.'
  Other religions also teach that the most important value or behavior for believers is to submit to whatever that religion's god wants, and the same criticisms can be made of them. Usually this principle of submission is only made explicit by conservative and fundamentalist believers, but while more liberal and moderate believers may downplay the importance of this principle, none go so far as to teach that it's legitimate to disobey or ignore their god.
  The Arabic word islam is related to the Syriac 'aslem which means 'to make peace, surrender' and that in turn appears to be derived from the Semitic stem of *slem which means 'to be complete.' The Arabic word islam is thus also closely related to the Arabic word for peace, salem . Muslims believe that true peace can only be achieved through true obedience to the will of Allah.
  Critics and observers must not forget, though, that 'peace' here is inextricably intertwined with 'submission' and 'surrender' — specifically to the will, desires, and commands of Allah, but of course also to those who set themselves up as the transmitters, interpreters, and teachers in Islam. Peace is thus not something achieved through mutual respect, compromise, love, or anything similar. Peace is something that exists as a consequence of and in the context of submission or surrender.
  This is not a problem limited solely to Islam. Arabic is a Semitic language and Hebrew, also Semitic, creates the same connections between peace or 'shalom' and submission in the Bible :
  'When you draw near to a town to fight against it, offer it terms of peace. If it accepts your terms of peace and surrenders to you, then all the people in it shall serve you at forced labor.' ( Deuteronomy 20:10-11)
  It makes sense that 'peace' would involve domination in these contexts because God isn't likely to be willing to negotiate and compromise with enemies — but that's what is necessary for there to be a peace based upon mutual respect and equal freedom. The god of the ancient Israelites and of Muslims is an absolutist, totalitarian god with no interest in compromises, negotiations, or dissent. For such a god, the only peace that's needed is a peace achieved through the subjugation of those who oppose him.
  Commitment to Islam is supposed to result in a constant struggle to achieve peace, justice and equality. Many atheists would agree with Bakunin's argument, though, that 'if God is, he is necessarily the eternal, supreme, absolute master, and, if such a master exists, man is a slave; now, if he is a slave, neither justice, nor equality, nor fraternity, nor prosperity are possible for him.' The Muslim conception of god can thus be described as an absolute tyrant, and Islam itself can be described as an ideology designed to teach people to become submissive towards all would-be rulers, from Allah on down.

"My Neighbor, John Edwards","http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcare/a/ObamaHealthInsSpeech.htm","Obama's Health Care Reform Speech to Congress (Full Text)","2009-09-11 15:32:19","  When I spoke here last winter, this nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs per month. Credit was frozen. And our financial system was on the verge of collapse.
  As any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you, we are by no means out of the woods.
  A full and vibrant recovery is many months away. And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them; until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive; until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes.
  That is our ultimate goal. But thanks to the bold and decisive action we have taken since January, I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink.
  I want to thank the members of this body for your efforts and your support in these last several months, and especially those who have taken the difficult votes that have put us on a path to recovery. I also want to thank the American people for their patience and resolve during this trying time for our nation.
  But we did not come here just to clean up crises. We came to build a future. So tonight, I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future – and that is the issue of healthcare.
  I am not the first President to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last. It has now been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt first called for healthcare reform. And ever since, nearly every president and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way.
  A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.
  Our collective failure to meet this challenge – year after year, decade after decade – has led us to a breaking point.
  Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans. Some can’t get insurance on the job.
  Others are self-employed, and can’t afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.
  We are the only advanced democracy on Earth – the only wealthy nation – that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two-year period, one in every three Americans goes without healthcare coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.
  But the problem that plagues the healthcare system is not just a problem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you’ll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won’t pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.
  One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn’t reported gallstones that he didn’t even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.
  By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.
  Then there’s the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on healthcare than any other country, but we aren’t any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It’s why so many employers – especially small businesses – are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely.
  It’s why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally – like our automakers – are at a huge disadvantage. And it’s why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it – about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else’s emergency room and charitable care.
  Finally, our healthcare system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When healthcare costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our healthcare problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.
  These are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform this system. The question is how.
  There are those on the left who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single-payer system like Canada’s, where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone.
  On the right, there are those who argue that we should end the employer-based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own.
  I have to say that there are arguments to be made for both approaches. But either one would represent a radical shift that would disrupt the healthcare most people currently have.
  Since healthcare represents one-sixth of our economy, I believe it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn’t, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch.
  And that is precisely what those of you in Congress have tried to do over the past several months.
  During that time, we have seen Washington at its best and its worst. We have seen many in this chamber work tirelessly for the better part of this year to offer thoughtful ideas about how to achieve reform. Of the five committees asked to develop bills, four have completed their work, and the Senate Finance Committee announced today that it will move forward next week.
  That has never happened before.
  Our overall efforts have been supported by an unprecedented coalition of doctors and nurses; hospitals, seniors’ groups and even drug companies – many of whom opposed reform in the past. And there is agreement in this chamber on about 80% of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.
  But what we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward their own government.
  Instead of honest debate, we have seen scare tactics. Some have dug into unyielding ideological camps that offer no hope of compromise. Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short-term political points, even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long-term challenge. And out of this blizzard of charges and countercharges, confusion has reigned.
  Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do.
  Now is the time to deliver on healthcare.
  The plan I’m announcing tonight would meet three basic goals: It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don’t. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government.
  It’s a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge – not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it’s a plan that incorporates ideas from senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans – and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.
  Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan: First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.
  What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most.
  They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick.
  And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies – because there’s no reason we shouldn’t be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse.
  That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives. That’s what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan – more security and stability.
  Now, if you’re one of the tens of millions of Americans who don’t currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices.
  Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It’s how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it’s time to give every American the same opportunity that we’ve given ourselves.
  For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned.
  This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can’t get insurance today because they have preexisting medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it’s a good idea now, and we should embrace it.
  Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those – particularly the young and healthy – who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers.
  The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don’t sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people’s expensive emergency room visits.
  If some businesses don’t provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their.
  And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek – especially requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions – just can’t be achieved.
  That’s why under my plan, individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance – just as most states require you to carry auto insurance.
  Likewise, businesses will be required to either offer their workers healthcare, or chip in to help cover the cost of their workers.
  There will be a hardship waiver for those individuals who still cannot afford coverage, and 95% of all small businesses, because of their size and narrow profit margin, would be exempt from these requirements.
  But we cannot have large businesses and individuals who can afford coverage game the system by avoiding responsibility to themselves or their employees.
  Improving our healthcare system only works if everybody does their part.
  While there remain some significant details to be ironed out, I believe a broad consensus exists for the aspects of the plan I just outlined:
  And I have no doubt that these reforms would greatly benefit Americans from all walks of life, as well as the economy as a whole.
  Still, given all the misinformation that’s been spread over the past few months, I realize that many Americans have grown nervous about reform.
  So tonight I’d like to address some of the key controversies that are still out there.
  Some of people’s concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost. The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens.
  Such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.
  To my progressive friends, I would remind you that for decades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it. The public option is only a means to that end – and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal.
  And to my Republican friends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government takeover of healthcare, we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have. There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false – the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally. And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up – under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.
  My healthcare proposal has also been attacked by some who oppose reform as a “government takeover” of the entire healthcare system. As proof, critics point to a provision in our plan that allows the uninsured and small businesses to choose a publicly-sponsored insurance option, administered by the government just like Medicaid or Medicare.
  So let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down.
  And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly – by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.
  Insurance executives don’t do this because they are bad people. They do it because it’s profitable. As one former insurance executive testified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill; they are rewarded for it. All of this is in service of meeting what this former executive called 'Wall Street’s relentless profit expectations.'
  Now, I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business. They provide a legitimate service, and employ a lot of our friends and neighbors. I just want to hold them accountable. The insurance reforms that I’ve already mentioned would do just that.
  But an additional step we can take to keep insurance companies honest is by making a not-for-profit public option available in the exchange.
  Let me be clear – it would only be an option for those who don’t have insurance. No one would be forced to choose it, and it would not impact those of you who already have insurance. In fact, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates, we believe that less than 5% of Americans would sign up.
  Despite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don’t like this idea. They argue that these private companies can’t fairly compete with the government. And they’d be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option. But they won’t be. I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects.
  But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits, administrative costs and executive salaries, it could provide a good deal for consumers. It would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.
  It’s worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I’ve proposed tonight. But its impact shouldn’t be exaggerated – by the left, the right, or the media. It is only one part of my plan, and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battle.
  For example, some have suggested that that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan.
  These are all constructive ideas worth exploring. But I will not back down on the basic principle that if Americans can’t find affordable coverage, we will provide you with a choice.
  And I will make sure that no government bureaucrat or insurance company bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need.
  Finally, let me discuss an issue that is a great concern to me, to members of this chamber, and to the public – and that is how we pay for this plan.
  Here’s what you need to know. First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits – either now or in the future. Period. And to prove that I’m serious, there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don’t materialize.
  Part of the reason I faced a trillion-dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for – from the Iraq war to tax breaks for the wealthy. I will not make that same mistake with healthcare.
  Second, we’ve estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing healthcare system – a system that is currently full of waste and abuse.
  Right now, too much of the hard-earned savings and tax dollars we spend on health care doesn’t make us healthier. That’s not my judgment – it’s the judgment of medical professionals across this country. And this is also true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid.
  In fact, I want to speak directly to America’s seniors for a moment, because Medicare is another issue that’s been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.
  More than four decades ago, this nation stood up for the principle that after a lifetime of hard work, our seniors should not be left to struggle with a pile of medical bills in their later years. That is how Medicare was born. And it remains a sacred trust that must be passed down from one generation to the next. That is why not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan.
  The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, as well as unwarranted subsidies in Medicare that go to insurance companies – subsidies that do everything to pad their profits and nothing to improve your care. And we will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.
  These steps will ensure that you – America’s seniors – get the benefits you’ve been promised. They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations. And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pocket for prescription drugs. That’s what this plan will do for you.
  So don’t pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut – especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program. That will never happen on my watch. I will protect Medicare.
  Now, because Medicare is such a big part of the healthcare system, making the program more efficient can help usher in changes in the way we deliver healthcare that can reduce costs for everybody.
  We have long known that some places, like the Intermountain Healthcare in Utah or the Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, offer high-quality care at costs below average. The commission can help encourage the adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system – everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.
  Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan. Much of the rest would be paid for with revenues from the very same drug and insurance companies that stand to benefit from tens of millions of new customers.
  This reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money – an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts. And according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of healthcare for all of us in the long-run.
  Finally, many in this chamber have long insisted that reforming our medical malpractice laws can help bring down the cost of healthcare. I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.
  So I am proposing that we move forward on a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine.
  I know that the Bush administration considered authorizing demonstration projects in individual states to test these issues. It’s a good idea, and I am directing my Secretary of Health and Human Services to move forward on this initiative today.
  Add it all up, and the plan I’m proposing will cost around $900 billion over ten years – less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.
  Most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent – but spent badly – in the existing healthcare system. The plan will not add to our deficit. The middle-class will realize greater security, not higher taxes. And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of 1.0% each year, it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.
  This is the plan I’m proposing. It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight – Democrats and Republicans. And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead. If you come to me with a serious set of proposals, I will be there to listen. My door is always open.
  But know this: I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation that it’s better politics to kill this plan than improve it.
  I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are.
  If you misrepresent what’s in the plan, we will call you out. And I will not accept the status quo as a solution. Not this time. Not now.
  Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing.
  Our deficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will close. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most. And more will die as a result. We know these things to be true.
  That is why we cannot fail. Because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed – the ones who suffer silently, and the ones who shared their stories with us at town hall meetings, in emails, and in letters.
  I received one of those letters a few days ago. It was from our beloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. He had written it back in May, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal. He asked that it be delivered upon his death.
  In it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks to the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, and his children, who are here tonight .
  And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that healthcare reform – “that great unfinished business of our society,” he called it – would finally pass.
  He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity, but he also reminded me that “it concerns more than material things.” “What we face,” he wrote, “is above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.”
  I’ve thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days – the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry debate.
  For some of Ted Kennedy’s critics, his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty. In their mind, his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government.
  But those of us who knew Teddy and worked with him here – people of both parties – know that what drove him was something more. His friend, Orrin Hatch, knows that. They worked together to provide children with health insurance. His friend John McCain knows that. hey worked together on a Patient’s Bill of Rights. His friend Chuck Grassley knows that. They worked together to provide healthcare to children with disabilities.
  On issues like these, Ted Kennedy’s passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick; and he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance; what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent – there is something that could make you better, but I just can’t afford it.
  That large-heartedness – that concern and regard for the plight of others – is not a partisan feeling. It is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character. Our ability to stand in other people’s shoes. A recognition that we are all in this together; that when fortune turns against one of us, others are there to lend a helping hand.
  A belief that in this country, hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play; and an acknowledgement that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise. This has always been the history of our progress.
  In 1933, when over half of our seniors could not support themselves and millions had seen their savings wiped away, there were those who argued that Social Security would lead to socialism. But the men and women of Congress stood fast, and we are all the better for it.
  In 1965, when some argued that Medicare represented a government takeover of healthcare, members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, did not back down. They joined together so that all of us could enter our golden years with some basic peace of mind. You see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem. They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom.
  But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, and the vulnerable can be exploited.
  What was true then remains true today. I understand how difficult this healthcare debate has been. I know that many in this country are deeply skeptical that government is looking out for them.
  I understand that the politically safe move would be to kick the can further down the road – to defer reform one more year, or one more election, or one more term. But that’s not what the moment calls for. That’s not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it’s hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress.
  I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history’s test. Because that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our character. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of America.

"Nancy Pelosi's Big Fat Jet","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/nancypelosi/a/pelosi_jet.htm","Nancy Pelosi's 'Big Fat Jet'","2009-02-19 20:05:26","  By David Emery
  Description: Email rumor Circulating since: Nov. 2008 Status: False
  Summary: Viral message claims Rep. Nancy Pelosi used a gas-guzzling, 200-seat jet to commute nonstop between Washington, D.C. and California three days a week when she was Speaker of the House at an annual cost to taxpayers of $5,760,000.
  Example: Text of forwarded email dated December 1, 2008:
  continue reading below our video
  What Do Movie Ratings Mean?
  Analysis: The nugget of truth buried in these allegations is that when Rep. Nancy Pelosi took office as Speaker of the House in 2007, House sergeant-at-arms Bill Livingood submitted a request to the Defense Dept. on her behalf for a military transport plane with the fuel capacity to fly nonstop from Washington, D.C. to Pelosi's home district in California under all weather conditions.
  The reason cited for the request was security. No one specifically asked for a larger plane, according to the available evidence, much less 'ordered a big, fat 200-seat jet.' Nor, in point of fact, did Pelosi use such a plane at an alleged annual cost to taxpayers of '$5,760,000.' Documents obtained by the government watchdog group Judicial Watch reveal that between January 2007 and November 2008 Pelosi never used a military plane larger than a 12-passenger Air Force C-37 for any domestic flight. The claim that she demanded a 200-seat aircraft apparently arose from the mistaken assumption on the part of Pelosi's political opponents that only an Air Force C-40 (equivalent to a Boeing 737 jetliner) could consistently make the coast-to-coast trip without refueling. According to an Air Force spokesman, Pelosi only used a military jet larger than the one provided to her predecessor, Dennis Hastert, on one occasion — when no smaller aircraft was available. Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said she routinely used commercial airlines for travel when not on official business.

"Nancy Pelosi: Miss Lube Rack 1955 (or 1959)?","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/nancypelosi/ss/Nancy-Pelosi-Miss-Lube-Rack.htm","Was Nancy Pelosi Miss Lube Rack of 1955?","2013-05-03 18:14:07","  Description: Viral image Circulating since: April 2013 (under this pretense) Status: False (details below)
  Text example: As shared on Facebook, May 2, 2013:
  Before They Were Famous - Nancy D'Alesandro (Pelosi) - MISS LUBE RACK 1955 -
  Now that has to be embarrassing! This would be like her being Miss QUICKIE LUBE now!
  Oh... this is disturbing on so many levels, she wasn't even attractive 'in the day.'
  Analysis: Nice try.
  I don't know who the swimsuit model in the above photo really is, but I can name at least one person it definitely isn't: Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi , the current (as of this writing) minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.
  How do I know? It only took a few minutes of online research to discover that the image originated as part of a photo spread for LIFE magazine shot by Hollywood photographer Allan Grant in 1951, not 1955.
  Born on March 26, 1940, Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro was 11 years old in 1951.
  (Note: Another version of the caption reads 'Miss Lube Rack 1959.' It's still false. Even though Pelosi would have been 19 years old in 1959, as stated above it has been documented that the photo was taken eight years before that, in 1951.)
  In any case, unlike former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin , who was a beauty pageant contestant before she got into politics, there's nothing in Pelosi's resume or biographical materials to indicate she has ever served as a model of any kind, much less a swimsuit model.
  To all appearances, her entire life has been devoted to family and politics, presumably with little time or energy left for anything else.
  The daughter of New Deal Democratic politician Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., Pelosi graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science from Trinity College in Washington, DC in 1962. She married businessman Paul Pelosi shortly thereafter and the couple moved to New York, where they had five children, and eventually moved to the West Coast, where they settled in San Francisco. It was there that Pelosi began her political career as a volunteer Democratic organizer.
  Pelosi won her first election to the House of Representatives in a 1987 special election after the incumbent had died, and retained the seat in the regular election the following year. In 2002 she was elected minority whip by her peers, then, in 2006, after Democrats became the majority party, was elected Speaker of the House. She held that position until 2010, when Republicans retook the House majority and Pelosi returned to the role of minority leader, in which she remains today.

  Circulating virally, purported statements by Democrat Nancy Pelosi condemning stock market profit-taking and advocating redistribution of wealth via a 100% windfall tax on retirement income.

  Example #2: Email contributed by R. Foley, Nov. 5, 2006:
  Published: October 22, 2006
  Nancy Pelosi condemed the new record highs of the stock market as 'just another example of Bush policies helping the rich get richer'.
  'First Bush cut taxes for the rich and the economy has rebounded with new record low unemployment rates, which only means wealthy employers are getting even wealthier at the expense of the underpaid working class'.
  She went on to say 'Despite the billions of dollars being spent in Iraq our economy is still strong and government tax revenues are at all time highs. What this really means is that business is exploiting the war effort and working Americans just to put money in their own pockets'.
  When questioned about recent stock market highs she r esponded 'Only the rich benefit from these record highs. Working Americans, welfare recipients, the unemployed and minorities are not sharing in these obscene record highs'.
  'There is no question these windfall profits and income created by the Bush administration need to be taxed at 100% rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class'.
  'Profits from the stock market do not reward the hard work of our working class who, buy their hard work, are responsible for generating these corporate profits that create stock market profits for the rich. We in congress will need to address this issue to either tax these profits or to control the stock market to prevent this unearned income to flow to the rich'.
  When asked about the fact that over 80% of all Americans have investments in mutual funds, retirement funds, 401K's, and the stock market she replied 'That may be true, but probably only 5 % account for 90% of all these investment dollars. That's just more 'trickle down' economics claiming that if a corporation is successful that everyone from the CEO to the floor sweeper benefit from higher wages and job securuty which is ridiculous'. How much of this 'trickle down' ever get to the unemployed and minorites in our county? None, and that's the tragedy of these stock market highs.'
  'We democrats are going to address this issue after the election when we take control of the congress. We will return to the 60% to 80% tax rates on the rich and we will be able to take at least 30% of all currrent lower Federal Income Tax taxpayers off the roles and increase government income substantially. We need to work toward the goal of equalizing income in our country and at the same time limiting the amount the rich can invest.'
  When asked how new these new tax dollars would be spent, she replied 'We need to raise the standard of living of our poor, unemployed and minorities. For example, we have an estimated 12 million illegal immigrents in our country who need our help along with millions of unemployed minorities. Stock market windfall profits taxes could go a long ways to guarantee these people the standard of living they would like to have as Americans'
  A Bush spoksman responded to this interview by saying 'Mrs. Pelosi has set a new standard for the spin business'.
  Analysis: Astute readers will recognize the above as a caricature of Nancy Pelosi's left-of-center views, and a poorly spelled one at that. None of the statements here attributed to Pelosi -- some of which are so nonsensical they stretch credulity even for a politician -- are to be found in the public record.
  The earliest version of the spoof I've found, dated Oct. 22, 2006 (just before the national election which resulted in Pelosi being named Speaker of the House), credits New York Times reporters Walt Bogdanich and Gretchen Morgenson for this supposed 'interview.' No such article was written by them, however, nor published in the Times .

  The modern nation of Iraq is built upon foundations that go back to some of humanity's earliest complex cultures. It was in Iraq, also known as Mesopotamia , that Babylonian king Hammurabi regularized the law in the Code of Hammurabi, c. 1772 BCE.
  Under Hammurabi's system, society would inflict upon a criminal the same harm that the criminal had inflicted upon his victim. This is codified in the famous dictum, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' More recent Iraqi history, however, tends to support the Mahatma Gandhi's take on this rule. He is supposed to have said that 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'
  Capital: Baghdad, population 9,500,000 (2008 estimate)
  Major cities: Mosul, 3,000,000
  Basra, 2,300,000
  Arbil, 1,294,000
  Kirkuk, 1,200,000
  The Republic of Iraq is a parliamentary democracy. The head of state is the president, currently Jalal Talabani, while the head of government is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki .

  Overview of the Iraq War
  The unicameral parliament is called the Council of Representatives; its 325 members serve four-year terms. Eight of those seats are specifically reserved for ethnic or religious minorities.
  Iraq's judiciary system consists of the Higher Judicial Council, the Federal Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Cassation, and lower courts. ('Cassation' literally means 'to quash' - it is another term for appeals, evidently taken from the French legal system.)
  Iraq has a total population of about 30.4 million. The population growth rate is an estimated 2.4%. About 66% of Iraqis live in urban areas.
  Some 75-80% of Iraqis are Arabs. Another 15-20% are Kurds , by far the largest ethnic minority; they live primarily in northern Iraq. The remaining roughly 5% of the population is made up of Turkomen, Assyrians, Armenians, Chaldeans and other ethnic groups.
  Both Arabic and Kurdish are official languages of Iraq. Kurdish is an Indo-European language related to Iranian languages.
  Minority languages in Iraq include Turkoman, which is a Turkic language; Assyrian, a Neo-Aramaic language of the Semitic language family; and Armenian, an Indo-European language with possible Greek roots. Thus, although the total number of languages spoken in Iraq is not high, the linguistic variety is great.
  Iraq is an overwhelmingly Muslim country, with an estimated 97% of the population following Islam . Perhaps unfortunately, it is also among the most even divided countries on Earth in terms of Sunni and Shi'a populations; 60 to 65% of Iraqis are Shi'a, while 32 to 37% are Sunni.
  Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni minority controlled the government, often persecuting Shi'as. Since the new constitution was implemented in 2005, Iraq is supposed to be a democratic country, but the Shi'a/Sunni split is a source of much tension as the nation sorts out a new form of government.
  Iraq also has a small Christian community, around 3% of the population. During the nearly decade-long war following the US-led invasion in 2003, many Christians fled Iraq for Lebanon , Syria, Jordan, or western countries.
  Iraq is a desert country, but it is watered by two major rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates. Only 12% of Iraq's land is arable. It controls a 58 km (36 mile) coast on the Persian Gulf, where the two rivers empty into the Indian Ocean.
  Iraq is bordered by Iran to the east, Turkey and Syria to the north, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the west, and Kuwait to the southeast. Its highest point is Cheekah Dar, a mountain in the north of the country, at 3,611 m (11,847 feet). Its lowest point is sea level.
  As a subtropical desert, Iraq experiences extreme seasonal variation in temperature. In parts of the country, July and August temperatures average over 48°C (118°F). During the rainy winter months of December through March, however, temperatures drop below freezing not infrequently. Some years, heavy mountain snow in the north produces dangerous flooding on the rivers.
  The lowest temperature recorded in Iraq was -14°C (7°F). The highest temperature was 54°C (129°F).
  Another key feature of Iraq's climate is the sharqi , a southerly wind that blows from April through early June, and again in October and November. It gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), causing sand storms that can be seen from space.
  The economy of Iraq is all about oil; 'black gold' provides more than 90% of government revenue, and accounts for 80% of the country's foreign exchange income. As of 2011, Iraq was producing 1.9 million barrels per day of oil, while consuming 700,000 barrels per day domestically. (Even as it exports almost 2 million barrels per day, Iraq also imports 230,000 barrels per day.)
  Since the start of the US-led War in Iraq in 2003, foreign aid has become a major component of Iraq's economy, as well. The US has pumped some $58 billion dollars worth of aid into the country between 2003 and 2011; other nations have pledge an additional $33 billion in reconstruction aid.
  Iraq's workforce is employed primarily in the service sector, although about 15 to 22% work in agriculture. The unemployment rate is around 15%, and an estimated 25% of Iraqis live below the poverty line.
  The Iraqi currency is the dinar . As of February 2012, $1 US is equal to 1,163 dinar.
  Part of the Fertile Crescent, Iraq was one of the early sites of complex human civilization and agricultural practice. Once called Mesopotamia , Iraq was the seat of the Sumerian and Babylonian cultures c. 4,000 - 500 BCE. During this early period, Mesopotamians invented or refined technologies such as writing and irrigation; the famous King Hammurabi (r. 1792- 1750 BCE) recorded the law in the Code of Hammurabi, and over a thousand of years later, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605 - 562 BCE) built the incredible Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
  After about 500 BCE, Iraq was ruled by a succession of Persian dynasties, such as the Achaemenids , the Parthians , the Sassanids and the Seleucids . Although local governments existed in Iraq, they were under Iranian control until the 600s CE.
  In 633, the year after the Prophet Muhammad died, a Muslim army under Khalid ibn Walid invaded Iraq. By 651, the soldiers of Islam had brought down the Sassanid Empire in Persia, and began to Islamicize the region that is now Iraq and Iran .
  Between 661 and 750, Iraq was a dominion of the Umayyad Caliphate , which ruled from Damascus (now in Syria ). The Abbasid Caliphate , which ruled the Middle East and North Africa from 750 to 1258, decided to build a new capital closer to the political power hub of Persia. It built the city of Baghdad, which became a center of Islamic art and learning.
  In 1258, catastrophe struck the Abbasids and Iraq in the form the Mongols under Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan . The Mongols demanded that Baghdad surrender, but the Caliph Al-Mustasim refused. Hulagu's troops laid siege to Baghdad, taking the city with at least 200,000 Iraqi dead. The Mongols also burned the Grand Library of Baghdad and its wonderful collection of documents - one of the great crimes of history. The caliph himself was executed by being rolled in a carpet and trampled by horses; this was an honorable death in Mongol culture, because none of the caliph's noble blood touched the ground.
  Hulagu's army would meet defeat by the Egyptian Mamluk slave-army in the Battle of Ayn Jalut . In the Mongols' wake, however, the Black Death carried away about a third of Iraq's population. In 1401, Timur the Lame (Tamerlane) captured Baghdad, and ordered another massacre of its people.
  Timur's fierce army only controlled Iraq for a few years, and was supplanted by the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Empire would rule Iraq from the fifteenth century through 1917, when Britain wrested the Middle East from Turkish control and the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
  Under the British/French plan to divide the Middle East, the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, Iraq became part of the British Mandate. On November 11, 1920, the region became a British mandate under the League of Nations, called the 'State of Iraq.' Britain brought in a (Sunni) Hashemite king from the region of Mecca and Medina, now in Saudi Arabia, to rule over the primarily Shi'a Iraqis and Kurds of Iraq, sparking widespread discontent and rebellion.
  In 1932, Iraq gained nominal independence from Britain, although the British-appointed King Faisal still ruled the country and the British military had special rights in Iraq. The Hashemites ruled until 1958, when King Faisal II was assassinated in a coup led by Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim. This signaled the beginning of a rule by a series of strongmen over Iraq, which lasted through 2003.
  Qasim's rule survived for just five years, before being overthrown in turn by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in February of 1963. Three years later, Arif's brother took power after the colonel died; however, he would rule Iraq for just two years before being deposed by a Ba'ath Party-led coup in 1968. The Ba'athist government was led by Ahmed Hasan Al-Bakir at first, but he was slowly elbowed aside over the next decade by Saddam Hussein .
  Saddam Hussein formally seized power as president of Iraq in 1979. The following year, feeling threatened by rhetoric from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , new leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran that led to the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War .
  Hussein himself was a secularist, but the Ba'ath Party was dominated by Sunnis. Khomeini hoped that Iraq's Shi'ite majority would rise up against Hussein in an Iranian Revolution -style movement, but that did not happen. With support from the Gulf Arab states and the United States, Saddam Hussein was able to fight the Iranians to a stalemate. He also took the opportunity to use chemical weapons against tens of thousands of Kurdish and Marsh Arab civilians within his own country, as well as against the Iranian troops, in blatant violation of international treaty norms and standards.
  Its economy ravaged by the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq decided to invade the small but wealthy neighboring nation of Kuwait in 1990. Saddam Hussein announced that he had annexed Kuwait; when he refused to withdraw, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to take military action in 1991 in order to oust the Iraqis. An international coalition led by the United States (which had been allied with Iraq just three years earlier) routed the Iraqi Army in a matter of months, but Saddam Hussein's troops set fire to Kuwaiti oil wells on their way out, causing an ecological disaster along the Persian Gulf coast. This fighting would come to be known as the First Gulf War .
  Following the First Gulf War, the United States patrolled a no-fly zone over the Kurdish north of Iraq to protect civilians there from Saddam Hussein's government; Iraqi Kurdistan began to function as a separate country, even while nominally still part of Iraq. Throughout the 1990s, the international community was concerned that Saddam Hussein's government was trying to develop nuclear weapons. In 1993, the US also learned that Hussein had made a plan to assassinate President George H. W. Bush during the First Gulf War. The Iraqis allowed UN weapons inspectors in to the country, but expelled them in 1998, claiming that they were CIA spies. In October of that year, US President Bill Clinton called for 'regime change' in Iraq.
  After George W. Bush became president of the United States in 2000, his administration began to prepare for a war against Iraq. Bush the younger resented Saddam Hussein's plans to kill Bush the elder, and made the case that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons despite rather flimsy evidence. The September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC gave Bush the political cover he needed to launch a Second Gulf War, even though Saddam Hussein's government had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks.
  The Iraq War began on March 20, 2003, when a US-led coalition invaded Iraq from Kuwait. The coalition drove the Ba'athist regime out of power, installing an Iraqi Interim Government in June of 2004, and organizing free elections for October of 2005. Saddam Hussein went in to hiding, but was captured by US troops on December 13, 2003. In the chaos, sectarian violence broke out across the country between the Shi'a majority and the Sunni minority; al-Qaeda seized the opportunity to establish a presence in Iraq.
  Iraq's interim government tried Saddam Hussein for the killing of Iraqi Shi'ites in 1982, and sentenced him to death. Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006. After a 'surge' of troops to quell violence in 2007-2008, the US withdrew from Baghdad in June of 2009, and left Iraq completely in December of 2011.

  Albeit heavy-handed and overwrought to the point of incoherence, the piece is an attempt to ridicule pundits who have criticized Israel for what they call 'disproportionate use of force' during its recent military conflict with Hezbollah. The implication is that they would have done the same in response to the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising by Polish Jews against Nazi oppression during World War II.
  Given any thought, however, the headlines themselves betray the authors' satirical intent: 'European Leaders Blame Jews for Disproportionate Response,' 'Jewish Resistance Shatters Hopes for Peaceful Final Solution,' and 'Peace Vigil Calls for a Cease-Fire.' It's an understatement to say they don't reflect the reality of the time.
  For good measure, I scanned the New York Times archives and found several articles reporting the horrific conditions in the Warsaw Ghetto, events leading up to the uprising, and the uprising itself, none of which evinced even a hint of criticism aimed at Jews who took up arms against the Nazis in 1943.

  For all the talk of the nation having entered a 'post-racial' phase as of the landmark 2008 election, it's crystal clear that racial antagonisms still exist, and won't go away overnight.
  Around the same time the above image began circulating (late February 2009), another example of blatant prejudice surfaced in the form of an Obama-themed book display in a Florida Barnes & Noble store containing a volume entitled Monkeys (for which the company apologized, saying it was a case of customer vandalism).
  It is not the case, needless to say, that either of the two customized Boeing 747 aircraft officially designated Air Force One when used by the President bears the tail number 'NI66ER' (call letters N-I-SIX-SIX-E-R). The actual tail numbers are 28000 and 29000.

  President Barack Obama's last day as president will be January 20, 2017, which is a Friday. Obama's last full day in the White House will be on Jan. 19, 2017, which is a Thursday.
  Obama, like every other president serving his final term, became a lame duck president the day he was sworn into office for a second time following his Election Day rout of Mitt Romney in 2012 .
  The next president will be chosen in the 2016 election and be sworn into office at noon on Jan. 20, 2017. That day is called Inauguration Day .
  The date of the presidential swearing-in and conclusion of a president's term is set by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution .
  Related Story : 5 Things the President Does on His Last Day in Office
  Under the terms of the 20th Amendment, Obama's second term ends at noon on Jan. 20, 2017. The first term of Obama's successor begins upon the swearing-in ceremony at that time.
  The 20th Amendment reads, in part:
  'The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.'
  It's become a sort of modern-day political tradition for a president's staunchest critics to begin counting down his last days in office. Obama endured such treatment from conservative Republicans.
  There were even commercial endeavors to celebrate Obama's last day in office: bumper stickers, buttons and T-shirts announcing Jan. 20, 2017, as the 'End of an error' and 'American's happiest day.'
  Obama's predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, was the target of similar campaigns, including an Out of Office Countdown Wall Calendar that included some of the most well known Bushisms .
  Related Story: Was Barack Obama More Popular Than George W. Bush?
  The Republican National Committee celebrated Obama's last day as president by posting the date on its website even before he was elected to a second term in 2012. The GOP designed the ad to raise money from conservatives worried about him being re-elected.
  The party said:
  'The RNC is clearly not giving President Obama a free pass in 2012 - quite the opposite actually, we are aggressively showing voters what our country would look like after another four years of President Obama and his tax and spend policies that have done nothing to create jobs and leave us vulnerable to governments like China.'
  Obama was sworn into a second term on Jan. 20, 2013, after easily defeating Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.
  Obama, like all U.S. presidents, cannot serve a third term in the White House because of the Constitution's 22nd Amendment , even though many conspiracy theorists believe Obama will try to remain president beyond his eight years in office.

"Obama's Decision Making in Somali Pirate Hostage Crisis","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/obama_pirates.htm","Email Questions Obama's Decision Making in Pirate Hostage Crisis","2009-04-21 17:30:43","  Forwarded email criticizes Barack Obama's handling of the Somali pirate hostage crisis in April 2009, alleging that the President hindered the on-scene commander's ability to effect a rescue by withholding authorization to use deadly force.
  Description: Forwarded email Circulating since: April 2009 Status: Mostly false
  Email example contributed by Elsie T., Apr. 19, 2009:
  Comments: This text purports to offer an account of the 'real' decision-making process behind the Naval rescue of cargo ship captain Richard Phillips from a band of pirates during a five-day armed standoff off the coast of Somalia. It differs from the official version in alleging that President Obama, who has been widely hailed for his behind-the-scenes management of the crisis, effectively tied the hands of the on-scene Naval commander and prolonged the ordeal by withholding authorization to use deadly force.
  Retired admiral disavows message However, while the text claims inside information about the actual sequence of events came from military sources directly involved in the operation (specifically Navy SEALs), no such sources are identified by name, nor is any means of authenticating the divergent account of the incident provided. Some versions of the message attibute its content to Ret. Rear Admiral Lou Sarosdy, who, although he publicly acknowledges receiving, reading, and forwarding the email, firmly denies having authored it . 'I don't know any SEALs,' Sarosdy said in a statement to the Virginian-Pilot . 'I have no idea who transmitted that.' He further stated that he doesn't know if any of it is true.
  Text was partly excerpted from partisan blog The latter half of the message appears to have been clumsily copied from a posting by conservative blogger Jeff Emanuel, who argues that the Obama administration unduly claimed credit for a mission whose success was actually hampered by the indecisiveness and lack of experience of the commander-in-chief.
  Once again, however, while Emanuel is entitled to his opinion, it appears at least in part to be based on unsourced intelligence which differs substantively from heretofore published accounts.
  For example, Emanuel asserts the following in the quoted excerpt: 'With the Bainbridge in range and a rescue by his country's Navy possible, Phillips threw himself off of his lifeboat prison, enabling Navy shooters onboard the destroyer a clear shot at his captors — and none was taken. The guidance from National Command Authority — the President of the United States, Barack Obama — had been clear: a peaceful solution was the only acceptable outcome to this standoff unless the hostage’s life was in clear, extreme danger.' According to an account published in the Los Angeles Times , however, the operative factor was the timing of Phillips' escape.
  '[T]he Navy had no warning that Phillips was going to attempt to flee,' the article states. 'Although a military special operations team had been mobilized, it had not yet arrived, and the Navy had no way to capitalize on Phillips' gumption ' (emphasis added). Lethal force was authorized Emanuel further asserts that when the hostage takers fired on a U.S. vessel as it approached their lifeboat early the next day (Saturday), Navy marksmen failed to return fire 'thanks to the combination of a lack of clear guidance from Washington and a mandate from the commander-in-chief’s staff not to act until Obama, a man with no background of dealing with such issues and no track record of decisiveness, decided that any outcome other than a 'peaceful solution' would be acceptable.' In point of fact, however, Obama had authorized the use of lethal force as of the night before, according to more than one published account.
  Every mainstream source agrees that by the time Navy SEAL sharpshooters did arrive on the scene full authorization had been granted. So, contrary to what Emanuel and the anonymous email in which he is quoted imply — namely that when the on-scene commander finally ordered Navy sharpshooters to bring down the hostage takers he had to do so on his own recognizance due to Obama's reluctance — the fact is, he had already been authorized to do so. None of which is to take sides on the question of whether the President acquitted himself admirably in his handling of the hostage crisis or not, or whether the standoff might have been ended more quickly under different leadership, or who ultimately deserves credit for the operation's success.
  Opinions are bound to differ. At issue is whether and to what extent the substantive statements in the email comport with the known facts. There are discrepancies worth noting. Update: In an April 22, 2009 article in the Washington Times , National Security Adviser James. L. Jones and other military officials confirmed the accuracy of mainstream press accounts of the hostage crisis and dismissed online allegations to the contrary as false.

  Forwarded email claims President Obama signed an executive order lending $2 billion of taxpayer money to a Brazilian oil company for offshore drilling to produce oil for China.
  Description: Email rumor Circulating since: Aug. 2009 Status: Mostly false
  Example: Email text contributed by Keith H., Sep. 8, 2009:
  This is a perfect example why I refrain from watching the news on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN or NSNBC. Today (20 August 2009) on a segment of the 'Glen Beck Show' on FCN (Fox Cable News) was the following:
  'Today even though President Obama is against off shore drilling for oil for this country. He signed an executive order to loan 2 Billion of our taxpayers dollars to a Brazilian Oil Exploration Company (which is the 8th largest company in the entire world) to drill for oil off the coast of Brazil. The oil that comes from this operation is for the sole purpose and use of China and not the USA. The Chinese government is under contract to purchase all the oil that this oil field will produce, which is hundreds of millions of barrels of oil'. We have absolutely no gain from this transaction whatsoever.
  Wait it gets more interesting. Guess who is the largest individual stockholder of this Brazilian Oil Company and who would benefit most from this? It is American Billionaire, George Soros, Liberal businessman who is a radical left wing supporter, finances MoveOn.org as well as other liberal programs and was President Obama's largest and most generous supporter during his campaign. If you are able to connect the dots and follow the money, you are probably as upset as I am. Not a word of this transaction was on any of the other news networks.

  Top 5 Grossing Movies of All Time
  Analysis: Unfounded rumors. President Obama signed no such executive order.
  In April 2009, the U.S. Export-Import Bank , whose stated mission is 'to assist in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to international markets,' approved a preliminary commitment to lend at least $2 billion to Petrobras, Brazil's national oil company, to fund the purchase of equipment and services from American companies. The commitment was approved by the Export-Import Bank's bipartisan Board of Directors before any Obama appointees joined the agency.
  As the Export-Import Bank is self-sustaining, no taxpayer moneys are involved.
  While it's true that Petrobras has committed to supplying China with up to 200,000 barrels of oil a day for the next 10 years (thanks to a $10 billion loan from that country's Development Bank), it's not true that all of the oil produced under the U.S. agreement is earmarked for China.
  Billionaire George Soros' hedge fund, Soros Fund Management LLC, owns millions of shares in Petrobras, though according to Bloomberg.com he cut his stake considerably during the second quarter of 2009. Soros was a major supporter of Obama's presidential bid and contributed to his 2008 campaign.
  As to the claim that the U.S. has 'absolutely no gain from this transaction whatsoever,' Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred P. Hochberg begs to differ, stating that Bank's mandate is to 'help create and sustain U.S. jobs by financing U.S. exports. Our offer to provide financing to Brazil's state-owned oil company Petrobras does exactly that.'

I asked him what an 'Obama phone' was and he went on to say that welfare recipients are now eligible to receive (1) a FREE new phone and (2) approx 70 minutes of FREE minutes every month. I was a little skeptical so I Googled it and low and behold he was telling the truth. TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES.

  Analysis:
  Q: Is there a U.S. government program that provides free or discounted phones and wireless service to low-income Americans? A: Yes. It consists of two parts: 'Link-Up,' which helps income-eligible people set up new home phone service, and 'Lifeline,' which helps income-eligible people pay their monthly phone charges. (Source: FCC)
  Q: Was this program instituted by the Obama administration? A: No. Nor was it just instituted 'earlier this year,' as the email claims. The program as it exists today was created over a decade ago by an act of Congress, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. A version of the Lifeline program was already in operation as far back as the early 1980s. (Source: USAC.org)
  Q: Does the program offer every welfare recipient a free phone and 70 minutes of wireless service? A: Not necessarily. The specific benefits vary according to locale and service provider. Also, the program is designed to help low-income people generally, not just welfare recipients. Examples: Safelink Wireless | ATT Lifeline and Link-Up | Verizon Low Income Programs . (Source: FCC)
  Q: Is it accurate to say that taxpayer money is being 'redistributed' to provide these services? A: Basically yes, though not in the sense one might assume. Apart from being administered by the FCC, it's not a federally-funded program. Since its inception, the program has been financed via the pooled contributions of commercial phone service providers, which in turn impose small monthly fees on their regular customers to recoup the cost.

Bogus ' speeding ticket frenzy ' warnings are an online staple, first erupting in New Jersey in 2005 and cropping up regularly ever since. Prior to the appearance of this version, the last such warning targeting Michigan drivers made the rounds in January 2008. Although Michigan has no such program, the name 'Operation Yellow Jacket' has been applied by other states to public safety projects involving the collaboration of State Police and Departments of Transportation. In Pennsylvania, state troopers actually do masquerade as transportation workers to catch speeding drivers in construction zones. A similar program in North Carolina involves Highway Patrol cruisers hiding behind DOT trucks with radar guns at the ready.

  On April 28, 2004 -- a year into the American invasion and occupation of Iraq-- CBS' 60 Minutes program broadcast photographs showing American soldiers apparently abusing, humiliating, beating and torturing Iraqi prisoners held at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad.
  Low-ranking members of the Army's 372nd Military Police Company took the fall for the abuse, but declassified Bush administration memos since documented the common use of torture methods on prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.
  Fewer than 300 Abu Ghraib photographs were made public in 2004. President Obama promised to disclose all photographs--then reversed himself, lending the torture scandal a new dimension: a cover-up disguised as protection of American servicemen.
  The following photographs are from the original, 2004 disclosures. Military intelligence forces told members of the Red Cross that between 70 percent and 90 percent of the inmates pictured here were arrested by mistake.
  In civilian life, Ivan Frederick, also known as 'Chip,' pictured here in an implicitly taunting situation with an inmate at Abu Ghraib prison, was a $26,722-a-year prison guard at Buckingham Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in central Virginia, where his wife, Martha, worked in the prison's training department. The prison incarcerates about 1,000 inmates.
  Frederick was sentenced to eight years in prison for his role in prisoner abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib, where he was the senior enlisted man in fall, 2003.
  Former Army Staff Sgt. Ivan Frederick, known as Chip Frederick, was a reservist from Virginia who had been a prison guard at Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Virginia. He was the senior enlisted soldier at Abu Ghraib prison in the fall of 2003. It was Frederick who attached wires to a hooded detainee and threatened him with electrocution if he fell off a box--the photograph became the iconic representation of the Abu Ghraib scandal--who forced prisoners to masturbate and simulate oral sex, and who sat on top of a prisoner sandwiched in between two medical litters while posing for a photograph, among other abuses.
  Frederick was court-martialed in Baghdad. He pled guilty to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault, and indecent acts. He was originally sentenced to 10 years, reduced to eight as part of a pre-trial agreement, with loss of pay and dishonorable discharge.

  Hussein Mohssein Mata Al Zayidai, Abu Ghraib Detainee #19446, 1242/18, gave the following sworn testimony:
  “I was in the solitary confinement, me and my friends. We were treated badly. They took our clothes off, even the underwear and they beat us very hard, and they put a hood over my head. And when I told them I am sick they laughed at me and beat me. And one of them brought my friend and told him “stand here” and they brought me and had me kneel in front of my friend.
  They told my friend to masturbate and told me to masturbate also, while they were taking pictures. After that they brought my friends, Haidar, Ahmed, Noun, Ahzem, Hashiem, Mustafa, and I, and they put us 2 on the bottom, 2 on top of them, and 2 on top of those and one on top. They took pictures of us and we were naked. After the end of the beating, they took us to our separate cells and they opened the water in the cell and told us to lay face down in the water and we stayed like that until the morning, in the water, naked, without clothes. Then one of the other shift gave us clothes, but the second shift took the clothes away at night and handcuffed us to the beds. [...]
  Q: How did you feel when the guards were treating you this way? A: I was trying to kill myself but I didn't have any way of doing it. Q: Did the guards force you to crawl on your hands and knees on the ground? A: Yes. They forced us to do this thing. Q: What were the guards doing while you were crawling on your hands and knees?
  A: They were sitting on our backs like riding animals. Q: When you were on each other, what were the guards doing? A: They were taking pictures and writing on our asses. Q: How many times did the guards treat you this way? A: The first time when I just go in, and the second day they put us in the water and handcuffed us. Q: Did you see the guards treat the other inmates this way. A: I didn't see, but I heard screams and shouts in another area.

  Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigation reports widespread use of dogs as a means of terrorizing prisoners:
  'The first documented incident of abuse with dogs occurred on 24 November 2003, just four days after the dogs teams arrived. An Iraqi detainee was smuggled a pistol by an Iraqi Police Guard. While attempting to confiscate the weapon, an MP was shot an the detainee was subsequently shot and wounded.
  Following the shooting, LTC Jordan ordered several interrogators to the Hard Site to screen eleven Iraqi Police who were detained following the shooting. The situation at the Hard Site was described by many as “chaos,” and no one real appeared to be in charge. The perception was that LTG Sanchez had removed all restrictions that night because of the situation; however, that was not true. No one is able to pin down how. that perception was created. A Navy Dog Team entered the Hard Site and was instructed to search for additional weapons and explosives. The dogs searched the cells, no explosives were detected and the Navy Dog Team eventually completed their mission and left. Shortly thereafter, [dogs] were recalled when someone “needed” a dog.'
  At one point, 'one of the men said words to the effect 'You see that dog there, if you don’t tell me what I want to know, I’m gonna get that dog on you!' [...] Even with all the apparent confusion over roles, responsibilities and authorities, there were early indications that MP and Military Intelligence personnel knew the use of dog teams in interrogations was abusive.'
  The report includes the documented case of a dog biting an inmate on Dec. 12, 2003. At the time, the inmate 'was not undergoing an interrogation and no MI personnel were present. [The prisoner] told [a guard] that a dog had bitten him and [the guard] saw dog bite marks on [the prisoner's] thigh. [...] This incident was captured on digital photograph ... and appears to be the result of MP harassment and amusement, no MI involvement is suspected.'
  Coalition forces and military intelligence told the International Committee of the Red Cross that between 70 percent and 90 percent of the inamtes in Iraqi prisons were innocent--picked up by mistake.
  One such case was Hayder Sabbar Abd, prisoner #13077, the man in the hood in the photograph above. He is being taunted and humiliated by former pfc. Lynndie England. The New York Times' Ian Fisher tracked down Abd after his release in May 2004.
  'The shame is so deep,' Fisher wrote , that 'Abd says he feels that he cannot move back to his old neighborhood. He would prefer not even to stay in Iraq. But now the entire world has seen the pictures... pointing out the key figures, starting with three American soldiers wearing big smiles for the camera.'
  'The truth is we were not terrorists,' Abd said. 'We were not insurgents. We were just ordinary people. And American intelligence knew this.'
  According to Abd, the father of five children and a Shiite Muslim from Nasiriya, he had served 18 years in the Iraqi military, at times in the Republican Guard, but was demoted to the regular army after several desertions. He was arrested in June 2003 at a military checkpoint when he tried to walk away from the taxi he was riding in. He was held for three months and four days in a prison in southern Iraq before being transferred to Abu Ghraib. He was never charged and never interrogated.
  In a sworn statement to military investigators, Abd said:
  'After they took off my clothes the American soldier removed who was wearing glasses, night guard, and I saw an American female soldier which they call her Ms.
  Maya, in front of me they told me to stroke my penis in front of her. [...] They were laughing, taking pictures, and they were stepping on our hands with their feet. And they started taking one after another and they wrote on our bodies in English. I don’t know what they wrote, but they were taking pictures after that. Then, after that they forced us to walk like dogs on our hands and knees we had to bark like a dog and if we didn’t do that, they start hitting us hard on our face and chest with no mercy. After that, they took us to our cells, took the mattresses out and dropped water on the floor and they made us sleep on our stomachs on the floor with the bags on our head and they took pictures of everything.'
  From Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigation:
  'There is also ample evidence of detainees being forced to wear women's underwear, sometimes on their heads. These cases appear to be a form of humiliation, either for [Military Police] control or for [Military Intelligence} 'ego down.''
  [...]
  'A photograph taken on 17 October 2003 depicts a naked detainee chained to his cell door with a hood on his head. Several other photographs taken on 18 October 2003 depict a hooded detainee cuffed to his cell door.
  Additional photographs on 19 October 2003 depict a detainee cuffed to his bed with underwear on his head. A review of available documents could not tie these photos to a specific incident, detainee or allegation, but these photos reinforce the reality that humiliation and nudity were being employed routinely enough that photo opportunities occurred on three successive days. [Military Intelligence] involvement in these apparent abuses cannot be confirmed.'
  The investigation notes: 'There is no record of an Interrogation Plan or any approval documents which would authorize these techniques. The fact these techniques were documented in the Interrogation Report suggests, however, that the interrogators believed they had the authority to use clothing as an incentive, as well as stress positions, and were not attempting to hide their use. [...] It is probable that use of nudity was sanctioned at some level within the chain-of-command. If not, lack of leadership and oversight permitted the nudity to occur.
  Having a detainee raise his hands to expose himself in front of two females is humiliation and therefore violates the Geneva Conventions.'
  In fact, the secret Bush administration memos released by the Obama administration in 2009 show that the Bush Justice Department had approved abuse and torture methods including denying inmates sleep for 11 days, forced nudity, spraying detainees with 41-degree water, and confining detainees in small boxes. Some of those methods were used at Abu Ghraib, others at secret 'black sites' and in Afghanistan.
  Maj. Gen. George R. Fay's investigative report states: 'A photograph taken circa 27 December 2003, depicts a naked DETAINEE-14, apparently shot with a shotgun in his buttocks. This photograph could not be tied to a specific incident, detainee or allegation and Military Intelligence involvement is indeterminate.'
  A February 2003 International Committee of the Red Cross report noted that 'Since March 2003, the IRC recorded, and in some cases witnessed, a number of incidents in which guards shot at persons deprived of their liberty with live ammunition, in the context either of unrest relating to internment conditions or of escape attempts by individuals.'
  One of the iconic photographs of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal shows an inmate, who became known in military investigation documents as 'DETAINEE-25,' covered in mud and what appears to be feces. The inmate's story is among the most tragic at Abu Ghraib. He was known by his captors to have severe mental disabilities--known to be inclined to self-abuse. His captors encouraged the acts, providing him with implements with which to abuse himself, parading him, encouraging him and photographing him.
  The inmate had no value to military intelligence. His presence at Abu Ghraib was unjustified, his treatment an abject crime.
  Mag. Gen. George Fay's report states:
  'A 18 November 2003 photograph depicts a detainee dressed in shirt or blanket lying on the floor with a banana inserted into his anus. This as well as several others show the same detainee covered in feces, with his hands encased in sandbags, or tied in foam and between two stretchers. These are all identified as DETAINEE-25 and were determined by CID investigation to be self-inflicted incidents.
  Even so, these incidents constitute abuse; a detainee with a known mental condition should not have been provided the banana or photographed. The detainee has a severe mental problem and the restraints depicted in these photographs were allegedly used to prevent the detainee from sodomizing himself and assaulting himself and others with his bodily fluids. He was known for inserting various objects into his rectum and for consuming and throwing his urine and feces. Military Intelligence had no association with this detainee.'
  The question remains: what was a detainee with such severe mental disabilities doing at Abu Ghraib prison to start with, and in a ward of the prison where none of the personnel was professionally equipped to deal with mentally disabled inmates?
  According to Maj. Gen. George Fay's investigative report into Abu Ghraib abuses, 'The use of nudity as an interrogation technique or incentive to maintain the cooperation of detainees was not a technique developed at Abu Ghraib, but rather a technique which was imported and can be traced through Afghanistan and GTMO [Guantanamo Bay]. As interrogation operations in Iraq began to take form, it was often the same personnel who had operated and deployed in other theaters and in support of GWOT, who were called upon to establish and conduct interrogation operations in Abu Ghraib.
  The lines of authority and the prior legal opinions blurred. They simply carried forward the use of nudity into the Iraqi theater of operations. The use of clothing as an incentive (nudity) is significant in that it likely contributed to an escalating 'de-humanization' of the detainees and set the stage for additional and more severe abuses to occur.'

"Petition Against Appointment of W. David Hager to FDA Panel","http://uspolitics.about.com/od/healthcare/a/Intrinsa_d03.htm","FDA Panel Rejects Intrinsa","2004-12-03 18:13:39","  Updated November 02, 2015 . The 14-member FDA advisory committee, plus voting consultants, for Reproductive Health Drugs unanimously rejected Proctor and Gamble's (P&G) fast-track request for Intrinsa, a transdermal testosterone targeted for surgically menopausal women. A P&G blinded exit interview of 132 patients from the two pivotal trials found a 52% to 31% meaningful response rate among the women treated. In a vote of 14 to three, the committee agreed that Intrinsas effect was clinically meaningful. However, the committee cited the potential for off-label use as one reason for rejecting the application. 'I think that in light of the potential for off-label use for this product, we must have information from premenopausal women and menopausal women. We must have information from women who are not only taking estrogen, but women who are taking estrogen with progesterone,' commented committee member David Hager, MD (University of Kentucky). Hager's comments reflected concerns cited in The Street. K. Noelle Tune of Leerink Swann & Co. was quoted as being concerned that 'the conservative nature' of some committee members might affect the panel vote, causing them to be reluctant to approve a so-called 'lifestyle' drug. There were a myriad of other possible risks cited, such as possible fetal impacts (the drug is for women who have no ovaries), heart disease, and breast cancer. News reports have cited the Women's Health Iniative (WHI) as a cautionary tale and have mischaracterized its results as 'increased risk of strokes for post-menopausal women who take estrogen.' The drug tested in WHI was not estrogren, it was a non-bio-identical estrogen which is created from pregnant mare's urine. There have been no such clinical trials for bio-identical estrogen, which is available via a transdermal patch like that used for Intrinsa. News reports have also quoted two men -- one consulting member and one permanent member -- but no reports have quoted the committee chair, Linda Giudice MD/PhD, Stanford University Medical Center. Whether this decision is politically-, medicially-, or CYA-based is not clear. The FDA has come under heavy criticism recently for approval of drugs which, at least in hindsight, seem highly questionable. Significance According to a P&G spokesperson, 20-25 percent of the 25 million women in the US who are surgically menopausal, the group targeted for this drug, are 'distressed by their lack of sexual desire.' Another 10 percent of the 30 million naturually post-menopausal women are also distressed. Intrinsa would be the first FDA-approved drug to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women with surgical menopause. There are many other female sexual disorder products being tested as patches, pills, gels, creams, and nasal sprays. In neighboring Canada, post-menopausal women have been able to obtain government-approved testosterone treatment for at least two years. Down-under, in Australia, post-menopausal women can use Organon testosterone implants. The downside is that are surgically inserted, and the testosterone lasts from three to six months. A convenient delivery mechanism like the transdermal patch would make this accessible to more women.

  Why Testosterone Intrinsa, which P&G licensed from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 1997, releases testosterone through the skin in an amount a women would have produced before menopause. This is a much smaller dose than transdermal patches for men, which is Watson's target. The focus in news analylsis is on 'lifestyle' - however, testosterone has many functions beyond sexual desire. These include maintenance of muscle mass and strength, maintenance of bone density and strength, and mental and physical energy.
  Australian researcher Susan Davis, director of research at the Jean Hailes Foundation in Melbourne, said 'All the talk of enhancing sexual performance and the 'Pink Viagra' tag is highly misleading . . . I dislike the term for Intrinsa because it is more of a wellbeing drug, not purely a sexual function treatment.' She also said that the 'good thing about taking testosterone' is if you develop a side effect, it stops the minute you stop wearing the patch or implant.' In the US, testosterone is available at compounding pharmacies for women whose doctors will prescribe it; usually the formulation is a cream.
  Most insurance plans will not pay for this formulation. That is one reason FDA approval is important -- it legitimizes the drug. Moreover, it sets recommended dosages. Testosterone is also available in the US - off-label use - in a non-bio-identical form that is paired with the same non-bio-identical estrogen implicated in WHI. Politics In USA Today, Laura Berman writes:
  She also points out that one of the problems in getting approval for women is that the FDA has set a 'male-defined outcome' for determining effectiveness by focusing on number of orgasms. She says that this model works for men but does not for women where 'intimacy' is a necessary part of the equation.
  She contends that research which screens women who have psychological impediments from those who have physical impediments shows that drugs like Viagra do have a positive impacton arousal and satisfaction. She closes by writing: 'Though women may be more complicated, our sexual health deserves as much attention as men's. At the very least, it merits the same debate that race is currently stirring up within the medical community.' Sources:

"Petition Against Pascua-Lama Gold Mine","http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/rightsandfreedoms/a/How-To-Petition-Government-Online.htm","How to Petition the Government in Under 5 Minutes","2011-09-02 11:16:20","  By Tom Murse
  Got a gripe?
  Congress is prohibited from restricting the right of American citizens to petition the government under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , adopted in 1791. The authors of the amendment surely had no idea just how easy it would become to petition the government in the age of the Internet more than 200 years later.
  President Barack Obama , whose White House was the first to use social media such as Twitter and Facebook , launched the first online tool allowing citizens to petition the government through an official website in 2011. The program, called We the People, allows users to create and sign petitions on any topic.
  'When I ran for this office, I pledged to make government more open and accountable to its citizens,' Obama said in announcing the program in September 2011. 'That's what the new We the People feature on WhiteHouse.gov is all about - giving Americans a direct line to the White House on the issues and concerns that matter most to them.'
  The Obama White House often portrayed itself as one of the most transparent to the public in modern history. Obama's first executive order , for example, directed the Obama White House to shed more light on presidential records. Obama has, however, come under fire for operated behind closed doors .
  The We the People tool allows Americans over the age of 13 to create and sign petitions on www.whitehouse.gov asking the Obama administration to 'take action on a range of important issues facing our country.' All that is required is a valid email address.
  'Creating or signing a petition is just the first step. It's up to you to build support for a petition and gather even more signatures. Use email , Facebook , Twitter and word of mouth to tell your friends, family and coworkers about the petitions you care about,' the White House said.
  The Obama administration promised that any petition that has 5,000 signatures attached to it will be sent to the 'appropriate policymakers.' 'If a petition meets the signature threshold, it will be reviewed by the Administration and an official response will be issued,' the administration said.
  The White House said any official response will be not only by emailed petition-signers by posted on its website as well. The We the People site was to open in late September 2011.
  The right of Americans is guaranteed under the Constitution's First Amendment, which reads: ' Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'
  The Obama administration, acknowledging the importance of the right, said: 'Throughout our nation's history, petitions have served as a way for Americans to organize around issues that matter to them, and tell their representatives in government where they stand.'
  Petitions played important roles, for example, in ending slavery and guaranteeing women the right to vote .
  Though the Obama administration was the first to allow Americans to petition the government through an official U.S. government website, other countries had already allowed such activities online.
  The United Kingdom , for example, operates a similar system called e-petitions . That country's system requires citizens to collect at least 100,000 signatures on their petition on their online petitions before they can be debated in the House of Commons .
  The major political parties in the United States also allow Internet users to submit suggestions that are directed to members of Congress. There are also many privately run website that allow Americans to sign petitions that are then forwarded to members of the House of Representatives and Senate .
  Of course, Americans can still write letters to their representatives in Congress , send them email or meet with them face-to-face .

"Petition to Deny Social Security Benefits to Illegal Immigrants","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/williamweisscommentary/a/Illegal_Immigration_Amnesty.htm","A Definition of Amnesty","2009-08-26 01:35:41","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Definition: Generally, amnesty is defined as any governmental pardon for past offenses or crimes, especially political ones. Granting amnesty goes beyond a pardon, in that it forgives the said offense completely, and typically without consequences. For purposes of conservative politics, amnesty is a political term typically associated with two major issues -- immigration and capital punishment. As it relates to immigration, amnesty is the term used for granting automatic citizenship to resident aliens, who are in the United States illegally. Amnesty for illegals is the subject of tremendous controversy, since it essentially bypasses the citizenship and assimilation process essential to all legal immigration into the United States. As it relates to the death penalty, amnesty is the term used for when a governor grants a reprieve from execution to a prisoner sentenced to death. In this case, amnesty is different from a pardon in that it doesn't exonerate the condemned from all punitive action or absolve the convicted of all wrongdoing.
  Was the 2013 ' Gang of Eight ' Bill Amnesty?
  The easy answer is: Not really. The 2013  immigration bill did not offer blanket amnesty. In fact, there were a number of requirements, penalties, and steps that needed to be taken in order to remain in the country legally, and not everyone would get to stay:
  The Gang of Eight bill is actually called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. It was a comprehensive immigration reform proposal originating in and passed by the US Senate. It was a Democrat-friendly bill that needed a lot of work and had a lot of poor elements to it. The eight members included Republicans Marco Rubio, John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Michael Bennet. The bill eventually passed by a vote of 68-32. From a conservative standpoint, the bill was not very good and though it had provisions beefing up border security, they were ultimately toothless and gave far too much power to the executive branch.
  Immigration Reform :
  If immigration reform fails once again, it needs to fail after both the Senate and House pass bills. If the House passes an enforcement-first bill that the Senate refuses to adopt, the Senate is equally responsible for reform failing. And while voters agree immigration reform needs to happen, they also agree that closing the border and preventing more illegal immigration is a top priority. If the bill ultimately fails it will be on those grounds. Democrats want little in the way of border security, increasing deportation of criminal aliens, or slowing down the legalization and citizenship process. All of these are crucial elements of any immigration reform. If they are absent, reform should fail. These provisions have broad support among voters. The proof is in the television and radio ads that members of the 'Gang of Eight' are running. In those ads, the Senate bill proponents constantly talk about strong enforcement measures because they know Americans do not want to see the current scenario play out again in a decade. Of course, those measures have been trimmed out of the bill. If immigration reform ultimately fails because conservatives stood for these core elements it will be harder for them to be badgered politically. After all, the are holding out for positions with broad public support. That said, the Republican Party has never been known to play to their advantages well with the public.
  Pronunciation: amnistee

"The President and the Seventh-Inning Stretch","http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/seventh_inning.htm","Who Invented the Seventh-Inning Stretch?","2003-10-16 17:58:08","  By David Emery
  Popular memory has been unkind to William Howard Taft, twenty-seventh President of the United States, who surely would have wished to be remembered for something nobler than his weight. At 300 pounds, he is the heaviest commander-in-chief on record. It's the rare biographical sketch that doesn't mention the giant bathtub — spacious enough to accommodate four average-sized men — specially built for him in the White House.
  Baseball history has accorded him somewhat more dignity, for it was Taft, some 100 years ago, who launched the tradition of the Presidential first pitch on opening day. The occasion was a game between the Washington Senators and the Philadelphia Athletics on April 14, 1910 at Griffith Stadium. Apparently on the spur of the moment, umpire Billy Evans handed Taft the ball after the rival managers had been introduced and asked him to throw it over home plate. The President did so with delight. Nearly every chief executive since Taft (the sole exception being Jimmy Carter ) has opened at least one baseball season during their tenure by tossing out the first ball.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  Legend has it that Taft inspired another baseball tradition on that same day, quite by accident. As the face-off between the Senators and the Athletics wore on, the rotund, six-foot-two president reportedly grew more and more uncomfortable in his small wooden chair. By the middle of the seventh inning he could bear it no longer and stood up to stretch his aching legs — whereupon everyone else in the stadium, thinking the president was about to leave, rose to show their respect. A few minutes later Taft returned to his seat, the crowd followed suit, and the 'seventh-inning stretch' was born.
  A charming tale, but folklorists have a saying: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't.
  Consider the story of Brother Jasper of Mary, F.S.C., the man credited with bringing baseball to Manhattan College in the late 1800s. Being the Prefect of Discipline as well as the coach of the team, it fell to Brother Jasper to supervise the student fans at every home game. On one very muggy day in 1882, during the seventh inning of play against the semi-pro Metropolitans, the Prefect saw his charges were becoming restless and called a time-out, instructing everyone in the bleachers to stand up and unwind. It worked so well he began calling for a seventh-inning rest period every game. The Manhattan College custom spread to the major leagues after the New York Giants were charmed by it at an exhibition game, and the rest is history.
  Or not. As it turns out, baseball historians have located a manuscript dated 1869 — 13 years before Brother Jasper's inspired time-out — documenting what can only be described as a seventh-inning stretch. It's a letter written by Harry Wright of the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first pro baseball team. In it, he makes the following observation about the fans' ballpark behavior: 'The spectators all arise between halves of the seventh inning, extend their legs and arms and sometimes walk about. In so doing they enjoy the relief afforded by relaxation from a long posture upon hard benches.'
  Truth be known, we have no idea where and when the custom of the seventh-inning stretch began. Based on the evidence that exists, it's doubtful the phenomenon originated with William Howard Taft , or even Brother Jasper. We know it's at least as old as 1869, that it cropped up in various places afterward and that it eventually became a solid tradition. No record of the phrase 'seventh-inning stretch' exists before 1920, by which time the practice was already at least 50 years old.
  Where history cannot tell the whole story, folklore arises to fill in the gaps.

"Petition to Keep English as Primary Language","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/williamweisscommentary/a/Illegal_Immigration_Amnesty.htm","A Definition of Amnesty","2009-08-26 01:35:41","  By Marcus Hawkins
  Definition: Generally, amnesty is defined as any governmental pardon for past offenses or crimes, especially political ones. Granting amnesty goes beyond a pardon, in that it forgives the said offense completely, and typically without consequences. For purposes of conservative politics, amnesty is a political term typically associated with two major issues -- immigration and capital punishment. As it relates to immigration, amnesty is the term used for granting automatic citizenship to resident aliens, who are in the United States illegally. Amnesty for illegals is the subject of tremendous controversy, since it essentially bypasses the citizenship and assimilation process essential to all legal immigration into the United States. As it relates to the death penalty, amnesty is the term used for when a governor grants a reprieve from execution to a prisoner sentenced to death. In this case, amnesty is different from a pardon in that it doesn't exonerate the condemned from all punitive action or absolve the convicted of all wrongdoing.
  Was the 2013 ' Gang of Eight ' Bill Amnesty?
  The easy answer is: Not really. The 2013  immigration bill did not offer blanket amnesty. In fact, there were a number of requirements, penalties, and steps that needed to be taken in order to remain in the country legally, and not everyone would get to stay:
  The Gang of Eight bill is actually called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. It was a comprehensive immigration reform proposal originating in and passed by the US Senate. It was a Democrat-friendly bill that needed a lot of work and had a lot of poor elements to it. The eight members included Republicans Marco Rubio, John McCain, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Michael Bennet. The bill eventually passed by a vote of 68-32. From a conservative standpoint, the bill was not very good and though it had provisions beefing up border security, they were ultimately toothless and gave far too much power to the executive branch.
  Immigration Reform :
  If immigration reform fails once again, it needs to fail after both the Senate and House pass bills. If the House passes an enforcement-first bill that the Senate refuses to adopt, the Senate is equally responsible for reform failing. And while voters agree immigration reform needs to happen, they also agree that closing the border and preventing more illegal immigration is a top priority. If the bill ultimately fails it will be on those grounds. Democrats want little in the way of border security, increasing deportation of criminal aliens, or slowing down the legalization and citizenship process. All of these are crucial elements of any immigration reform. If they are absent, reform should fail. These provisions have broad support among voters. The proof is in the television and radio ads that members of the 'Gang of Eight' are running. In those ads, the Senate bill proponents constantly talk about strong enforcement measures because they know Americans do not want to see the current scenario play out again in a decade. Of course, those measures have been trimmed out of the bill. If immigration reform ultimately fails because conservatives stood for these core elements it will be harder for them to be badgered politically. After all, the are holding out for positions with broad public support. That said, the Republican Party has never been known to play to their advantages well with the public.

However, you may well NOT know that in the month of March 1948, exactly Nine months after that historic day, Albert Arnold Gore, Jr.; Hillary Rodham; John F. Kerry; William Jefferson Clinton; Howard Dean; Nancy Pelosi; Dianne Feinstein; Charles E. Schumer; and Barbara Boxer were Born. That piece of information has now cleared up a lot of things.
  Analysis: This little ditty got its start in the late 1990s when Democrat Al Gore was Vice-President of the United States. In the earliest variants of the joke Gore was the only 'Roswell Democrat' named. Curiously enough, it was true. 'Al Gore claims not to be an alien,' noted one Internet wag in 1997, 'despite the fact that he was born 8 months and 3 weeks after the Roswell incident.' Granted, there's little in the way of objective evidence to suggest that Mr. Gore's provenance was anything other than terrestrial, but reliable sources do list his birthdate as March 31, 1948  just under nine months after news of the Roswell UFO crash hit the news. The joke enjoyed a boost in popularity during Gore's presidential campaign in 1999, particularly after a Republican pollster passed it along to Washington Times columnist John McCaslin, who wrote:
  The joke lost its relevance when Gore lost the 2000 election, but it reappeared six years later with another eight Democrats added to the roster of supposed Roswell offspring. Much as I hate to disappoint true believers, none of the new additions actually belong on that list.
  Here are their official birthdates:

  Forwarded email quotes a road-weary Barack Obama saying he has campaigned (or plans to campaign) in 'all 57 states,' and claims there are exactly fifty-seven ISLAMIC states in the world.
  Description: Email rumor / Viral quote Circulating since: June 2008 Status: Partly true (see details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by Ted B., June 12, 2008:
  From: Subject: FW: think about this
  Coincidence ?
  Hmmmmmmmmm......
  You are aware, probably, that Barack Obama lost his bearings recently and said that he was going to campaign in all 57 states. You heard this? And everybody chalked it up to, 'Well, he's tired.'
  Barack Obama says he's gonna go out and campaign in 57 states, he was just tired, you know, it's been such a long campaign, he's been so many places, he probably thinks there are 57 states. Well, I have here a printout from a website called the International Humanist and Ethical Union. And here is how the second paragraph of an article on that website begins. 'Every year from 1999 to 2005 the organization of the Islamic conference representing the 57 Islamic states presented a resolution to the United Nations commission on human rights called combating.' And the title of the piece here is, 'How the Islamic states dominate the UN human rights council,' and there are 57 of them.
  Obama said he's going to campaign in 57 states, and it turns out that there are 57 Islamic states. There are 57 Islamic states. ; ; So did Obama just lose his bearings, or was this a more telling slip, ladies and gentlemen?
  DO ALL AMERICANS A FAVOR AND FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE ON YOUR EMAIL LIST..... With our country at odds with the Muslems, what will happen if Obama is one? Think and pray before voting!

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Analysis: It's true that during a May 9, 2008 campaign stop in Oregon, Barack Obama said he had visited 57 states. The exact quote, as transcribed in the LA Times 'Top of the Ticket' blog (and viewable on YouTube ), went as follows:
  The rest of this forwarded email can be taken as either a joke or a smear, depending on how amusing one finds yet another reference to Obama's rumored secret adherence to the Muslim faith.
  Is it true there are exactly 57 Islamic states in the world? That depends on how you're counting. There are, as of this writing, exactly 57 member states in the above-mentioned Organization of the Islamic Conference, which roughly coincides with the number of countries currently boasting a Muslim majority population (estimates range from 55 to 57). But if the criterion for 'Islamic state' is full-blown Muslim rule, the number is significantly smaller than 57.
  Finally, is Barack Obama a covert Muslim? If you have to ask, you haven't been paying attention .

  Analysis: It appears one of the things Americans will have to put up with until the bigots among us get over the fact that we have an African-American President is the dissemination of racist jokes at Barack Obama's expense.
  For all the talk of the nation having entered a 'post-racial' phase as of the landmark 2008 election, it's crystal clear that racial antagonisms still exist, and won't go away overnight.
  Around the same time the above image began circulating (late February 2009), another example of blatant prejudice surfaced in the form of an Obama-themed book display in a Florida Barnes & Noble store containing a volume entitled Monkeys (for which the company apologized, saying it was a case of customer vandalism).
  It is not the case, needless to say, that either of the two customized Boeing 747 aircraft officially designated Air Force One when used by the President bears the tail number 'NI66ER' (call letters N-I-SIX-SIX-E-R). The actual tail numbers are 28000 and 29000.

  The modern nation of Iraq is built upon foundations that go back to some of humanity's earliest complex cultures. It was in Iraq, also known as Mesopotamia , that Babylonian king Hammurabi regularized the law in the Code of Hammurabi, c. 1772 BCE.
  Under Hammurabi's system, society would inflict upon a criminal the same harm that the criminal had inflicted upon his victim. This is codified in the famous dictum, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' More recent Iraqi history, however, tends to support the Mahatma Gandhi's take on this rule. He is supposed to have said that 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'
  Capital: Baghdad, population 9,500,000 (2008 estimate)
  Major cities: Mosul, 3,000,000
  Basra, 2,300,000
  Arbil, 1,294,000
  Kirkuk, 1,200,000
  The Republic of Iraq is a parliamentary democracy. The head of state is the president, currently Jalal Talabani, while the head of government is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki .

  Overview of the Iraq War
  The unicameral parliament is called the Council of Representatives; its 325 members serve four-year terms. Eight of those seats are specifically reserved for ethnic or religious minorities.
  Iraq's judiciary system consists of the Higher Judicial Council, the Federal Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Cassation, and lower courts. ('Cassation' literally means 'to quash' - it is another term for appeals, evidently taken from the French legal system.)
  Iraq has a total population of about 30.4 million. The population growth rate is an estimated 2.4%. About 66% of Iraqis live in urban areas.
  Some 75-80% of Iraqis are Arabs. Another 15-20% are Kurds , by far the largest ethnic minority; they live primarily in northern Iraq. The remaining roughly 5% of the population is made up of Turkomen, Assyrians, Armenians, Chaldeans and other ethnic groups.
  Both Arabic and Kurdish are official languages of Iraq. Kurdish is an Indo-European language related to Iranian languages.
  Minority languages in Iraq include Turkoman, which is a Turkic language; Assyrian, a Neo-Aramaic language of the Semitic language family; and Armenian, an Indo-European language with possible Greek roots. Thus, although the total number of languages spoken in Iraq is not high, the linguistic variety is great.
  Iraq is an overwhelmingly Muslim country, with an estimated 97% of the population following Islam . Perhaps unfortunately, it is also among the most even divided countries on Earth in terms of Sunni and Shi'a populations; 60 to 65% of Iraqis are Shi'a, while 32 to 37% are Sunni.
  Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni minority controlled the government, often persecuting Shi'as. Since the new constitution was implemented in 2005, Iraq is supposed to be a democratic country, but the Shi'a/Sunni split is a source of much tension as the nation sorts out a new form of government.
  Iraq also has a small Christian community, around 3% of the population. During the nearly decade-long war following the US-led invasion in 2003, many Christians fled Iraq for Lebanon , Syria, Jordan, or western countries.
  Iraq is a desert country, but it is watered by two major rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates. Only 12% of Iraq's land is arable. It controls a 58 km (36 mile) coast on the Persian Gulf, where the two rivers empty into the Indian Ocean.
  Iraq is bordered by Iran to the east, Turkey and Syria to the north, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the west, and Kuwait to the southeast. Its highest point is Cheekah Dar, a mountain in the north of the country, at 3,611 m (11,847 feet). Its lowest point is sea level.
  As a subtropical desert, Iraq experiences extreme seasonal variation in temperature. In parts of the country, July and August temperatures average over 48°C (118°F). During the rainy winter months of December through March, however, temperatures drop below freezing not infrequently. Some years, heavy mountain snow in the north produces dangerous flooding on the rivers.
  The lowest temperature recorded in Iraq was -14°C (7°F). The highest temperature was 54°C (129°F).
  Another key feature of Iraq's climate is the sharqi , a southerly wind that blows from April through early June, and again in October and November. It gusts up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), causing sand storms that can be seen from space.
  The economy of Iraq is all about oil; 'black gold' provides more than 90% of government revenue, and accounts for 80% of the country's foreign exchange income. As of 2011, Iraq was producing 1.9 million barrels per day of oil, while consuming 700,000 barrels per day domestically. (Even as it exports almost 2 million barrels per day, Iraq also imports 230,000 barrels per day.)
  Since the start of the US-led War in Iraq in 2003, foreign aid has become a major component of Iraq's economy, as well. The US has pumped some $58 billion dollars worth of aid into the country between 2003 and 2011; other nations have pledge an additional $33 billion in reconstruction aid.
  Iraq's workforce is employed primarily in the service sector, although about 15 to 22% work in agriculture. The unemployment rate is around 15%, and an estimated 25% of Iraqis live below the poverty line.
  The Iraqi currency is the dinar . As of February 2012, $1 US is equal to 1,163 dinar.
  Part of the Fertile Crescent, Iraq was one of the early sites of complex human civilization and agricultural practice. Once called Mesopotamia , Iraq was the seat of the Sumerian and Babylonian cultures c. 4,000 - 500 BCE. During this early period, Mesopotamians invented or refined technologies such as writing and irrigation; the famous King Hammurabi (r. 1792- 1750 BCE) recorded the law in the Code of Hammurabi, and over a thousand of years later, Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605 - 562 BCE) built the incredible Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
  After about 500 BCE, Iraq was ruled by a succession of Persian dynasties, such as the Achaemenids , the Parthians , the Sassanids and the Seleucids . Although local governments existed in Iraq, they were under Iranian control until the 600s CE.
  In 633, the year after the Prophet Muhammad died, a Muslim army under Khalid ibn Walid invaded Iraq. By 651, the soldiers of Islam had brought down the Sassanid Empire in Persia, and began to Islamicize the region that is now Iraq and Iran .
  Between 661 and 750, Iraq was a dominion of the Umayyad Caliphate , which ruled from Damascus (now in Syria ). The Abbasid Caliphate , which ruled the Middle East and North Africa from 750 to 1258, decided to build a new capital closer to the political power hub of Persia. It built the city of Baghdad, which became a center of Islamic art and learning.
  In 1258, catastrophe struck the Abbasids and Iraq in the form the Mongols under Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan . The Mongols demanded that Baghdad surrender, but the Caliph Al-Mustasim refused. Hulagu's troops laid siege to Baghdad, taking the city with at least 200,000 Iraqi dead. The Mongols also burned the Grand Library of Baghdad and its wonderful collection of documents - one of the great crimes of history. The caliph himself was executed by being rolled in a carpet and trampled by horses; this was an honorable death in Mongol culture, because none of the caliph's noble blood touched the ground.
  Hulagu's army would meet defeat by the Egyptian Mamluk slave-army in the Battle of Ayn Jalut . In the Mongols' wake, however, the Black Death carried away about a third of Iraq's population. In 1401, Timur the Lame (Tamerlane) captured Baghdad, and ordered another massacre of its people.
  Timur's fierce army only controlled Iraq for a few years, and was supplanted by the Ottoman Turks. The Ottoman Empire would rule Iraq from the fifteenth century through 1917, when Britain wrested the Middle East from Turkish control and the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
  Under the British/French plan to divide the Middle East, the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, Iraq became part of the British Mandate. On November 11, 1920, the region became a British mandate under the League of Nations, called the 'State of Iraq.' Britain brought in a (Sunni) Hashemite king from the region of Mecca and Medina, now in Saudi Arabia, to rule over the primarily Shi'a Iraqis and Kurds of Iraq, sparking widespread discontent and rebellion.
  In 1932, Iraq gained nominal independence from Britain, although the British-appointed King Faisal still ruled the country and the British military had special rights in Iraq. The Hashemites ruled until 1958, when King Faisal II was assassinated in a coup led by Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim. This signaled the beginning of a rule by a series of strongmen over Iraq, which lasted through 2003.
  Qasim's rule survived for just five years, before being overthrown in turn by Colonel Abdul Salam Arif in February of 1963. Three years later, Arif's brother took power after the colonel died; however, he would rule Iraq for just two years before being deposed by a Ba'ath Party-led coup in 1968. The Ba'athist government was led by Ahmed Hasan Al-Bakir at first, but he was slowly elbowed aside over the next decade by Saddam Hussein .
  Saddam Hussein formally seized power as president of Iraq in 1979. The following year, feeling threatened by rhetoric from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , new leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saddam Hussein launched an invasion of Iran that led to the eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War .
  Hussein himself was a secularist, but the Ba'ath Party was dominated by Sunnis. Khomeini hoped that Iraq's Shi'ite majority would rise up against Hussein in an Iranian Revolution -style movement, but that did not happen. With support from the Gulf Arab states and the United States, Saddam Hussein was able to fight the Iranians to a stalemate. He also took the opportunity to use chemical weapons against tens of thousands of Kurdish and Marsh Arab civilians within his own country, as well as against the Iranian troops, in blatant violation of international treaty norms and standards.
  Its economy ravaged by the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq decided to invade the small but wealthy neighboring nation of Kuwait in 1990. Saddam Hussein announced that he had annexed Kuwait; when he refused to withdraw, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to take military action in 1991 in order to oust the Iraqis. An international coalition led by the United States (which had been allied with Iraq just three years earlier) routed the Iraqi Army in a matter of months, but Saddam Hussein's troops set fire to Kuwaiti oil wells on their way out, causing an ecological disaster along the Persian Gulf coast. This fighting would come to be known as the First Gulf War .
  Following the First Gulf War, the United States patrolled a no-fly zone over the Kurdish north of Iraq to protect civilians there from Saddam Hussein's government; Iraqi Kurdistan began to function as a separate country, even while nominally still part of Iraq. Throughout the 1990s, the international community was concerned that Saddam Hussein's government was trying to develop nuclear weapons. In 1993, the US also learned that Hussein had made a plan to assassinate President George H. W. Bush during the First Gulf War. The Iraqis allowed UN weapons inspectors in to the country, but expelled them in 1998, claiming that they were CIA spies. In October of that year, US President Bill Clinton called for 'regime change' in Iraq.
  After George W. Bush became president of the United States in 2000, his administration began to prepare for a war against Iraq. Bush the younger resented Saddam Hussein's plans to kill Bush the elder, and made the case that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons despite rather flimsy evidence. The September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC gave Bush the political cover he needed to launch a Second Gulf War, even though Saddam Hussein's government had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks.
  The Iraq War began on March 20, 2003, when a US-led coalition invaded Iraq from Kuwait. The coalition drove the Ba'athist regime out of power, installing an Iraqi Interim Government in June of 2004, and organizing free elections for October of 2005. Saddam Hussein went in to hiding, but was captured by US troops on December 13, 2003. In the chaos, sectarian violence broke out across the country between the Shi'a majority and the Sunni minority; al-Qaeda seized the opportunity to establish a presence in Iraq.
  Iraq's interim government tried Saddam Hussein for the killing of Iraqi Shi'ites in 1982, and sentenced him to death. Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006. After a 'surge' of troops to quell violence in 2007-2008, the US withdrew from Baghdad in June of 2009, and left Iraq completely in December of 2011.

  If it seems like presidential campaigns begin the minute one election ends, you're not too far off. Candidates for president announce their campaigns well in advance of election year and often times begin laying the groundwork for the race years in advance.
  But how early do modern presidential candidates actually launch their campaigns?
  Related : Date of the 2016 Presidential Election
  We can learn a thing or two from when presidential candidates have made their decisions in the recent past. So let's examine how early presidential hopefuls who were successful in winning their party nominations launched their campaigns.
  We'll look at races where there was no incumbent, which will be the case in the 2016 election because President Barack Obama is serving his second and final term in the White House .
  Related : Why Presidents Can Serve Only 2 Terms
  In the four most recent presidential elections in which there was no incumbent on the ballot, the eight candidates who won their party's nomination and ran in the general election launched their campaigns an average of 531 days before the election took place.
  That's about one year and seven months before the presidential election.
  If candidates follow that pattern, they typically will begin announcing campaigns in the spring of the year before the presidential election.
  Here's a list of when the eight most recent presidential nominees have announced their candidacies in years when there was no incumbent seeking re-election to the White House.
  The 2016 presidential election is being held on Nov. 8, 2016 . There was no incumbent because President Barack Obama was finishing his second and final term .
  The Republican nominee, reality-television star and billionaire real-estate developer Donald Trump , announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015, 513 days or one year and nearly five months before the election.
  Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. senator who served as secretary of the Department of State under Obama , announced her presidential campaign on April 12, 2015, 577 days or one year and seven months before the election.
  The 2008 presidential election was held on Nov. 4, 2008. There was no incumbent because President George W. Bush was serving his second and final term.
  Democrat Obama, the eventual victor, announced he was seeking his party's nomination for the presidency on Feb. 10, 2007, 633 days or one year, 8 months and 25 days before the election.
  Related : When Are Vice Presidential Candidates Chosen?
  Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain announced his intentions to seek his party's presidential nomination on April 25 of 2007, 559 days or one year, six months and 10 days before the election.
  The 2000 presidential election was held on Nov. 7, 2000. There was no incumbent because President Bill Clinton was serving his second and final term.
  Republican George W. Bush , the eventual winner, announced he was seeking his party's presidential nomination on June 12, 1999, 514 days or one year, four months and 26 days before the election.
  Democrat Al Gore, the vice president, announced he was seeking the party's nomination for presidency on June 16, 1999, 501 days or one year, four months and 22 days before the election.
  The 1988 presidential election was held on Nov. 8, 1988. There was no incumbent because President Ronald Reagan was serving his second and final term.
  Republican George H.W. Bush , who was vice president at the time, announced he was seeking the party's presidential nomination on Oct. 13, 1987, 392 days or one year and 26 days before the election.
  Democrat Michael Dukakis announced he was seeking his party's presidential nomination on April 29, 1987, 559 days or one year, six months and 10 days before the election.

"The Revocation of Independence","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/revocation_a.htm","Notice of Revocation of Independence","2005-02-22 21:43:06","  By David Emery
  Introduction
  IF NOTHING else, the interminable U.S. presidential election of 2000 yielded inspirational fodder for humorists everywhere, and not just those fortunate enough to host late-night talk shows or write syndicated newspaper columns. To date, some of the funniest jabs at America's electoral follies have come not from the likes of Dave Letterman and Dave Barry, but from ordinary folks creatively venting their frustration via that quintessentially populist medium known as the Internet.
  Thanks to email, blogs and message boards, homespun humorists can now command ad hoc audiences numbering in the millions. If, as they say, laughter is the best medicine, then this is a wholesome cultural development. Comedy is too important to be left to the professionals.
  Notice of Revocation of Independence
  One of the cleverest bits to flood the email circuit in November 2000 was the 'Notice of Revocation of Independence,' a sarcastic proclamation reasserting Great Britain's sovereignty over the U.S. due to the latter's evident inability to govern itself ( full text ).

  Highest Paid Male Actors Ever
  Among the 'new rules' it says Americans must adhere to are:
  • Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys.
  • You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde.
  • July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called 'Indecisive Day.'
  As is typical of folk humor, there are numerous versions of the text in circulation comprising the work of more than one anonymous author (not to mention at least two anonymous responses on behalf of America). Although it is rare for such texts to be traceable to a single point of origin, we are blessed to have a fairly precise outline of the genesis of this one thanks to Sarah Hartwell, an amateur folklorist from Chelmsford, England.
  Variants and history
  We offer, first, a tour of the several known variants of the 'Revocation of Independence,' concluding with Ms. Hartwell's commentary:

  What follows is a slightly edited version of an original commentary by Sarah Hartwell. It contains all the information we have to date and is accurate to the best of our knowledge, but we recognize there may be gaps in the story and welcome any corrections or additions.
  Origin
  The 'Notice of Revocation of Independence' was originally posted 8th November, 2000 by Alan Baxter (Rochester, U.K.) on an internal newsgroup of a company which spans the U.K., U.S. and Australia. I work for the same company and use the same newsgroups so I got to see the early versions of the 'Revocation' and find out about its history. After a few more additions, extending a four-point item to a 10-point and then a 13-point item , Peter Rieden (Farnborough, U.K.) mailed the 'Revocation' to the external newsgroup sci.military.naval on 15th November to entertain American subscribers during off-topic discussion of election issues. Peter's line of work is in seaborne defense systems.

  5 Urban Myths That Rule the Ages
  Peter expected to be flamed or email-bombed for his contribution, but the following day, the 'Revocation' was sent out as a joke-of-the-day and appeared in email inboxes and newsgroups worldwide. Upon a few more refining comments (added by other individuals) it became the article which was emailed around the world.
  Authorship
  Peter Rieden doesn't claim authorship of the various versions currently in circulation although he has been identified as a co-author of the original version. He claims that the version he mailed to sci.military.naval had 10 items in the 'list of things you must do' and had been forwarded to him from a friend at Warton, U.K. (Warton is another company site, so the 'Revocation' was already doing the rounds within the company). Peter subsequently posted his own revised version (to which he had added three more items in the list) elsewhere on worldwide Usenet and this second version began doing the rounds as well. As far as Peter can remember, the originator of the idea (but not the actual text) was the BBC Radio Four Today program (06:30 to 09:00 morning news program).
  On Thursday 16th it appeared on the BBC News Website. On Sunday 19th November, the 'Revocation of Independence' was mentioned on the 09:00 U.K. ITV News. On 20th November I received the ' Notice of Annexation of the UK ' by email. It seems to originate from within the same company, but was not authored by Baxter and Rieden. On Tuesday 21st , the email version of 'Revocation' was read out in full on BBC Radio Merseyside and appeared on the front page of the prestigious U.K. newspaper, The Times, in the article 'Who Wants to Be a President?' which read: 'The latest bumper sticker reads 'Screw this I'm moving to Canada' and an internet proclamation suggests that as America's 224-year experiment with independence seems to be in chaos, it may be time for Her Majesty to take over again.'
  Notoriety
  On 20th November one of the credited authors, Peter Rieden, wrote to the company newsgroup where the Revocation first appeared that the 'Revocation of Independence' had proven to be something of an embarrassment. He had received some 200 emails from overseas subscribers (including Americans) to the jokes mailing list, all along the lines of 'ROFLMAO.' There had not been a single negative response. By this time, recipients were adding their own personal thoughts to the 'Notice of Revocation,' leading to multiple versions in circulation. The 'Revocation' had become email lore and references (citations) and excerpts were appearing in online and hard-copy publications. It was also being discussed on Usenet, a Yahoo site and About.com's Urban Legends forum. Most versions have 10 or 12 points, though these vary between versions. The most common variant has 15 points and is a compilation of five or six different versions. In December 2004 the 15-point text resurfaced, this time attributed to former Monty Python member John Cleese. Clearly, however, he was not its author, and has said so on his website.
  A spur-of-the-moment internal newsgroup posting inspired by an off-the-cuff comment by a Radio Four presenter has sparked one of the best political parodies on the Internet in recent times.

"Religion Banned on White House Christmas Tree Ornaments","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/white_house_christmas_ornaments.htm","'Holiday Tree' Instead of Christmas Tree at the White House This Year?","2009-10-05 17:12:45","  By David Emery
  Viral message claims the Obamas will have 'holiday trees' instead of Christmas trees in the White House, and religious-themed ornaments are forbidden.
  Description: Online rumor Circulating since: July 2009 Status: False (details below)
  Example: Email text contributed by an AOL user, August 2, 2009:
  Hello all,
  Thought you might be interested in this information from the White House. This isn't a rumor; this is a fact.
  We have a friend at church who is a very talented artist. For several years she, among many others, has painted ornaments to be hung on the various White House Christmas trees. The WH sends out an invitation to send an ornament and informs the artists of the theme for the year.
  She got her letter from the WH recently. It said that they would not be called Christmas trees this year. They will be called Holiday trees. And, to please not send any ornaments painted with a religious theme.
  She was very upset at this development and sent back a reply telling them that she painted the ornaments for Christmas trees and would not be sending any for display that left Christ out of Christmas.
  Just thought you should know what the new residents in the WH plan for the future of America. If you missed his statement that 'we do not consider ourselves a Christian Nation' this should confirm that he plans to take us away from our religious foundation as quickly as possible.

  Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming
  2015 update: The 2015 holiday season at the White House officially began on Nov. 27 as Michelle Obama received this year's Christmas tree .
  2014 update: Michelle Obama and daughters took delivery of this year's official Christmas tree on Nov. 28.
  2013 update: The 2013 White House Christmas tree, an 18 1/2-foot high and nearly 11-foot wide Douglas fir, was delivered to the First Lady on Nov. 29.
  2012 update: The 2012 White House Christmas tree, clearly labeled as such, was delivered to Michelle Obama at the North Portico of the White House on Nov. 23, 2012.
  2011 update: As of November 2011, this two-year-old email is circulating yet again. It did not suddenly become true in the intervening months. The White House Christmas tree, clearly marked as such , was delivered to Michelle Obama on Nov. 25.
  2010 update: As of December 2010, the same year-old email was circulating again, identically worded but now titled 'White House Will Not Do Christmas,' 'No Christmas Tree in the White House This Year,' etc. It's still false.
  Analysis: [2009] The viral message is completely false. Apart from an announcement last August that an 18- to 19-foot Fraser fir from Shepherdstown, West Virginia will serve as the official White House Christmas Tree — Christmas tree, please note, not ' holiday tree' — there have been no revelations to date regarding First Lady Michelle Obama's plans for decorating the Executive Mansion for the 2009 holidays.
  Moreover, we have only this one anonymous, secondhand account to support the claim that artists who have contributed White House Christmas ornaments in the past were invited to do so again in 2009 and told to limit their submissions to non-religious designs. This is doubtful, if for no other reason than that it does not appear to be the case that the same artists are asked to contribute from one year to the next. In 2008, for example, Laura Bush asked each member of Congress to select an artist from their home district; in 2007, each National Park site was asked to designate a local artist; in 2006, submissions were restricted to craft artisans; and so on.
  In any case, White House sources say that as yet no invitations have been sent out to ornament makers for 2009.
  It's possible these rumors surrounding the White House Christmas tree were sparked by a controversy surrounding decorative guidelines for a different official tree, the Capitol Christmas Tree, which is displayed every holiday season on the West Front lawn of the U.S. Capitol. Each year the federal government selects a different state to supply a 50- to 85-foot-tall Capitol Tree and several dozen smaller specimens for distribution around Washington, D.C., and citizens of the chosen state are invited to contribute handmade ornaments.
  In 2009, objections were raised when it was noted that the Capitol Christmas Tree guidelines stipulated that ornaments contributed by citizens 'may not reflect religious or political themes.' Threatening a first-amendment lawsuit, Christian and conservative groups called on the U.S. Forest Service, which sponsors the program, to rescind the ban.
  According to a Forest Service spokesman quoted by ABC News, the language prohibiting religious themes came from 'old information' on the Capitol Tree website. That information has since been revised.
  In point of fact, online documents show that a ban on religious-themed ornaments was in effect during the Bush administration ( 2007 and 2008 ), though, curiously, no religious groups objected at the time.

"Rice for Peace","http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/backgroundhistory/tp/bushdidright.htm","Middle East Countries With Nuclear Weapons","2013-11-13 16:11:26","  By Primoz  Manfreda
  Israel is the Middle East’s principal nuclear power, though it has never officially acknowledged possession of nuclear weapons. According to a 2013 report by US experts , Israel’s nuclear arsenal includes 80 nuclear warheads, with enough fissile material potentially to double that number. Israel is not a member of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and parts of its nuclear research program are off limits to the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
  Proponents of regional nuclear disarmament point to a contradiction between Israel’s nuclear capacity and insistence by its leaders that Washington stops Iran’s nuclear program – with force, if necessary. But Israel’s advocates say nuclear weapons are a key deterrent against demographically stronger Arab neighbors and Iran. This deterrent capacity would of course be compromised if Iran managed to enrich uranium to the level where it too could produce nuclear warheads. More »
  We often count Pakistan as part of the wider Middle East, but the country’s foreign policy is better understood in the South Asian geopolitical context and the hostile relationship between Pakistan and India. Pakistan successfully tested nuclear weapons in 1998, narrowing the strategic gap with India which conducted its first test in the 1970s. Western observers have often voiced concerns over the safety of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal , particularly regarding the influence of radical Islamism in the Pakistani intelligence apparatus, and the reported sales of enrichment technology to North Korea and Libya.
  While Pakistan never played an active role in the Arab-Israeli conflict, its relationship with Saudi Arabia could yet place Pakistani nuclear weapons at the center of Middle Eastern power struggles. Saudi Arabia has provided Pakistan with generous financial largesse as part of efforts to contain Iran’s regional influence, and some of that money could have been ended up bolstering Pakistan’s nuclear program.
  But a BBC report in November 2013 claimed that cooperation went much deeper. In exchange for assistance, Pakistan may have agreed to provide Saudi Arabia with nuclear protection if Iran developed nuclear weapons, or threatened the kingdom in any other way. Many analysts remain skeptical of whether an actual transfer of nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia was logistically feasible, and whether Pakistan would risk angering the West again by exporting its nuclear know-how.
  Just how close Iran is to reaching weapons capacity has been the subject of endless speculation. Iran’s official position is that its nuclear research is aimed for peaceful purposes only, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – Iran’s most powerful official – has even issued religious decrees slamming possession of nuclear weapons as contrary to the principles of Islamic faith. Israeli leaders believe that the regime in Tehran has both intent and ability, unless the international community takes tougher action.
  The middle view would be that Iran uses the implicit threat of uranium enrichment as a diplomatic card in the hope of extracting concessions from the West on other fronts. That is, Iran might be willing to scale down its nuclear program if given certain security guarantees by the US, and if international sanctions were eased.
  That said, Iran’s complex power structures consist of numerous ideological factions and business lobbies, and some hardliners would no doubt be willing to push for weapons capacity even for the price of unprecedented tension with the West and Gulf Arab states. If Iran does decide to produce a bomb, the outside world probably doesn’t have too many options. Layers upon layers of US and European sanctions have battered but failed to bring down Iran’s economy, and the course of military action would be extremely risky. More »

"Ronald Reagan: Grace Under the Scalpel","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/historical/a/ronald_reagan.htm","Ronald Reagan: Grace Under the Scalpel","2004-06-06 17:08:03","  I RECEIVED a note from reader Mike Ambrose, whose comments inspired an intriguing course of research into events following would-be assassin John Hinckley's attempt on Ronald Reagan's life in 1981:
  So, what's the truth of the matter? Notwithstanding media reports at the time, it's now clear from eyewitness testimony (including that of Reagan himself) that the gravely wounded President was indeed only semi-conscious at best as he was wheeled into the emergency room after the assassination attempt . In his memoir, An American Life , Reagan remembers:
  But it's also true that fully an hour went by between the moment Reagan was delivered to the emergency room and when he was anesthetized for surgery — time enough for him to regain enough composure to utter the famous quip.
  In fact, by all accounts, Reagan turned into a veritable joke machine during the hour-long wait.
  'All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia'
  The first words he uttered upon regaining consciousness were to a nurse who happened to be holding the president's hand. 'Does Nancy know about us?' he quipped.
  When Nancy herself arrived a few minutes later, Reagan greeted her with the comment, 'Honey, I forgot to duck.' (He was quoting prizefighter Jack Dempsey, who had said the same thing to his own wife after losing the heavyweight championship to rival Gene Tunney in 1926.)
  Reagan even found occasion to pay homage to W.C. Fields. When a nurse asked him how he was feeling, he responded, 'All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.' (The original line, which Fields had proposed for his own epitaph, was: 'On the whole, I would rather be in Philadelphia.')
  And, according to Edwin Meese, Reagan's Attorney General, the President stumped him and other members of the White House staff with the greeting, 'Who's minding the store?' (Fortunately, no one told him it was Al 'I'm in charge here' Haig.)
  But the coup de grace, the witticism most repeated and best remembered from that day, was delivered by the President as he was being moved from gurney to operating table just before surgery.
  That he looked up at his surgeons and jokingly expressed the hope they were Republicans has been confirmed by eyewitnesses, and is pretty much beyond doubt. But the precise words he used vary depending upon who is telling the tale:
  None of the above are firsthand accounts, of course. And although we might hope and expect to find more agreement in the testimonies of those who were actually present in the operating room, alas, we do not.
  The head surgeon speaks
  Dr. Joseph Giordano, who headed the George Washington University Hospital trauma team that operated on Reagan, recollected the incident in a Los Angeles Times article just a few days after it happened. His version of events, corroborated by Reagan's personal physician, who was also in the room, was later recapped in Herbert L. Abrams' book, The President Has Been Shot , as follows:
  Reagan's own version, reported years later in his memoir, An American Life , differs only slightly, though in a manner that's especially interesting from a storytelling perspective:
  On the question of credibility, let's be frank. The surgeon, Giordano, was lucid, focused and in command when this incident took place; President Reagan, by all accounts including his own, was weak and groggy. Giordano told the story less than a week after it happened; Reagan didn't write it down until many years later. The odds favor Giordano.
  That's show biz
  But consider, if it were up to you to choose one and only one verbatim account, which you would want for a screenplay of these events:
  It's a no-brainer. As a set-up for Giordano's response, Reagan's line works far better when phrased in the singular and addressed to the head surgeon alone. Indeed, the whole couplet, as rendered by the President, evinces a polish that only an expert storyteller could give it, while Giordano's version comes across as clunky, but, well... real.
  They didn't call Reagan 'The Great Communicator ' for nothing.

"Rumsfeld to Kennedy: 'You're All Wet'","http://history1900s.about.com/od/1960s/a/Chappaquiddick.htm","Ted Kennedy and the Chappaquiddick Accident","2013-03-12 17:37:28","  Around midnight on the night of July 18-19, 1969, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy had left a party and was driving his black Oldsmobile sedan when it went off a bridge and landed in Poucha Pond on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. Kennedy survived the accident but his passenger, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, did not. Kennedy fled the scene and did not report the accident for nearly ten hours.
  Although Ted Kennedy was subjected to a subsequent investigation and proceedings, he was not charged with causing Kopechne’s death; a point that many contend was a direct result of Kennedy-family connections. The Chappaquiddick incident remained a scar on Ted Kennedy’s reputation and thus prevented him from making a serious run at becoming president of the United States .
  Edward Moore Kennedy , better known as Ted, graduated from the University of Virginia Law School in 1959 and then followed in his older brother John’s footsteps when he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts in November 1962.

  What are the Seven Wonders of the World
  By 1969, Ted Kennedy was married with three children and was lining himself up to become a presidential candidate, just like his older brothers John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy had done before him. The events on the night of July 18-19 would change those plans.
  It had been just over a year since the assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy ; so Ted Kennedy and his cousin, Joseph Gargan, planned a small reunion for a few, select individuals who had worked on RFK’s campaign.
  The get-together was scheduled for Friday and Saturday, July 18-19, 1969, on the island of Chappaquiddick (located just to the east of Martha’s Vineyard ), coinciding with the area’s annual sailing regatta. The small get-together was to be a cookout with barbecued steaks, hors d’oeuvres, and drinks held at a rented house called Lawrence Cottage.
  Kennedy arrived around 1 pm on July 18 and then raced in the regatta with his boat Victoria until about 6 pm. After checking into his hotel, the Shiretown Inn in Edgartown (on the island of Martha’s Vineyard), Kennedy changed his clothes, crossed the channel that separated the two islands via a ferry, and arrived around 7:30 pm at the Cottage on Chappaquiddick. Most of the other guests arrived by 8:30 pm for the party.
  Among those at the party were a group of six young women known as the “boiler room girls,” as their desks had been located in the mechanical room of the campaign building. These young women had bonded during their experience on the campaign and looked forward to reuniting on Chappaquiddick. One of these young women was 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne.
  Shortly after 11 pm, Kennedy announced his intentions to leave the party. His chauffeur, John Crimmins, was still finishing his dinner so, although it was extremely rare for Kennedy to drive himself, he asked Crimmins for the car keys, reportedly so he could leave on his own.
  Kennedy claimed that Kopechne asked him to give her a ride back to her hotel when he mentioned he was leaving. Ted Kennedy and Mary Jo Kopechne got into Kennedy’s car together; Kopechne told no one where she was going and left her pocketbook at the Cottage.
  The exact details of what happened next are largely unknown. After the incident, Kennedy stated that he thought he was heading toward the ferry; however, instead of turning left from the main road to head to the ferry, Kennedy had turned right, driving down the unpaved Dyke Road, which ended at a secluded beach. Along this road was the old Dyke Bridge, which did not contain a guardrail.
  Traveling approximately 20 miles per hour, Kennedy missed the slight turn to the left needed to make it safely onto and across the bridge. His 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88 went off the right side of the bridge and plunged into Poucha Pond, where it landed upside down in about eight to ten feet of water.
  Somehow, Kennedy was able to free himself from the vehicle and swim to shore, where he claimed that he called out for Kopechne.
  Per his description of events, Kennedy then made several attempts to reach her in the vehicle but soon exhausted himself. After resting, he walked back to the Cottage, where he asked for help from Joseph Gargan and Paul Markham.
  Gargan and Markham returned to the scene with Kennedy and made additional attempts to rescue Kopechne. When they were unsuccessful, they took Kennedy to the ferry landing and left him there, assuming he was going back to Edgartown to report the accident.
  Gargan and Markham returned to the party and did not contact the authorities because they believed Kennedy was about to do so.
  Later testimony by Ted Kennedy claims that instead of taking the ferry across the channel between the two islands (it had stopped working around midnight), he swam across. After eventually reaching the other side utterly exhausted, Kennedy walked to his hotel. He still did not report the accident.
  The next morning, around 8:00 am, Kennedy met Gargan and Markham at his hotel and told them that he hadn’t yet reported the accident because he “somehow believed that when the sun came up and it was a new morning that what had happened the night before would not have happened and did not happen.”*
  Even then, Kennedy did not go to the police. Instead, Kennedy returned to Chappaquiddick so that he could make a private phone call to an old friend, hoping to ask for advice. Only then did Kennedy take the ferry back to Edgartown and report the accident to the police, doing so just before 10 am (nearly ten hours after the accident).
  The police, however, already knew about the accident. Before Kennedy made his way to the police station, a fisherman had spotted the overturned car and contacted the authorities. At approximately 9 am, a diver brought Kopechne’s body to the surface.
  One week after the accident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. He was sentenced to two months in prison; however, the prosecution agreed to suspend the sentence upon the defense attorney’s request based on Kennedy’s age and reputation for community service.
  That evening, July 25, 1969, Ted Kennedy delivered a brief speech that was televised nationally by several television networks. He began by sharing his reasons for being in Martha’s Vineyard and noted that the only reason his wife did not accompany him was due to health issues (she was in the midst of a difficult pregnancy at that time; she later miscarried).
  He went on to share that there was no reason to suspect himself and Kopechne of immoral conduct, as Kopechne (and the other “boiler room girls”) were all of impeccable character.
  Kennedy also stated that the events surrounding the accident were somewhat cloudy; however, he distinctly recalled making specific efforts to save Kopechne, both alone and with the assistance of Garghan and Markham. Still, Kennedy himself described his inaction of not calling for the police immediately as “indefensible.”
  After relaying his take on the sequence of events that occurred that night, Kennedy stated that he was considering resigning from the U.S. Senate. He hoped the people of Massachusetts would give him advice and help him decide.
  Kennedy ended the speech by quoting a passage from John F. Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage and then implored that he be able to move on and make further contributions to the well-being of society.
  In January 1970, six months after the accident, an inquest into Mary Jo Kopechne’s death occurred, with Judge James A. Boyle presiding. The inquest was kept secret at the request of Kennedy’s lawyers.
  Boyle found Kennedy negligent of unsafe driving and could have provided support for a possible charge of manslaughter; however, the district attorney, Edmund Dinis, chose not to press charges. Findings from the inquest were released that spring.
  In April 1970, a grand jury was called to examine the events surrounding the night of July 18-19. The grand jury was advised by Dinis that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on charges related to the incident. They did call four witnesses who had not testified previously; however, they ultimately decided not to indict Kennedy on any charges.
  Aside from the tarnish on his reputation, the only immediate impact of this incident on Ted Kennedy was a temporary suspension of his driver’s license, ending in November 1970. This inconvenience would pale in comparison to the effects on his reputation.
  Kennedy, himself, noted shortly after the incident that he would not run for the Democratic nomination in the 1972 presidential election campaign as a result of the event. It is also believed by many historians to have prevented him from a run in 1976.
  In 1979, Kennedy began the motions towards challenging incumbent Jimmy Carter for the Democratic Party nomination. Carter selectively referenced the incident at Chappaquiddick and Kennedy ended up losing to him during the primary campaign.
  Despite a lack of momentum towards the office of president, Ted Kennedy was successfully reelected to the Senate seven more times. In 1970, one year after Chappaquiddick, Kennedy was reelected by winning 62% of the vote.
  Throughout his tenure, Kennedy was recognized as an advocate for the economically less fortunate, a supporter of civil rights, and a huge proponent of universal health care.
  He died in 2009 at the age of 77; his death the result of a malignant brain tumor .

"Rush Limbaugh on Compensation of 9/11 Victims vs. Military Families","http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_rush_limbaugh.htm","Rush Limbaugh on Compensation of 9/11 Victims vs. Military Families","2015-05-11 17:26:36","  Description: Email flier Circulating since: April 2002 Status: Authentic (this version)
  Email example contributed by Dwight M., Apr. 12, 2002:
  The Truth Is
  Rush Limbaugh
  I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the September 11th casualty and those who die serving the country in uniform are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country.
  If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million. If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000, direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt.
  Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185, million up to $4.7 million, are complaining that it's not enough.
  We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11th families are getting.
  In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well. You see where this is going, don't you? Folks, this is part and parcel of over 50 years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad.
  Analysis: The above text, which went into email circulation in April 2002, has been confirmed by Rush Limbaugh as an accurate transcription of a monologue he delivered on his radio show March 11, 2002.
  Another version includes inaccurate remarks concerning Congressional pensions and Social Security which were not written or spoken by Limbaugh. The apocryphal comments were lifted from an unrelated email flier circulating since 2000.
  Limbaugh's figures above are roughly correct. As of June 2004, the compensation paid out to surviving family members of civilians who died in the 9/11 terrorist attack averaged $2 million per victim. By contrast, the families of American military personnel killed in combat typically receive a lump sum of $12,000 (as of November 2003; the amount was $6,000 when Limbaugh delivered his monologue in 2002), a burial allowance of up to $3,000, and ongoing monthly payments of $833 and $211 for surviving spouses and dependent children under 18 years of age, respectively.

  Americans for a More American America
  Analysis: Only the first sentence of the above quotation, widely attributed to Republican presidential primary candidate Rick Santorum , was actually uttered by him. The rest is fictitious and amounts to a caricature of his views.
  For example, though he does, as a conservative Catholic, generally oppose pornography and 'homosexual acts' (which he distinguishes from a 'homosexual orientation') — both of which he says harm the institutions of marriage and the family — Santorum has never claimed that gay pornography is 'the reason people choose the gay lifestyle,' nor that if gay pornography were banned 'homosexuality would be gone within a matter of months.' Nor has he ever claimed to 'see eye-to-eye with the Taliban' on anything.
  He has, however, indicated support for state anti-sodomy laws prohibiting homosexual behavior. And though Santorum has not, in so many words, vowed to 'ban' all pornography, he has effectively promised to do so if elected President, stating that he would appoint an Attorney General who will 'vigorously enforce' existing federal obscenity laws prohibiting the distribution of hardcore pornography.
  Actual Rick Santorum statements on pornography:
  'America is suffering a pandemic of harm from pornography. A wealth of research is now available demonstrating that pornography causes profound brain changes in both children and adults, resulting in widespread negative consequences. Addiction to pornography is now common for adults and even for some children. The average age of first exposure to hard-core, Internet pornography is now 11. Pornography is toxic to marriages and relationships. It contributes to misogyny and violence against women. It is a contributing factor to prostitution and sex trafficking.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  'Every family must now be concerned about the harm from pornography. As a parent, I am concerned about the widespread distribution of illegal obscene pornography and its profound effects on our culture.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  'The Obama Administration has turned a blind eye to those who wish to preserve our culture from the scourge of pornography and has refused to enforce obscenity laws. While the Obama Department of Justice seems to favor pornographers over children and families, that will change under a Santorum Administration.' [Source: RickSantorum.com]
  Actual Rick Santorum statements on homosexuality:
  'I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts. As I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. I have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who's homosexual. If that's their orientation, then I accept that. And I have no problem with someone who has other orientations. The question is, do you act upon those orientations? So it's not the person, it's the person's actions. And you have to separate the person from their actions.' [ Source: Associated Press interview ]
  'We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.' [ Source: Associated Press interview ]

  Analysis: No such incident occurred. The text and photo above originated in a satirical (i.e., fictitious) article published on the humor website The Daily Currant on Jan. 29, 2013.
  Allow me to direct your attention to the disclaimer prominently displayed on the ' About ' page of The Daily Currant :
  Q. Are your newstories [sic] real?
  A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world
  Allow me to also direct your attention to the name of the alleged TSA spokesperson quoted in the article: ' Dirk Diggler .' (Did anyone here see Boogie Nights ?)
  It's true that Ann Coulter is famously outspoken and that as a conservative she holds the view that affirmative action programs are unjust and unnecessary, but so far as I'm aware those views have never caused her to erupt in a screaming fit on a crowded airliner.

  2000 version: Email contributed by Burnell Y., Dec. 21, 2000:
  Analysis: This misleading assemblage of facts and figures was somewhat accurate when it first began circulating in 2000 but became entirely false when it reappeared verbatim in 2004, citing precisely the same data under the pretext of interpreting that years' election results. Needless to say, those numbers are also inaccurate for 2008 and 2012.
  Comparing the email's statistics to those reported by USA Today and Associated Press , we find some of the claims to be roughly correct for Nov. 2000:
  When it comes to the Average Murder Rates per 100,000 in the counties won by Gore vs. those won by Bush, however, the figures in the email were either erroneously calculated or outright fabricated. Since the actual numbers are available as raw data only from government sources, I'll rely on some number-crunching previously done by David Mikkelson of Snopes.com based on Dept. of Justice data from 1999 and 2000:
  There's a difference, as you can plainly see, but the actual discrepancy between the murder rates of the two voting blocs is much smaller than the 13.2 per 100,000 (Gore) vs. 2.1 per 100,000 (Bush) reported in the text.
  Prof. Joseph Olson of 'Hemline' University There is a Professor Joseph Olson at the Hamline University School of Law (misspelled 'Hemline University' in some versions of the viral text), but he had nothing to do with the writing of this text or any of the data it contains. 'It is entirely BOGUS as to my authorship,' he wrote years ago on his Hamline faculty page . 'I have been trying to kill it since December 2000.' Obviously without success.
  'In aggregate,' the text misquotes Olson as saying, 'the map of the territory Bush won was (mostly) the land owned by the tax-paying citizens of this great country. Gore's territory encompassed those citizens living in government-owned tenements and living off government welfare....' Not only is that patently false, not only did Olson not say it, the statement smacks of partisan smear-mongering to boot.
  It's an intentional slap in the face to the roughly half of all U.S. citizens who voted Democratic in the 2000 election, and who are painted in this email as murderous, tenement-dwelling welfare leeches. Small wonder the actual author did not see fit to sign his or her own name. The Fall of the Athenian Republic Some versions of the email quote a passage attributed to Scottish history professor 'Alexander Tyler' asserting that great civilizations always progress through a series of stages beginning with bondage, peaking in a state of liberty and abundance, then devolving through complacency and apathy back to to bondage again. Democracies fail when voters learn they can 'vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.' This was supposedly the fate of the Athenian Republic, and, by implication, will be America's.
  For the record, the professor's name was actually Alexander Tytler , and though he was indeed an accomplished 18th-century author, historian, and lawyer of 19th-century Scotland, his authorship of the passage, which doesn't seem to have appeared anywhere in print prior to the 20th century, is very much in doubt.

  Synopsis: A viral message circulating since the 2008 presidential election alleges that the hoax-debunking website Snopes.com is 'owned by a flaming liberal' who is 'in the tank for Obama' and can't be trusted to provide unbiased information. Is it true? Has anyone offered proof to back it up?
  Description: Viral text / Email rumor Circulating since: Oct. 2008 Status: Unsubstantiated (see details below)
  Rumor example: Email text contributed by Elliott F., Oct. 20, 2008:
  Analysis: Apparently it never occurred to this anonymous emailer to cite even one actual instance of Snopes.com promulgating 'half-truths' or 'lies' under the guise of providing reliable information. So much for credibility (the emailer's, I mean).
  It's doubly ironic that an attack like this should be mounted against the oldest and most respected fact-checking site on the Internet at the denouement of an election year (2008) marked from beginning to end by unrestrained smear-mongering, much of which it fell to Snopes.com to debunk.
  Let's examine the accusations.
  A subsequent variant of this rumor purports to describe a verified instance of political bias on the part of Snopes.com:
  Example: Excerpt from forwarded email received Oct. 29, 2008:
  As claimed, the Snopes.com page in question concerns a political (anti-Obama) sign erected by Mandeville, Louisiana State Farm Insurance agent Bud Gregg. And Snopes.com indeed states that Mr. Gregg was asked by State Farm's corporate office to remove the sign. But whereas the above text asserts that 'nothing of the sort ever took place,' State Farm has confirmed in writing that, in fact, 'Management requested the sign be removed as soon as its presence became known.'
  It's clear based on the actual evidence, then, that the Mikkelsons did contact State Farm headquarters during the course of their investigation, and did accurately report that the company requested removal of the sign. According to David Mikkelson, they also attempted to contact Gregg personally via email but never received a reply (source: FactCheck.org ).
  No one is immune to error, and that includes the folks who run Snopes.com, TruthorFiction.com, and even, God knows, yours truly.
  Reader, if you take nothing else away from this commentary, at least pay heed to this one important point: no information source is infallible. Whether it be an urban legends website, the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , or the Encyclopedia Britannica , mistakes can be made, nuances missed, or unconscious biases unleashed at any point in the fact-checking process.
  Rule of thumb: Wherever possible, avoid depending on any single source of information, no matter how esteemed its reputation or how reliable it has proven in the past.
  To quote Snopes.com's own Barbara Mikkelson, 'It's just as much a mistake to look to a usually-reliable source to do all of the thinking, judging, and weighing as it was to unquestioningly believe every unsigned email that came along.'
  In the thorny search for truth, there's no substitute for doing one's own research and applying one's own considered judgment before thinking oneself informed. That's an unbiased fact.

"Save NPR and PBS (It's Real This Time)","http://usconservatives.about.com/od/economytaxes/a/The-Case-For-De-Funding-Public-Broadcasting.htm","IRS Budget Cuts Will Hurt Taxpayers, Says OMB","2015-06-21 10:35:32","  By Robert Longley
  The Obama administration’s top budget analyst has warned Congress that cutting the Internal Revenue Service’s budget would end up costing the federal government far more than it would save.
  In a letter to the House Appropriations Committee , Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shaun Donovan said that further cuts to tax agency’s budget would only worsen the IRS’ already “unacceptable” levels of taxpayer services and increase the risk of theft of taxpayers’ personal information .
  “Additional funding cuts would come on top of the drastic cuts already enacted since 2010,” thus leaving the IRS with a lower operating budget than it had in 1991 “when there were 38 million fewer individual taxpayers and a far less complicated tax code ,” wrote Donovan.
  [ Staff Cuts Destroying IRS Taxpayer Service ]
  The proposed IRS budget cuts are part of the 2016 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill and would leave the IRS with a $10.1 billion 2016 budget, a cut of $838 million below the fiscal year 2015 level and $2.8 billion below the President Obama’s budget request.​
  The House Appropriations Committee approved the bill for consideration by the full House by party-line vote of 30-20 on June 17.
  “Every day, Americans are making tough decisions about their own budgets and rightfully expect federal agencies to do the same,” said House Financial Services Subcommittee Chairman Ander Crenshaw (R-Florida) adding, that the bill “holds the Administration and the Internal Revenue Service more accountable to the taxpayer.”
  In his letter, OMB Director Donovan warned lawmakers that the budget cuts would greatly reduce the IRS’ ability to collect delinquent and underpaid taxes, thus increasing the U.S. tax gap .
  “As a result of funding cuts that have already occurred to date, IRS enforcement revenues this year are expected to be $7 billion to $8 billion lower than if 2010 funding levels had been sustained,” he wrote. “These are taxes that are already owed under current law, but will go uncollected because the IRS lacks the resources needed to track down tax cheats and make sure large multinational corporations, the wealthiest, and ordinary American workers all play by the same rules.”
  “During FY 2015, as a result of funding cuts already enacted, the IRS will lose approximately 1,800 key enforcement personnel that it cannot replace,” added Donovan. “These individuals are vital to ensuring that the tax code is administered fairly.”
  Further budget cuts would also force the IRS to provide an even worse level of service to taxpayers than it is now, which Donovan admits is as bad as it has ever been.
  “This fiscal year, the IRS will answer fewer than half as many taxpayer calls as in FY 2010, with less than 4 out of every 10 callers reaching a live assistor and an estimated 28 million calls going unanswered,” he wrote. “So far this fiscal year, more than 11 million callers have either been automatically disconnected by the system due to unmanageable call volume or chose to hang up while they were on hold.”
  Last but far from least, Donovan warned lawmakers that deeper budget cuts would further reduce the IRS’ ability to protect taxpayers’ personal information from hackers.
  According to Donovan’s letter, the IRS is already three upgrades to its security software behind and a “lack of support for the IRS’s technology infrastructure would mean further deferral of cybersecurity and infrastructure upgrades, jeopardizing the strong defenses IRS needs,” he wrote.
  “The bill would also bring a halt to progress on key projects, including expansion of the specialized Criminal Investigation Identity Theft Clearinghouse that processes identity theft leads and other improvements, which would enable the IRS to detect and quickly resolve tax return anomalies that can signal identity theft ,” Donovan concluded.
  So this is prime example of how the federal budget process really works. The president requests a lot of money for each Executive Branch agency. Then, based more on politics than sound financial policy, Congress gives some agencies less and some agencies more than the president requested. And that system is why the U.S. government will be going $474 billion in the hole in 2016 .

  The original Pledge of Allegiance, 'I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it stands -- One nation indivisible -- with liberty and justice for all,' was written in September of 1892 by Francis Bellamy for 'The Youth's Companion' magazine in Boston. The phrase was printed on leaflets and sent to schools throughout the United States.
  The first organized use of the Pledge of Allegiance came on Oct. 12, 1892, when some 12 million American school children recited it to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus .
  In 1923, the first National Flag Conference in Washington D.C . voted to change the words 'my flag' to 'the Flag of the United States of America.'
  The U.S. Congress officially recognized the Pledge of Allegiance in 1942, but in 1943, the Supreme Court ruled that public school students could not be forced to recite it.
  The words 'under God' were added in 1954 by then President Eisenhower , who stated at the time, 'In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.'
  'I pledge allegiance to the Flag, of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, One Nation under God Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.'

  Analysis: False. Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor did not make the statements attributed to her above. Some of the remarks attributed to President Obama and White House press secretary Robert Gibbs were made by them, though not, of course, in this fictitious context. In short, the 'news story' quoted above is pure satire, originally posted June 2, 2009 on the Carbolic Smoke Ball website, self-described as 'Proud publishers of fake news since 2005.' The point of the spoof was to lampoon a controversial remark Sotomayor actually did make in 2001, namely the suggestion that judges' life experiences and ethnic backgrounds play a role in their decision making. 'I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,' she said in a speech delivered at the UC Berkeley School of Law. When confronted in a recent TV interview with the substance of Sotomayor's 2001 remark, which some have criticized as 'racist,' President Obama responded as follows:

house, all heated by gas.  In one month this residence consumes more 
energy than ! the ave rage American household does in a  year.  The
average bill for electricity and natural gas  runs over $2400.  In
natural gas alone, this property consumes  more  than 20 times the
national average for an American home.  This house is not situated
in a Northern or Midwestern 'snow belt' area. It's in the South. House #2 Designed by an architecture professor at a
leading national university.  This house  incorporates every
'green' feature current home construction can  provide.  The house is
4,000 square feet (4 bedrooms) and  is nestled on a high prairie in the

  Circulating online, a viral quote in which Teddy Roosevelt says that every immigrant must become 'an American, and nothing but an American,' forsaking their native language for English and all other flags for the American flag.
  Description: Viral quote Circulating since: October 2005 Status: Authentic / Erroneously dated
  Example: Email contributed by Alan H., Oct. 29, 2005:
  Theodore Roosevelt on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN
  Are we 'SLOW LEARNERS' or what?
  Theodore Roosevelt on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN
  'In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man's becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile...We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language...and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.'
  Theodore Roosevelt 1907

  Analysis: Theodore Roosevelt indeed wrote these words, but not in 1907 while he was still President of the United States. The passages were culled from a letter he wrote to the president of the American Defense Society on January 3, 1919, three days before Roosevelt died (he served as president from 1901 to 1909).
  'Americanization' was a favorite theme of Roosevelt's during his later years, when he railed repeatedly against 'hyphenated Americans' and the prospect of a nation 'brought to ruins' by a 'tangle of squabbling nationalities.'
  He advocated the compulsory learning of English by every naturalized citizen. 'Every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or to leave the country,' he said in a statement to the Kansas City Star in 1918. 'English should be the only language taught or used in the public schools.'
  He also insisted, on more than one occasion, that America has no room for what he called 'fifty-fifty allegiance.' In a speech made in 1917 he said, 'It is our boast that we admit the immigrant to full fellowship and equality with the native-born. In return we demand that he shall share our undivided allegiance to the one flag which floats over all of us.'
  And in an article called 'True Americanism' authored by Roosevelt in 1894, he wrote:
  The immigrant cannot possibly remain what he was, or continue to be a member of the Old-World society. If he tries to retain his old language, in a few generations it becomes a barbarous jargon; if he tries to retain his old customs and ways of life, in a few generations he becomes an uncouth boor.

  Hillary Clinton could become the first female President of the United States. That reality alone has been the primary driver of Hillary's political existence. She rode her husbands coattails all the way to the US Senate. She ran in New York, of course, because the long-time Arkansan would be given a clear path to victory there. This would then set the stage for the obvious plan that the Clinton's had to continue the dynasty and return to the White House. In 2008, Hillary was the inevitable Democratic candidate. She lost, of course, but she is once again the inevitable candidate heading into 2016. Many think she will coast to victory as the chance for yet another new 'first' will over-ride all other concerns. Sadly, they might be right. But here are five reasons why they are probably, or at least hopefully, wrong.
  1: People like the Idea of Hillary Clinton More than the Actually Like Hillary Clinton
  Any realistic analysis of polls over the last 25 years or so points to one reality: People really just like the idea of Hillary Clinton, and not so much the person who winds up in front of them at the end of the day?
  continue reading below our video
  Profile of Hillary Clinton
  She could break the 'glass ceiling' at the White House. She has the Clinton name, even if she reluctantly changed it from Hillary Rodham to appease the more socially conservative tyes in Arkansas. Her resume shows she has the experience, pointing to her time as a First Lady, US Senator, and Secretary of State. She is often quite popular, but usually only when she hasn't been heard of for months at a time. Once she sticks her head out of the sand he number quickly start to drop.
  When Hillary was pushing socialized medicine as First Lady in the early 90s she wasn't very popular. Once she backed away from pushing her healthcare agenda and the Clinton Administration went moderate she regained her political footing and scored in the 60% favorable range. She was overwhelmingly popular until she ran for US Senate in 2001 and became a political monster once again, where she quickly fell underwater in popularity once again. As a US Senator and constant Bush nemesis, she had middling numbers throughout most of her time as Senator. That lasted until 2006 when the next presidential election was getting serious consideration and the 'chatter' about possibly having the first female President boosted her numbers north of 50% in most polls. And then she announced her intentions in 2007, started campaigning, and she fell to break-even at best and, more often than not, slightly underwater once people got a feel for her once again.
  When she jumped to the State Department under President Obama, her numbers soared into the mid-60s as no-one heard from her for months at a time and she was once again the 'ideal' candidate. She was also, once again, the inevitable first female POTUS. High approvals ratings followed her State Department tenure and first 2 years of 'retirement' as people continued to not see much of her. Then in 2014 she re-emerged to defend her questionable State record and she launched a ho-hum book as part of her re-introduction to the public. According to Gallup tracking , she would fall from 64% favorable in 2013 to 59% by February 2014 and then to 54% by June. Notice that every low point on the Gallup bar graph is when Hillary is most visible and her high points are when she has seemingly disappeared. Conclusion: People like the idea of Hillary more than Hillary herself. Perhaps if she could make it to election day without having to make a public appearance she would win in a landslide.
  2: She is a Woman Without a Philosophy
  Who is Hillary Clinton and who really knows what she believes? That's the problem Hillary will have once again in 2016. In 2008, she ran as a 'moderate' in her primary thinking the nomination was going to be hers. She lost to Barack Obama who ran clearly to her left. How will she appease progressives in 2016 and how will it hurt her moderate positioning? Can she tip-toe around Obamacare and the economic mess she would inherit should she win? She likes to leave much up to the imagination when it comes to her philosophy. This can be a problem when it enables others to define her better than she defines herself. She my also mistakenly think that she can win by running as a far lefty since Barack did, but he did not win because of his liberal ideas. (See #3 and #5 as to what Obama offered that she does not.)
  3: She is Not New
  For a party that prides itself on being young and fresh and hip, the Democrats have a 'freshness' deficit on their hands when compared to Republicans. Hillary has been around for almost three decades now and that doesn't exactly bring excitement. Hot on her heals is Joe Biden, who was first elected to the US Senate when Richard Nixon was President. The potential of electing the first female POTUS lost out to the freshness and newness of Barack Obama. Unless the GOP runs off and nominates someone like Jeb Bush, the party will undoubtedly have the fresher, younger, more exciting candidate.
  4: She is Accomplishment Free
  There are few things more entertaining in life than asking a Hillary Clinton supporter to name an accomplishment. Sure, Barack Obama had few accomplishments under his belt before becoming President. Heck, he once claimed that running his large campaign team was an accomplishment and that living in Indonesia as a kid qualified as solid foreign policy experience. But he also hadn't been a national figure for more than two decades. He certainly didn't have the resume Hillary has and, yet, nothing. Her main policy goal as First Lady was a disaster. She had nothing to show for in eight years as a US Senator. And her time as Secretary of State was mostly just failure on top of disappointment.
  5: Hillary is Actually Quite Dull
  Here is Hillary's real problem: She is dull. Like, a knife made out of butter dull. We can all admit that Mitt Romney was quite a dull candidate for the Republicans. Al Gore was famously wooden, too. But Hillary just may break the glass ceiling on dullness. Every move is calculated. There is little spontaneity. This was a huge reason Barack Obama was able to sneak in and topple the chosen one. Barack was - to liberals at least - exciting. He was new, and fresh, and different. In the age of social media, dullness doesn't sell well. When was the last time someone talked about a rousing speak by Clinton? Marco Rubio gives them all the time. Rand Paul is specifically targeting the Democrats demographics. Ben Carson took the stage at a National Prayer Breakfast and insulted the President's policies as he sat just feet away. Dull doesn't get people to turn the television on, as was evident when few tuned in to see her first big prime-time interview to launch her new book.
  This isn't to say Hillary Clinton can't win. That would be stupid. But she isn't a Barack Obama and she probably isn't a lot of the Republican class of 2010, either. In the end, voters might ask for more than simply being able to check off the gender box for President. Obama offered a lot of reasons for a lot of people to vote for him in 2008. What else does Hillary have to offer?

  It's true that the feds had planned on keeping the business going until the brothel could be sold at auction (a scheme that became the butt of numerous jokes on late-night TV), but a U.S. judge refused to allow the bankruptcy trustee to assume the Ranch's business license. Instead, the IRS foreclosed on the property and auctioned it off a few months later.
  Various sources persist in claiming that the IRS itself ran the brothel in the interim, though the available evidence suggests otherwise. Just two weeks after the government took possession of Mustang Ranch, county commissioners banned prostitution there, saying they were tired of the 'circus' surrounding the case. The ban remained in place until the business reopened in December 1990 under 'new' ownership (unbeknownst to officials at the time, the original owner, Joe Conforte, had repurchased the Ranch under an assumed name).
  So, while it's accurate enough to say that the federal government 'owned' Mustang Ranch for approximately three months in 1990, the claim that government officials tried to run the brothel and failed appears to be unfounded.

"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/fl/Tomb-of-the-Unknown-Soldier-Urban-Legends.htm","Tomb of the Unknown Soldier - Urban Legends","2016-08-15 00:53:59","  By David Emery
  A message widely circulating since March 2004 purports to describe the lifelong duties of the Honor Guard of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery.
  This text contains a careless mix of fact and fiction. While some of the stated facts are accurate, others — such as the claim that the guards are forbidden to swear or drink alcohol, on duty or off, for the rest of their lives — are patently absurd. See the FAQ page of the Society of the Honor Guard of the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery for true facts about the Tomb Guards.
  The author of the apocryphal email is unknown.
  Here's sample email text contributed by Cathy F. on March 31, 2004:
  INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWNS
  1. How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the tomb of the Unknowns and why? 21 steps. It alludes to the twenty-one gun salute, which is the highest honor given any military or foreign dignitary.
  2. How long does he hesitate after his about face to begin his return walk and why? 21 seconds for the same reason as answer number 1.
  3. Why are his gloves wet? His gloves are moistened to prevent his losing his grip on the rifle.
  4. Does he carry his rifle on the same shoulder all the time, and if not, why not? He carries the rifle on the shoulder away from the tomb. After his march across the path, he executes an about face and moves the rifle to the outside shoulder.
  5. How often are the guards changed? Guards are changed every thirty minutes, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year.
  6. What are the physical traits of the guard limited to? For a person to apply for guard duty at the tomb, he must be between 5' 10' and 6' 2' tall and his waist size cannot exceed 30'.
  Other requirements of the Guard:
  They must commit two years of life to guard the tomb, live in a barracks under the tomb, and cannot drink any alcohol on or off duty for the rest of their lives. They cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives and cannot disgrace the uniform [fighting] or the tomb in any way.
  After two years, the guard is given a wreath pin that is worn on his lapel signifying he served as guard of the tomb. There are only 400 presently worn. The guard must obey these rules for the rest of his live or give up the wreath pin.
  The shoes are specially made with very thick soles to keep the heat and cold from their feet. There are metal heel plates that extend to the top of the shoe in order to make the loud click as they come to a halt. There are no wrinkles, folds or lint on the uniform. Guards dress for duty in front of a full-length mirror.
  For the first six months of duty a guard cannot talk to anyone nor watch TV. All off duty time is spent studying the 175 notable people laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. A guard must memorize who they are and where they are interred. Among the notables are: President Taft, Joe E. Lewis [the boxer] and Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy, [the most decorated soldier of WWII] of Hollywood fame. Every guard spends five hours a day getting his uniforms ready for guard duty.

"Wall Street Bailout as Nigerian Scam","https://www.thebalance.com/electronic-funds-transfer-act-efta-1947655","What You Should Know About The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA)","2010-02-25 21:06:43","  An identity thief can get access to your bank account several ways. Stealing your debit card is the most common access point, but it's not the only one. For instance, when you pay for something by check, you’re handing over your bank account number and routing information to the merchant, the salesperson and anyone else involved in the processing of your purchase. Armed with this information, identity thieves need only make a small investment in the right kind of check printing software to begin stealing money from your bank account.
  There is a lot of terminology to be familiar with when dealing with bank account identity theft. When someone gains unauthorized access to your bank account, the act is a form of identity theft . But the bank may call it account fraud, unauthorized withdrawal, or even true-name fraud. Whatever language is used, you will need to know what to do and how you're protected. The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) provides you some protection from bank account fraud, but it's limited. If you believe that an identity thief has gotten a hold of your debit card , you must take action immediately.
  The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) provides banks with some guidelines on how to resolve disputes with ATM/debit cards. But the onus is on you, the account holder, to recognize unauthorized transactions on your account.
  To catch bank account identity fraud sooner rather than later, make a habit of reconciling your bank account each month when you receive your bank statement. If you have numerous deposit and debit transactions, reconciling your account twice a month could be a wise habit. If you notice an error, report it immediately.
  If you wait, you could be out of luck. According to the EFTA, you have limited liability for the losses you incur.:
  To begin investigating your claim, you must provide certain information to your bank. The following details are helpful in determining the steps the bank needs to take to resolve your dispute, based on EFTA rules:
  Many banks request that you provide this information in writing no later than 10 days after you initiate a dispute .
  If the account has been active for more than 30 days, the bank will do an investigation and get back to you within 10 days. If they need more time, they can take up to 45 days, but will credit the funds back to your account while they investigate.
  The bank should inform you if the investigation will take longer than normal.
  If the account is less than 30 days old, or you’re disputing point-of-sale or foreign transactions, they may take up to 20 days to apply the temporary credit to your account. They may also take up to 90 days to finish their investigation.
  If the bank's investigation doesn’t support your claims, they will notify you in writing, and take the credits back from your account. One reason they may not support your claim is excessive use by an authorized user. In other words, if you let your son use your card , and he spends more than you told him he could, the bank won't consider that an identity theft (because you gave him permission to use the card.)​

"War and Pizza","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/a/war_and_pizza.htm","Military Sociology","2012-02-02 20:24:06","  By Ashley Crossman
  Military sociology is the sociological study of the military. It examines issues such as military recruiting, race and gender representation in the military, combat, military families, military social organization, war and peace, and the military as welfare.
  Military sociology is a relatively minor subfield within the field sociology. There are few universities that offer courses on military sociology and only a handful of academic professionals that conduct research and/or write about military sociology. In recent years, most of the studies that can be classified as military sociology have been done by private research institutes or in military agencies, such as the Rand Corporation , the Brookings Institute , the Human Resources Research Organization , the Army Research Institute , and the Office of the Secretary of Defense . Furthermore, the research teams that conduct these studies are generally interdisciplinary, with researchers from sociology, psychology, political science, economics, and business.
  This by no means implies that military sociology is a small field. The military is the largest single government agency in the United States and the issues addressed surrounding it can have important ramifications for both military policy and the development of sociology as a discipline.
  Following are some of the issues studied under military sociology:
  The Basis of Service. One of the most significant issues in military sociology in the United States post-World War II is the shift from drafting to voluntary service. This was a huge change and one whose impact at the time was unknown. Sociologists were and still are interested in how this change affected society, who the individuals were who entered the military voluntarily and why, and whether this change affected the representativeness of the military (for example, are there more uneducated minorities who enter voluntarily than were selected in the draft)?
  Social Representation and Access. Social representation refers to the degree in which the military represents the population from which it has been drawn. Sociologists are interested in who is being represented, why the misrepresentations exist, and how representativeness has changed throughout history. For example, in the Vietnam War era, some civil rights leaders alleged that African Americans were overrepresented in the armed forces and therefore accounted for an unfair amount of casualties. Gender representation also developed as a major concern during the women’s rights movement, generating major policy changes concerning the participation of women in the military. In more recent years, when President Bill Clinton overturned the military ban on gays and lesbians, sexual orientation became the focus of major military policy debate for the first time. This topic has come into the spotlight once again after President Barack Obama repealed the 'Don’t ask, don’t tell' policy so that gays and lesbians can now serve openly in the military.
  Sociology of Combat. The study of the sociology of combat deals with the social processes involved in combat units. For example, researchers often study unit cohesion and morale, leader-troop relations, and the motivation for combat.
  Family Issues. The proportion of military personnel who are married has increased greatly over the past fifty years, which means there are also more families and family concerns represented in the military. Sociologists are interested in looking at family policy issues, such as the role and rights of military spouses and the issue of child-care when single-parent military members are deployed. Sociologists are also interested in military benefits related to families, like housing improvements, medical insurance, overseas schools, and child care, and how they impact both the families and the larger society.
  The Military as Welfare. Some people argue that one of the military’s roles is to provide opportunity for occupational and educational advancement to the less advantaged in society. Sociologists are interested in looking at this role of the military, who takes advantage of the opportunities, and whether the training and experience of the military offer any advantages compared to civilian experiences.
  Social Organization. The organization of the military has changed in many ways over the past several decades – from the draft to voluntary enlistment, from combat-intensive jobs to technical and support jobs, and from leadership to rational management. Some people argue that the military is changing from an institution legitimized by normative values to an occupation legitimized by a market orientation. Sociologists are interested in studying these organizational changes and how they impact both those in the military and the rest of society.
  War and Peace. For some, the military is immediately associated with war, and sociologists are certainly interested in examining different aspects of war. For example, what are the consequences of war for societal change? What are the sociological impacts of war, both at-home and abroad? How does war lead to policy changes and shape the peace of a nation?

"Barack Obama's 'Muslim' Wedding Ring","http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/fl/Obamas-Muslim-Ring.htm","Obama's Muslim Ring?","2016-08-16 23:20:36","  By David Emery
  Contrary to Internet rumors, President Barack Obama's gold wedding ring does not feature the Muslim saying 'No God but Allah' in Arabic script. It bears no visible inscription at all; rather, it is an abstract design.
  Such a claim might apparently confirm long-standing rumors that Barack Obama is not a Christian but rather a Muslim. The alleged phrase that's claimed to be in the ring’s design is part of the shahada, the First Pillar of Islam and the declaration of belief that followers of Islam must abide by in order to be counted as Muslims. The second part of the shahada is “Muhammad is the prophet of God.” The rumor also makes the assertion that the president has been wearing the ring, which seemingly now is also his wedding band, for the past 30 years, dating back to his days at Harvard. It would incongruous, though, for Obama to deny that allegation while opening wearing and flaunting a symbol in support of those rumors.
  As you can see in the viral illustration, someone has worked very diligently to make it appear as though certain Arabic characters match certain lines and shadows on the face of Obama's ring. But, as you can also see, the alleged correspondence isn't just forced, it's utterly reliant on the defects of the fuzzy, low-resolution images used.
  Compare those to the high-res close-up, in which you'll see nothing remotely resembling Arabic calligraphy, just abstract shapes. Albeit worn and damaged, the serpentine pattern in the upper half of the design mirrors that in the lower half. (More close-up views of the ring, showing other parts of it as well as the area supposedly containing Arabic writing, are available here and here .)
  If there's any inscription on the ring at all (not that there's any evidence to suggest there's one to be found), it would have to be on the inner surface where it's hidden from view.
  The Digital Journal took further steps to dispel the rumors by using three translation services --  'Translation Babylon,' 'Translate Google' and 'Translation Services USA' -- to look up the English to Arabic translation of the phrase 'No God but Allah.' When compared to the high-resolution image taken in 2009, the Arabic symbols found searching the three translation services did not match the ring.

  Circulating online, a viral quote in which Teddy Roosevelt says that every immigrant must become 'an American, and nothing but an American,' forsaking their native language for English and all other flags for the American flag.
  Description: Viral quote Circulating since: October 2005 Status: Authentic / Erroneously dated
  Example: Email contributed by Alan H., Oct. 29, 2005:
  Theodore Roosevelt on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN
  Are we 'SLOW LEARNERS' or what?
  Theodore Roosevelt on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN
  'In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man's becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile...We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language...and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.'
  Theodore Roosevelt 1907

  Analysis: Theodore Roosevelt indeed wrote these words, but not in 1907 while he was still President of the United States. The passages were culled from a letter he wrote to the president of the American Defense Society on January 3, 1919, three days before Roosevelt died (he served as president from 1901 to 1909).
  'Americanization' was a favorite theme of Roosevelt's during his later years, when he railed repeatedly against 'hyphenated Americans' and the prospect of a nation 'brought to ruins' by a 'tangle of squabbling nationalities.'
  He advocated the compulsory learning of English by every naturalized citizen. 'Every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or to leave the country,' he said in a statement to the Kansas City Star in 1918. 'English should be the only language taught or used in the public schools.'
  He also insisted, on more than one occasion, that America has no room for what he called 'fifty-fifty allegiance.' In a speech made in 1917 he said, 'It is our boast that we admit the immigrant to full fellowship and equality with the native-born. In return we demand that he shall share our undivided allegiance to the one flag which floats over all of us.'
  And in an article called 'True Americanism' authored by Roosevelt in 1894, he wrote:
  The immigrant cannot possibly remain what he was, or continue to be a member of the Old-World society. If he tries to retain his old language, in a few generations it becomes a barbarous jargon; if he tries to retain his old customs and ways of life, in a few generations he becomes an uncouth boor.
